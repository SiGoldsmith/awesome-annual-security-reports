## Executive summary
The Cost of a Data Breach Report offers IT, risk management 
and security leaders a lens into factors that can increase or help 
mitigate the rising cost of data breaches. 
Now in its 17th year, this research — conducted independently 
by Ponemon Institute, and sponsored, analyzed and published 
by IBM Security® — studied 550 organizations impacted by data 
breaches that occurred between March 2021 and March 2022. 
The breaches occurred across 17 countries and regions and in 
17 different industries.

We conducted more than 3,600 interviews with individuals from 
organizations that were impacted by the data breaches. During 
the interviews, we asked questions to determine the cost to 
organizations across different activities related directly to both 
the immediate and prolonged response to the data breaches.

As in previous years’ reports, this year’s data provides a view 
of how dozens of factors impact the costs that keep adding up 
after a data breach occurs. Additionally, the report examines 
root causes, short-term and long-term consequences of data 
breaches, and the mitigating factors and technologies that 
allowed companies to limit losses.

## What’s new in the 2022 report
With each year’s edition, we aim to build upon past research 
to keep up with changing technology and events. We also try 
to form a more relevant picture of the risks and strategies 
for securing data and responding to a breach, from artificial  
intelligence (AI) to zero trust. Covering some of the technologies 
most companies focused on in the past year, the 2022 edition of 
this report has new analysis related to the value of the following:
	
– Extended detection and response (XDR) 
	
– The use of risk quantification techniques
	
– Impacts of individual technologies that contribute to a 
zero trust security framework, such as identity and access 
management (IAM) and multifactor authentication (MFA)

Furthermore, the report takes a broader look at some leading 
contributors to higher data breach costs. For the first time, the 
report looks at the effects of supply chain compromises and  
the security skills gap. 

The report examines areas of security vulnerability from the 
cloud to critical infrastructure. And we take a deeper dive than 
past years into the impacts of ransomware and destructive 
attacks. Also studied is the phenomenon of remote work that 
continues to be a reality for many organizations past the peak  
of the COVID pandemic.

As companies experience more breaches and costs continue  
to climb, this report can serve as a tool to help your teams  
better manage risk and limit potential losses. 

The report is divided into the following five major sections: 
	
– The executive summary with key findings and what’s  
new in the 2022 edition
	
– In-depth analysis on the complete findings, including  
breach costs by geographic region and industry 
	
– Security recommendations from IBM Security experts  
based on this report’s results
	
– Demographics of organizations and industry definitions
	
– The study’s methodology, including how costs  
were calculated

IBM Security and Ponemon Institute are pleased to present  
the results of the 2022 Cost of a Data Breach Report.

Significantly, for the first time, the research 
shows the following insights:
**83%** 
of organizations studied have had more  
than one data breach.
**60%** 
of organizations’ breaches led to increases  
in prices passed on to customers.
**79%** 
of critical infrastructure organizations didn’t 
deploy a zero trust architecture.
**19%** 
of breaches occurred because of a  
compromise at a business partner.
**45%** 
of the breaches were cloud-based.

## Key findings
The key findings described here are based on IBM Security 
analysis of research data compiled by Ponemon Institute.1

**USD 4.35 million**
Average total cost of a data breach

Reaching an all-time high, the cost of a data breach averaged 
USD 4.35 million in 2022. This figure represents a 2.6%  
increase from last year, when the average cost of a breach was 
USD 4.24 million. The average cost has climbed 12.7% from  
USD 3.86 million in the 2020 report.

**83%**
Percentage of organizations that have  
had more than one breach

Eighty-three percent of organizations studied have experienced 
more than one data breach, and just 17% said this was their  
first data breach. Sixty percent of organizations studied stated 
that they increased the price of their services or products 
because of the data breach. 

**USD 4.82 million**
Average cost of a critical infrastructure  
data breach

The average cost of a data breach for critical infrastructure 
organizations studied was USD 4.82 million — USD 1 million 
more than the average cost for organizations in other industries. 
Critical infrastructure organizations included those in the 
financial services, industrial, technology, energy, transportation, 
communication, healthcare, education and public sector 
industries. Twenty-eight percent experienced a destructive or 
ransomware attack, while 17% experienced a breach because  
of a business partner being compromised.

**USD 3.05 million**
Average cost savings associated with fully  
deployed security AI and automation

Breaches at organizations with fully deployed security AI 
and automation cost USD 3.05 million less than breaches at 
organizations with no security AI and automation deployed. This 
65.2% difference in average breach cost — between USD 3.15 
million for fully deployed versus USD 6.20 million for not 
deployed — represented the largest cost savings in the study. 
Companies with fully deployed security AI and automation also 
experienced on average a 74-day shorter time to identify and 
contain the breach, known as the breach lifecycle, than those 
without security AI and automation — 249 days versus 323 days. 
The use of security AI and automation jumped by nearly one-fifth 
in two years, from 59% in 2020 to 70% in 2022.

**USD 4.54 million**
Average cost of a ransomware attack, not  
including the cost of the ransom itself

Eleven percent of breaches in the study were ransomware attacks, 
an increase from 2021, when 7.8% of breaches were ransomware, 
for a growth rate of 41%. The average cost of a ransomware 
attack went down slightly, from USD 4.62 million in 2021 to 
USD 4.54 million in 2022. This cost was slightly higher than the 
overall average total cost of a data breach, USD 4.35 million.

**19%**
Frequency of breaches caused by stolen  
or compromised credentials

Use of stolen or compromised credentials remains the most 
common cause of a data breach. Stolen or compromised 
credentials were the primary attack vector in 19% of breaches in 
the 2022 study and also the top attack vector in the 2021 study, 
having caused 20% of breaches. Breaches caused by stolen or 
compromised credentials had an average cost of USD 4.50 million. 
These breaches had the longest lifecycle — 243 days to identify 
the breach, and another 84 days to contain the breach. Phishing 
was the second most common cause of a breach at 16% and 
also the costliest, averaging USD 4.91 million in breach costs.

**59%**
Percentage of organizations that don’t  
deploy zero trust

Just 41% of organizations in the study said they deploy a 
zero trust security architecture. The other 59% percent of 
organizations that don’t deploy zero trust incur an average of 
USD 1 million in greater breach costs compared to those that 
do deploy. Among critical infrastructure organizations, an even 
higher percentage of 79% doesn’t deploy zero trust. These 
organizations experienced on average USD 5.40 million in breach 
costs, more than USD 1 million higher than the global average.

**USD 1 million**
Average difference in cost where remote  
work was a factor in causing the breach  
versus when it wasn’t a factor

When remote working was a factor in causing the breach, costs 
were an average of nearly USD 1 million greater than in breaches 
where remote working wasn’t a factor — USD 4.99 million versus 
USD 4.02 million. Remote work-related breaches cost on average 
about USD 600,000 more compared to the global average.

**45%**
Share of breaches that occurred in the cloud

Forty-five percent of breaches in the study occurred in the cloud. 
Yet breaches that happened in a hybrid cloud environment cost 
an average of USD 3.80 million, compared to USD 4.24 million 
for breaches in private clouds and USD 5.02 million for breaches 
in public clouds. The cost difference was 27.6% between hybrid 
cloud breaches and public cloud breaches. Organizations with 
a hybrid cloud model also had shorter breach lifecycles than 
organizations that solely adopted a public or private cloud model.

**USD 2.66 million**
Average cost savings associated with an  
incident response (IR) team and regularly  
tested IR plan

Nearly three-quarters of organizations in the study said they had 
an IR plan, while 63% of those organizations said they regularly 
tested the plan. Having an IR team and an IR plan that was 
regularly tested led to significant cost savings. Businesses with 
an IR team that tested its IR plan saw an average of USD 2.66 
million lower breach costs than organizations without an IR team 
and that don’t test an IR plan. The difference of USD 3.26 million 
versus USD 5.92 million represents a 58% cost savings.

**29 days**
Savings in response time for those  
with extended detection and response  
(XDR) technologies

XDR technologies were implemented by 44% of organizations. 
Those organizations with XDR technologies saw considerable 
advantages in response times. Those organizations with XDR 
deployed shortened the breach lifecycle by about a month,  
on average, compared to organizations that didn’t implement 
XDR. Specifically, organizations took 275 days to identify and 
contain a breach with XDR deployed versus 304 days without 
XDR deployed. This figure represents a 10% difference in 
response times.

**12 years**
Consecutive years the healthcare industry  
had the highest average cost of a breach

Healthcare breach costs hit a new record high. The average 
breach in healthcare increased by nearly USD 1 million to reach 
USD 10.10 million. Healthcare breach costs have been the most 
expensive industry for 12 years running, increasing by 41.6% 
since the 2020 report. Financial organizations had the second 
highest costs — averaging USD 5.97 million — followed by 
pharmaceuticals at USD 5.01 million, technology at USD 4.97 
million and energy at USD 4.72 million.

**USD 9.44 million**
Average cost of a breach in the United States,  
the highest of any country

The top five countries and regions for the highest average cost 
of a data breach were the United States at USD 9.44 million, the 
Middle East at USD 7.46 million, Canada at USD 5.64 million, the 
United Kingdom at USD 5.05 million and Germany at USD 4.85 
million. The United States has led the list for 12 years in a row. 
Meanwhile, the country with the fastest growth rate over last 
year was Brazil, a 27.8% increase from USD 1.08 million to 
USD 1.38 million.

## Global highlights
The Cost of a Data Breach Report is a global report, comprising 
data from 17 countries and regions and 17 industries. In this 
section, we look at several key metrics at the level of global 
average, as well as comparative costs between countries and 
between industries. 

### Figure 1: The average cost of a data breach reached  a record high in 2022. 
The global average total cost of a data breach increased by 
USD 0.11 million to USD 4.35 million in 2022, the highest it’s 
been in the history of this report. The increase from USD 4.24 
million in the 2021 report to USD 4.35 million in the 2022 report 
represents a 2.6% increase. In the last two years, the average 
total cost has increased 12.7% from USD 3.86 million in the 
2020 report.

*Image Description: A line graph showing the average total cost of a data breach in USD millions from 2016 to 2022. The graph shows a general upward trend, starting at $3.62 million in 2016 and reaching $4.35 million in 2022.*

**USD 4.35 million**
Global average total cost of a data breach

### Figure 2: The per record cost of a data breach hit  a seven-year high. 
The global per record cost of a data breach in 2022 was 
USD 164, a 1.9% increase from USD 161 in 2021. The increase 
from USD 146 in 2020 is an increase of 12.3%. This study 
examines breaches sized between 2,200 and 102,000 records. 
It’s not consistent with this research to use the per record  
cost to calculate the cost of single or multiple breaches above 
102,000 records. For more information, see the “Research 
methodology” section.

*Image Description: A line graph showing the average per record cost of a data breach in USD from 2016 to 2022. The graph shows a general upward trend, starting at $158 in 2016 and reaching $164 in 2022.*

Average per record cost of a data breach

### Figure 3: The United States was the costliest country for average total cost of a data breach for the 12th year in a row.  
The top five countries or regions with the highest average  
cost of a data breach were:
1. The United States — USD 9.44 million
2. The Middle East — USD 7.46 million
3. Canada — USD 5.64 million
4. The United Kingdom — USD 5.05 million
5. Germany — USD 4.85 million

The United States had the highest average total cost of a data 
breach at USD 9.44 million, a 4.3% increase of USD 0.39 million, 
up from USD 9.05 million in 2021. Similar to last year, the Middle 
East region again had the second highest average total cost 
of a data breach, increasing from USD 6.93 million in 2021 to 
USD 7.46 million in 2022. This average cost was an increase of 
USD 0.53 million, or 7.6%. Canada was again the third highest 
cost country at USD 5.64 million, an increase of USD 0.24 million 
or 4.4%. The United Kingdom climbed to number four from 
eighth out of the 17 countries or regions, surpassing Germany, 
Japan and France in the ranking. The average total cost of a 
breach in the United Kingdom was USD 5.05 million, up from 
USD 4.67 million, an increase of USD 0.38 million, or 8.1%. 

Out of the 17 countries or regions studied, six — Germany, 
Japan, France, South Korea, Scandinavia and Turkey — saw a 
decrease in the average total cost of a data breach. Brazil, 16th 
on the list at USD 1.38 million, saw the largest relative cost 
increase, up USD 0.3 million or 27.8%. Turkey, 17th on the list, 
saw the largest relative cost decrease, falling from USD 1.91 
million to USD 1.11 million, a decrease of USD 0.8 million or 
42%. Broad swings in currency valuations, such as occurred in 
Turkey, can play a role in cost variations from year to year.

The chart lists 17 countries/regions with their respective average costs for 2021 and 2022, ranked from highest to lowest cost in 2022. The United States has the highest cost at $9.44 million in 2022.*

### Figure 4: Healthcare was highest cost industry for the 12th year in a row. 
The average total cost of a breach in healthcare increased from 
USD 9.23 million in the 2021 report to USD 10.10 million in 
2022, an increase of USD 0.87 million or 9.4%. Healthcare is one 
of the more highly regulated industries and is considered critical 
infrastructure by the US government. 

The top five industries by cost were unchanged in the order of 
ranking from the 2021 report. Following healthcare were the 
financial, pharmaceuticals, technology and energy industries. 
The financial industry saw an increase from USD 5.72 million 
in 2021 to USD 5.97 million in 2022, an increase of USD 0.25 
million or 4.4%. The industrial industry, comprised of chemical, 
engineering and manufacturing organizations, saw an increase 
from USD 4.24 million to USD 4.47 million in 2022, an increase 
of USD 0.23 million or 5.4%. The average total cost decreased  
slightly in four industries — pharmaceuticals, transportation, 
media and hospitality.

*Image Description: A bar chart showing the average cost of a data breach by industry in USD millions. The chart lists 17 industries with their respective average costs for 2021 and 2022, ranked from highest to lowest cost in 2022. Healthcare has the highest cost at $10.10 million in 2022.*

### Figure 5: Detection and escalation costs surpassed lost business costs as the largest of four cost categories comprising the cost of a data breach, for the first time in six years. 
Broken down into four cost categories — lost business, detection 
and escalation, notification and post breach response — the 
largest share of data breach costs in 2022 was detection and 
escalation. Detection and escalation costs increased from 
USD 1.24 million in 2021 to USD 1.44 million in 2022, an 
increase of USD 0.2 million or 16.1%. Detection and escalation 
costs include activities that enable a company to reasonably 
detect a breach. These costs include forensic and investigative 
activities; assessment and audit services; crisis management; 
and communications to executives and boards. 

For the first time in at least six years, lost business, at USD 1.42 
million in 2022, wasn’t the largest share of data breach costs. Lost 
business costs decreased from USD 1.59 million in 2021, a decrease 
of 10.7%. Lost business costs include activities that attempt to 
minimize the loss of customers, business disruption and revenue 
losses. These costs include business disruption and revenue losses 
from system downtime; cost of lost customers and acquiring new 
customers; and reputation losses and diminished goodwill. 

Notification costs and post breach response costs remained 
relatively unchanged from 2021 to 2022. See “How we calculate 
the cost of a data breach” in the “Research methodology” 
section for definitions of each of the four cost categories.

*Image Description: A stacked bar chart showing the average cost of a data breach divided into four segments (Notification, Post breach response, Detection and escalation, and Lost business cost) in USD millions from 2017 to 2022. The chart shows how the proportion of each cost segment has changed over time.*

### Figure 6: Most organizations in the study have experienced  more than one data breach. 
Of the 550 organizations in the study, just 17% said this was 
their first data breach. Eighty-three percent said this wasn’t their 
first data breach. With security teams handling more incidents 
every year and considering the impact of remote work on 
security, it’s likely the recurrence of breaches is climbing. 

*Image Description: A pie chart showing the percentage of organizations that have had a data breach. 17% of organizations said this was their first data breach, and 83% said this was not their first data breach.*

### Figure 7: A majority of organizations in the study said they  increased the price of their products and services as a result  of the data breach. 
In response to the question, 60% said they increased prices,  
and 40% said they didn’t increase prices. 

*Image Description: A pie chart showing the percentage of organizations that increased prices of products and services as a result of a data breach. 60% of organizations said they increased prices, and 40% said they did not.*

## Data breach lifecycle
The time elapsed between the first detection of the breach 
and its containment is referred to as the data breach lifecycle. 
The time to identify a breach describes the time it takes to 
detect that an incident has occurred. The time to contain a 
breach refers to the time it takes for an organization to resolve a 
situation when it’s been detected and ultimately restore service. 
These metrics can be used to determine the effectiveness of an 
organization’s incident response and containment processes.

### Figure 8: The mean or average time to identify and contain  a data breach fell from 287 days in 2021 to 277 days  in 2022, a decrease of 10 days or 3.5%. 
In 2022 it took an average of 207 days to identify the breach and 
70 days to contain the breach. In 2021 it took an average of 212 
days to identify the breach and 75 days to contain the breach. 
The 277-day average in 2022 means that if a breach occurred on 
January 1, it would take until October 4 of that year to identify 
and contain the breach. The 277-day average is consistent 
with the average over the past seven years, with a maximum 
difference of 11% between the lowest total, 257 days in 2017, 
and the highest total, 287 days in 2021.

*Image Description: A bar chart showing the average time to identify and contain a data breach in days from 2016 to 2022. The chart shows the mean time to identify and the mean time to contain a breach, as well as the total time.*

**277 days**
Average time to identify and contain  
a data breach

### Figure 9: A shorter data breach lifecycle continues to be  associated with lower data breach costs. 
A data breach lifecycle of less than 200 days was associated 
with an average cost of USD 3.74 million in 2022, compared to 
USD 4.86 million for breaches with a lifecycle of greater than 
200 days. This difference represents an average cost savings  
of USD 1.12 million, or 26.5%, for breaches with the shorter  
than 200-day lifecycle. 

The cost gap between a lifecycle longer than 200 days and a 
lifecycle shorter than 200 days was smaller in 2022 than in 
2021, when it was USD 1.26 million. The cost gap in 2022 — 
USD 1.12 million — is the same size as the cost gap in 2020. The 
cost gap has grown slightly over the past seven years, while the 
average cost of a data breach has also grown incrementally. The 
2021 cost gap of USD 1.26 million was the largest of the past 
seven years.

*Image Description: A bar chart showing the average cost of a data breach based on the data breach lifecycle in USD millions from 2016 to 2022. The chart compares the average cost of breaches with a lifecycle of less than 200 days to those with a lifecycle of greater than 200 days.*

### Figures 10a and 10b: Data breaches in high data protection regulatory environments, such as the healthcare, financial, energy, pharmaceuticals and education industries, tended to see costs accrue in later years following the breach. 
The difference between low and high regulatory environments 
showed up in a pronounced way two years or more after the data 
breach — the “longtail” costs. In highly regulated industries, an 
average of 24% of data breach costs were accrued more than 
two years after the breach occurred. This result compares to 
an average of 8% of costs accrued more than two years after a 
breach in low regulatory environments. 

In low regulatory environments, data breach costs tended to 
accrue in the first three to six months — where an average of 
24% of data breach costs accrued. In the overall average for 
2022, 52% of costs were incurred in the first 12 months, 29% in 
the second year after the breach and 19% more than two years 
after the breach. For highly regulated industries, 45% of costs 
accrued in the first year, 31% in the second year and 24% more 
than two years after the breach.

In the analysis of industries in the high regulation categories, we 
concluded that regulatory and legal costs may have contributed 
to higher costs in the years following a breach. 

Note: This analysis was comprised of a subset of 218 companies 
with historical data from previous breaches.

## Initial attack vectors
This section looks at the prevalence and cost of initial attack 
vectors of data breaches. The breaches in the study are divided 
into 10 initial attack vectors, ranging from accidental data loss 
and cloud misconfiguration to phishing, insider threats and 
stolen or compromised credentials. This section also compares 
the average time it takes to identify and contain breaches based 
on their initial attack vector.

### Figure 11: The most common initial attack vector in 2022  was stolen or compromised credentials, responsible for 19% of breaches in the study, at an average cost of USD 4.50 million. 
In 2022, the most common initial attack vectors were 
compromised credentials at 19% of breaches, phishing at  
16% of breaches, cloud misconfiguration at 15% of breaches 
and vulnerability in third-party software at 13% of breaches.  
The 2021 report saw the same order of the top four initial  
attack vectors. 

The costliest initial attack vector in 2022 on average was 
phishing at USD 4.91 million. Following phishing was business 
email compromise at USD 4.89 million and 6% of breaches, 
vulnerability in third-party software at USD 4.55 million and 
compromised credentials at USD 4.50 million.

Average cost of data breach with a phishing  
initial attack vector

*Image Description: A bar chart showing the average cost and frequency of data breaches by initial attack vector. The chart shows the average cost in USD millions and the frequency as a percentage for 10 different attack vectors.*

### Figure 12: Attack vectors with longer mean times to identify and contain, such as phishing or business email compromise, were also among the most expensive types of breaches. 
Stolen or compromised credentials were the initial attack vector 
with the longest mean time to identify and contain the breach, at 
327 days. That time is 16.6% greater than the overall mean time 
to identify and contain a data breach. Compromised credentials 
were also the most common — 19% — initial attack vector 
leading to data breaches in the study. 

Breaches caused by business email compromise had the second 
highest mean time to identify and contain, at 308 days. Business 
email compromise was also the second costliest initial attack 
vector, with breaches costing an average of USD 4.89 million. 
Breaches caused by phishing had the third highest mean time to 
identify and contain, at 295 days, and had the highest average 
cost by initial attack vector, at USD 4.91 million. Vulnerability in 
third-party software had the fourth highest mean time to identify 
and contain a breach, with an average that was above the overall 
average — 284 days versus 277 days.

## Key cost factors
This section looks at a multitude of factors that influence 
the cost of a data breach, including various types of security 
technologies and practices. A special analysis of 28 cost factors 
examines their impact on the mean cost of a data breach. We 
look at how these 28 factors were associated with either lower-
than-average breach costs stemming from a cost mitigating 
influence, or a higher-than-average cost of a breach resulting 
from a cost amplifying influence. 

The following cost factors are new to the report this year: IAM; 
XDR technologies; MFA; and crisis management teams. 

These cost factors aren’t additive, so it’s not consistent with this 
research to add multiple cost factors together to calculate the 
cost of a breach.

**USD 5.57 million**
Average cost of a breach for organizations  
with high levels of compliance failures

### Figure 13 shows the impact of 28 factors on the average  cost of a data breach. 
The chart shows the average cost difference of breaches at 
organizations with these cost-influencing factors compared to 
the mean cost of a data breach of USD 4.35 million. The chart is 
divided into those factors that are associated with a lower- 
than-average breach cost, which are cost mitigators, and those 
factors that are associated with a higher-than-average breach 
cost, or cost amplifiers. 

AI platforms, a DevSecOps approach and use of an incident 
response (IR) team were the three factors associated with the 
highest cost decrease compared to the mean cost of a breach. 
For example, breaches at organizations with AI platforms had 
an average cost that was USD 300,075 less than the mean cost 
of a data breach of USD 4.35 million — which is approximately 
USD 4.05 million.
