Ransomware
The True Cost to Business

A Global Study on Ransomware Business Impact

INTRODUCTION

CEO Insight

Ransomware continues to dominate the 
threat landscape in 2022\. Organizations are 
under siege from a wide variety of threats, 
but ransomware offers threat actors a 
unique combination of very low risk with very 
high reward—which is why the volume of 
ransomware attacks nearly doubled from the 
previous year, and the total cost of ransomware 
was estimated to exceed $20 billion.

Ransomware began as little more than a 
new type of malware exploit with a different 
payload—generating revenue by extorting 
payment from victims—but it has evolved into 
a complex business model. The malware is just 
one element of the much larger ransomware 
operation—or RansomOp—that make today’s 
attacks far more sophisticated and insidious. 

Cybercrime gangs like Darkside, the group 
behind the Colonial Pipeline attack, REvil, 
the group behind the JBS attack, and the 
Conti ransomware group, whose attacks on 
multiple government bodies led President 
Rodrigo Chaves of Costa Rica to declare 
a national emergency, have developed 
ransomware\-as\-a\-service models that 
mirror legitimate businesses, complete with 
customer service, human resources, and a 
network of suppliers and partners.

Ransomware is also more sinister because 
of the increasingly blurred lines between 
cybercrime gangs and nation\-state 
adversaries who influence the objectives of 
ransomware attacks while also making it more 
difficult to bring the threat actors to justice.

RANSOMWARE\| INTRODUCTION CEO INSIGHT

I often refer to these groups as “state\-
ignored,” where nation\-state adversaries look 
the other way as long as the ransomware 
targets align with their strategic goals, or 
“state\-controlled,” where the threat actors 
are executing attacks on behalf of and at 
the direction of the nation\-state. The US 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
Agency (CISA) reported that 14 out of 16 
critical infrastructure sectors have been 
targeted by ransomware attacks. 

Organizations that are hit by a ransomware 
attack face a no\-win situation. The only options 
are to either ignore the ransom demand, 
rebuild and restore compromised systems 
from backups, and pray that the threat 
actor doesn’t leak or sell your organization’s 
sensitive data, or pay the ransom to obtain the 
decryption key from the attackers. 

While paying the ransom may seem like 
the easier choice, our research this year 
proves once again that it does not pay to 
pay. Organizations that paid a ransom were 
frequently unable to recover all of their data, 
and many were hit by additional ransomware 
attacks—often by the same threat actors.

Given the ongoing threat that these attacks 
pose to organizations, this second annual 
Ransomware: The True Cost to Business 
study examines how ransomware continues 
to impact the business, the outcomes 
organizations are reporting after having 
been the target of a ransomware attack, and 
the strategies companies large and small are 
implementing to better prepare for an attack.

Our mission is to enable Defenders to reverse 
the adversary advantage. To advance that 
goal and enable organizations to make better 
decisions about their security posture, we 
need concrete insights into the business 
impact of these attacks. This report reveals 
the true cost and impact of ransomware, 
and it underscores that organizations need 
to Defend Forward with more proactive 
approaches to cybersecurity. 

The best defense against ransomware 
attacks is to ensure your data is not stolen or 
encrypted in the first place through effective 
prevention, detection and response. It is 
my hope that your organizations will find 
this report insightful and that it will serve 
to inform your organization’s strategies to 
remain undefeated by ransomware.

Our mission is to enable 
Defenders to reverse the 
adversary advantage. To 
advance that goal and help 
organizations to make better 
decisions about their security 
posture, we need concrete 
insights into the business 
impact of these attacks.

RANSOMWARERansomware Remains 
Pervasive

Ransomware continues to be a dominant 
concern for organizations. Despite significant 
action by the Biden Administration in the US, 
coordinated efforts by government and law 
enforcement agencies around the world, and an 
increased focus on ransomware, the volume of 
attacks nearly doubled in 2021\. 

Of the 1400\+ cybersecurity professionals who 
participated in this second study, nearly three\-
quarters (73%) said their organization was 
targeted by at least one ransomware attack 
in the preceding 24 months, compared to just 
55% of companies who had been targeted by at 
least one attack in our 2021 report, a staggering 
increase of 33% year over year.

RANSOMWARE\| RANSOMWARE REMAINS PERVASIVE

Ransomware attacks can negatively 
impact an organization in many ways, with 
combined losses potentially reaching tens 
or even hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Last year’s study revealed that the vast 
majority of organizations that had suffered 
a ransomware attack also experienced 
a significant business impact, whether 
revenue loss, reputational damage, unplanned 
workforce reductions, or in some cases 
business disruption.. 

Short\-term impacts revealed in the report 
included disruption of critical business 
processes due to the inability to access 
critical systems and data, costs associated 
with incident response and other mitigation 
efforts, lost productivity, and the cost of the 
ransom payment itself if the organization 
chose to acquiesce to the extortion demand, 
among others. 

Longer\-term impacts included diminished 
revenue, damage to the organization’s brand 
and reputation, the loss of key executives, 
employee layoffs, loss of customers and 
strategic partners, and the viability of the 
business altogether in some instances.

The results demonstrated some regional 
deviations, with organizations in Japan (95%), 
Italy (90%), and the UK (83%) among the most 
likely to have been targeted by a ransomware 
attack in the preceding two\-year period, while 
organizations in the US (46%) and Germany 
(69%) were among the least likely to have been 
targeted.

While the majority of organizations 
participating in the study reported they were 
targeted by a ransomware attack, not all 
organizations experienced a negative business 
impact. Ransomware victims in the US fared 
the best (32%) and were least likely to have 
been negatively impacted. In comparison, 
organizations in Japan (69%), Italy (63%), and 
France (52%) were most likely to report an 
impact on their operations.

As well, there was some variance by industry 
vertical, with the Legal (92%), Manufacturing 
(78%), Financial Services (78%), and Human 
Resources (77%) sectors most likely to have 
been affected by a ransomware attack. 

Ransomware is a lucrative business that will 
continue to be a threat. Attackers continue to 
find innovative ways to extort victims, so it is 
more crucial than ever for organizations to be 
able to defend against ransomware attacks.

RANSOMWAREAre Organizations 
Prepared? Despite the ongoing cybersecurity talent 

shortage, the study revealed a significant 
increase in the number of respondents who 
believe their organizations have the right talent 
to defend against ransomware attacks: 88% 
this year vs. 60% last year, a nearly 50% increase 
year over year. 

The other good news: nearly three\-fourths 
of respondents indicated they believe their 
organization has the right contingency plans to 
manage a ransomware attack–a number that 
remained relatively unchanged year over year. 

Respondents from the UK indicated a 
higher level of confidence in their people 
and policies at 94% and 77%, respectively. In 
comparison, participants in France expressed 
less confidence at 82% and 53%, and those in 
Singapore expressed the least confidence at 
64% and 61%, respectively. By sector, Financial 
Services (95%) and Transportation (94%) had 
the highest confidence levels in their people, at 
95% and 94%, respectively, while Education had 
the lowest confidence level in its people, at 71%, 
and in its processes, at 53%. 

This is particularly concerning because 
colleges and school systems are frequent 
ransomware targets. Lincoln College, a 
157\-year\-old historically black college in the US, 
announced that it is permanently closing down 
after being unable to access recruitment and 
fundraising systems for months following a 
December 2021 ransomware attack.

RANSOMWARERansomware and the Impact 
to the Business

While many respondents believe their business is 
prepared for a ransomware attack, their faith may be 
misguided. Our year\-over\-year data shows a significant 
disconnect and a false sense of confidence between how 
prepared respondents say they are vs. how prepared 
their organizations actually are to deal with a successful 
ransomware attack. 

Of the organizations that reported losses from a ransomware attack, more than two\-thirds (67%) said their combined 
losses reached between $1 million and $10 million (USD), 
while 4% estimated staggering losses in the range of $25 million to $50 million.

RANSOMWAREWhy Organizations Choose 
to Pay a Ransom

Of the organizations that paid one or more 
ransom demands following successful attacks, 
nearly half (49%) said their primary motivation 
for paying was to avoid any loss of revenue, 
while 41% cited the need to expedite recovery 
as the main driver for payment, both of which 
seemingly make sense from a business viability 
and continuity standpoint.

Some companies decided to pay the 
ransom because they weren’t prepared 
for a ransomware attack. For example, 27% 
said they paid the ransom because they 
hadn’t backed up their data. One\-third (34%) 
indicated they were simply too short\-staffed 
to attempt an effective response without the 
assistance of the attackers, both of which are 
preventable conditions for organizations that 
take the threat of ransomware seriously and 
are indicators that these organizations simply 
aren't prepared.

\| WHY ORGANIZATIONS CHOOSE TO PAY A RANSOM

The decision to pay a ransom demand is 
not easy, especially for organizations with a 
critical infrastructure designation like those 
in the Healthcare sector. In cases where 
ransomware prevents access to crucial 
systems and data needed to provide care, the 
consequences could be dire the longer the 
attack persists. This urgency explains why 
nearly one\-third of respondents (28%) said 
they paid the ransom demand because any 
delays in remediation could result in injury or 
loss of life.

This research demonstrates that paying the 
ransom doesn’t guarantee a faster recovery 
from the attack, despite the claims attackers 
may make to entice organizations to pony up. In 
fact, of the organizations that reported having 
paid a ransom demand, only 42% said the 
payment resulted in restoration of all systems 
and data, a significant decrease from the 51% 
who said they fully recovered systems and 
data in the 2021 study. Furthermore, 54% said 
that system issues persisted or that some data 
was corrupted after decryption, up from 46% 
in 2021\. This data strongly suggests that it still 
does not pay to pay. 

Paradoxically, 78% of organizations that 
indicated they did not pay a ransom said 
they were able to fully restore systems and 
data without receiving the decryption key 
at all. Given the counterintuitive results here, 
one must ask why the outcomes would be 
better for organizations that did not pay a 
ransom. Were they simply better prepared to 
respond?

Paying the ransom DOESN’T GUARANTEE 
a faster recovery from the attack.

12

RANSOMWAREIt Still Does Not Pay to Pay

One of the toughest decisions a business 
will ever make is whether to pay a ransom 
demand following a successful attack. While 
remediation expediency is certainly a primary 
consideration, organizations need to weigh a 
host of other factors as well, including: 

 Will the attackers honor their promise 
to provide a decryption key and restore 
access to all systems and data? 

 What if the data gets corrupted 
during the decryption process? 

 What if the attackers reside in a country 
subject to sanctions where a ransom 
payment could be considered a criminal 
violation? 

 What if paying a ransom demand 
encourages the threat actors to launch 
another ransomware attack against the 
organization? 

 Aside from delayed data and system 
recovery, what are the other risks to the 
victim organization if the ransom demand is 
not met? 

13

RANSOMWARE 
 
 
 
 
\| IT STILL DOES NOT PAY TO PAY

This decision is particularly difficult for 
any organization to make in the heat of 
incident response. There are no clear\-cut 
best practices to follow that work for every 
organization in every circumstance. Every 
ransomware attack scenario needs to be 
evaluated on a case\-by\-case basis because 
each infiltration, attack group, victim 
organization, jeopardized data set, and 
impacted third\-party situation is unique, and 
there are numerous factors that need to be 
considered when determining whether or not 
to make a payment. 

That said, this research found that it clearly 
does not pay to pay. Of the organizations 
that chose to pay a ransom demand, the 
vast majority (nearly 80%) indicated they 
were victims of at least one subsequent 
ransomware attack. Of those who were hit 
a second time with ransomware, nearly half 
(48%) indicated the attack was perpetrated 
by the same attackers, which remained 
unchanged from the 2021 study. 

Two\-thirds (68%) who paid a ransom and were 
hit again reported that the second attack 
came less than a month after the first and that 
the threat actors demanded an even higher 
ransom amount the second time around. Of 
the organizations that paid a ransom following 
the first attack, nearly half (44%) also paid the 
second ransom demand, and nearly one in ten 
(9%) said they paid a ransom demand three 
times or more.

Let those statistics sink in: nearly 8\-out\-of\-10 
companies that paid a ransom were hit by a 
second ransomware attack—almost half of 
which were perpetrated by the same threat 
actors. Adding insult to injury, more than two\-
thirds of those subsequent attacks demanded 
a higher ransom than the initial attack, and 
nearly 6\-out\-of\-10 organizations were unable 
to recover all of their systems and data even 
after paying the ransom.

Nearly
80% of those 
who paid were hit 
a second time 
and close to half the time 
by the same attackers.

RANSOMWARE\| IT STILL DOES NOT PAY TO PAY

Our research found that certain industry 
segments are virtually guaranteed to be hit a 
second time after paying a ransom demand. 
Companies in the Legal (100%), Human 
Resources (100%), Engineering (91%), and 
Manufacturing (85%) sectors were most likely 
to have suffered a second attack after having 
paid a ransom. Larger organizations with more 
than 1,500 employees were also preferred 
targets for repeated attacks (88%). 

The big takeaway from both this year’s study 
and the last is that it really does not make 
sense to pay a ransom demand unless there 
is the risk of losses that go beyond monetary 
costs, such as when human life is at risk. 
Overall, the cost of preventing a ransomware 
attack from being successful is lower than the 
combined cost of paying the ransom and all the 
associated costs of recovery when responding 
to a successful ransomware attack–possibly 
multiple times by the same threat actor.

RANSOMWAREMost Dangerous Ransomware 
Attack Vectors

Ransomware attacks involve a variety of 
infection vectors, but ransomware actors 
traditionally prefer some methods over 
others. In a 2020 study, researchers found 
that unsecured Microsoft Remote Desktop 
Protocol (RDP) connections were leveraged in 
over half of all ransomware attacks. This was 
followed by phishing emails at approximately a 
quarter of all ransomware infections and the 
exploitation of software vulnerabilities at 12%.

A proprietary protocol developed by 
Microsoft, RDP enables users to connect to 
other computers over a network connection 
remotely. This protocol necessitates that both 
computers involved in the connection run RDP 
software.

As noted by ZDNet, some digital crime 
groups specialize in scanning the web for 
these exposed ports. When they find them, 
they carry out brute\-force attacks to gain 
access. They can then sell that access on 
Dark Web marketplaces, giving attackers 
like ransomware groups an opportunity 
to establish a foothold in an organization’s 
network.

Then there are the attacks that leverage 
exploits of known and unknown vulnerabilities. 
Let’s revisit the phishing scenario discussed 
above, in which an attack email has an 
embedded link that redirects a target to a 
website serving up an exploit kit. A phishing 
email might be the initial attack vector in this 
case, but it’s not the ransomware payload 
delivery method. 

In this case, the exploit kit functions as the 
delivery vector. It evaluates things like the 
target’s web browser, operating system, 
and/or other software running on the device 
for vulnerabilities. If it detects a supported 
vulnerability, the exploit kit activates to install 
ransomware on the victim’s machine.

16

RANSOMWAREEvolution of Ransomware 
Attacks to RansomOps

Ransomware attacks have evolved 
dramatically over the last few years, from a 
small cottage industry conducting essentially 
nuisance attacks like phishing and drive\-by 
exploits to a highly complex business model 
known for its efficiency, specialization, 
innovation, and technical sophistication. 

While broad, random attacks are still prevalent, 
ransomware purveyors are moving away from 
high\-volume attacks with low ransom demands 
in favor of more focused, custom attacks 
aimed at organizations selected for their ability 
and likelihood to pay multi\-million\-dollar ransom 
demands. It is becoming increasingly common 
for ransomware attacks to involve complex 
attack sequences in low\-and\-slow campaigns 
designed to infiltrate as much of the targeted 
network as possible versus infecting a single 
machine with the ransomware payload.

RANSOMWARE\| EVOLUTION OF RANSOMWARE ATTACKS TO RANSOMOPS

These more complex ransomware operations, 
or RansomOps, involve highly targeted, 
complex attack sequences conducted by 
sophisticated threat actors. Cybereason 
recently published a report titled RansomOps: 
Inside Complex Ransomware Operations and 
the Ransomware Economy that examines the 
growing threat from elaborate ransomware 
operations and the burgeoning Ransomware 
Economy and provides prescriptive guidance 
for organizations.

A joint report issued by the US, Australia, and 
the UK in early February 2022 and published 
by CISA specifically noted the increasing 
complexity observed in ransomware 
operations, stating, “ransomware tactics and 
techniques continued to evolve in 2021, which 
demonstrates ransomware threat actors’ 
growing technological sophistication and an 
increased ransomware threat to organizations 
globally.” 

Unlike early iterations of ransomware attacks 
that relied on "spray\-and\-pray" tactics to 
infect large numbers of victims while seeking 
relatively small ransom demands, RansomOps 
attacks are much more intricate and akin to 
the stealthy operations conducted by nation\-
state threat actors.

RansomOps also involve a great deal of 
reconnaissance on the targets, which are 
carefully chosen for their ability to pay 
substantial ransom demands and high 
likelihood to pay, given they may be in an 
industry with the potential for significant ripple 
effects should their operations be disrupted, 
such as with Healthcare and other critical 
infrastructure organizations. 

With a RansomOps campaign, the actual 
ransomware payload that encrypts data 
happens essentially at the tail\-end of the 
attack. Of the organizations that suffered 
a ransomware attack in the last 24 months, 
63% reported that the attackers were in 
their networks for up to six months before 
being detected, 21% said it was seven to twelve 
months of dwell time, and 16% said attackers 
were in their networks for a year or more 
before security teams became aware of the 
network compromise. 

The silver lining: there are potentially weeks 
or even months' of detectable activity that 
could allow organizations to disrupt an attack 
before it results in serious impact, provided 
they have the right tools in place to detect the 
RansomOps attack sequence early versus 
later in the kill chain at payload delivery (more 
on mitigation strategies below).

RANSOMWARESupply Chain Attacks 
on the Rise

“Supply chain vulnerabilities are amongst 
the most significant cyber threats facing 
organisations today,” said Lisa Fong, Director 
of New Zealand’s National Cyber Security 
Centre. “As organisations strengthen their 
own cyber security, their exposure to cyber 
threats in their supply chain increasingly 
becomes their weakest point. Organisations 
need to ensure they are implementing 
effective controls to mitigate the risk of cyber 
security vulnerabilities being introduced to 
their systems via technology suppliers such 
as managed service providers. They also need 
to be prepared to effectively respond when 
issues arise.”

In this study, most organizations (64%) that 
suffered a successful ransomware attack 
in the last 24 months indicated the primary 
infection vector was a third\-party supply 
chain compromise. Small to medium\-
sized organizations were more likely to 
be compromised via supply chain attacks, 
while larger organizations were more apt 
to be infected by direct attacks on their 
environments. 

The shift to more complex RansomOps attacks 
has also led to a rise in supply chain attacks. A 
supply chain attack enables attackers to focus 
on compromising just one organization, which 
then allows them to compromise the entire 
customer base. The attack against managed 
IT services provider Kaseya in 2021 that led to 
further attacks on their customers is a prime 
example of a supply chain attack. 

How serious is the supply chain threat? In May 
2022, CISA, the NSA, FBI, and an international 
coalition of cyber authorities issued a joint 
advisory warning of an increased risk of 
supply chain attacks designed to compromise 
Managed Services Providers (MSPs) and their 
customers.

RANSOMWAREData Exfiltration and Double 
Extortion

Organizations have adapted to the rising 
threat of ransomware attacks with improved 
data backup practices, so they can simply 
restore their data if necessary. Cybercriminals 
have responded by introducing additional 
incentives for organizations to pay the 
ransom. While lateral movement through 
the targeted network is a primary goal for 
RansomOps threat actors to maximize both 
the impact on the targeted organizations 
and the potential ransom payout, these 
more complex operations often also seek to 
exfiltrate sensitive data from the victim before 
detonating the encryption payload so they can 
leverage it to force a ransom payment through 
double extortion techniques. 

With double extortion, the ransomware 
encrypts the victim’s data and demands 
payment in exchange for a decryptor within 
the ransom note, as expected. However, the 
threat actor can also apply additional pressure 
to victims who would not usually pay a ransom 
by threatening to leak or sell the exfiltrated 
data. With double extortion, the options for 
organizations become more limited.

According to reports, only one ransomware 
gang was using the tactic in 2019, but by the end 
of Q1 2021, researchers observed ransomware 
attacks that included threats to publish 
exfiltrated data if a ransom demand was not 
paid had increased to 77% of all ransomware 
attacks. 

21

RANSOMWAREData Types 
Targeted for 
Double Extortion

22

The growth in double extortion raises an important question: what types of data 
do ransomware attackers tend to target for exfiltration to leverage for double 
extortion? It usually depends on the affected organization, but there are some 
common data categories that ransomware actors typically pursue:

 Protected Health Information 
(PHI): This includes medical records, 
diagnosis details, and patient medical 
insurance data. Attackers target 
this data category because they 
know that Healthcare organizations 
need anytime access to medical 
information to render patient care on 
a timely basis. Hence, they changed 
their tactics during the COVID\-19 
pandemic to include exfiltration of 
this kind of data.

 Personally Identifiable Information 
(PII): Which includes birth dates, 
physical addresses, email addresses, 
Social Security numbers (SSNs), 
and so on. Ransomware actors can 
monetize the information and sell it on 
the Dark Web as part of a complete 
identity profile. Buyers can then use 
that information to conduct different 
types of identity theft or fraud.

 Account Credentials: Consisting 
primarily of usernames and 
passwords, account credentials are 
essential to ransomware actors. 
Attackers need those details to infect 
as much of a target’s network as 
possible.

 Intellectual Property (IP): Intellectual 
property includes new product 
releases and/or details that are 
integral to a victim’s line of business 
or details on their customer base. As 
with the theft of sensitive personal 
details, ransomware actors can 
monetize a victim’s intellectual 
property on the Dark Web or hand it 
over to a state sponsor. A competing 
organization can then purchase the 
information on the black market 
and use it to undermine the victim’s 
business objectives. Alternatively, a 
competing state government can use 
it to advance their interests at the 
expense of the victim’s host country.

In our study, of the organizations that suffered a ransomware incident in the 
last two years, 54% indicated the attackers attempted to or actually exfiltrated 
sensitive customer data, 34% went after PII, 30% targeted intellectual property (IP), 
and 27% went after PHI.

The steady increase in the volume, complexity, 
and severity of ransomware attacks is 
driving increases in security budgets, with 
86% of respondents indicating an increase 
in their security budgets to defend against 
ransomware attacks. Overall, two\-thirds (66%) 
of respondents stated their security programs 
increased significantly\-between 11% and 50%.

The average increase in security budgets 
across all participants in the study was 20%, 
demonstrating that ransomware is among 
the leading drivers for security spending 
across organizations of all sizes and industry 
verticals. So, where are organizations investing 
the extra budget to reduce the risk posed by 
ransomware attacks? This study reveals that 
budget allocations for cyber insurance policies 
were the top line item for increased spending.

\| IMPACT ON SECURITY BUDGETS

Since it was introduced to the market, cyber 
insurance adoption has been rapid and 
widespread, with 93% of respondents indicating 
their organizations have a cyber insurance 
policy in place, up from 75% in the 2021 report. 
Of those with cyber insurance, 84% indicated 
their policies include coverage specifically for 
ransomware attacks, up from just 54% in last 
year’s report.

Generally, the larger the organization, the less 
likely they were to have cyber insurance for 
ransomware attacks. In fact, the larger the 
company, the less likely they were to have any 
cyber insurance at all, with 9% of companies 
with 1,500 or more employees reporting no 
cyber insurance protection.

The other budget winners in the effort to 
counter ransomware attacks were hiring 
additional security talent at 51% and additional 
security awareness training for employees 
at 50%. Organizations in Germany and Japan 
were most likely to invest more funds into 
hiring at 61% and 60%, respectively, while 
organizations in the UAE (40%) and Singapore 
(41%) were the least likely to spend the 
additional budget on new hires.

Surprisingly, the addition of new security 
technologies like NGAV, Endpoint Protection, 
and Endpoint Detection and Response solutions 
was a priority for 47% of organizations. It is 
interesting to note that investment in new 
technologies designed to prevent or disrupt 

ransomware attacks was only the fourth 
most common choice for where to allocate 
additional security budget. 

This may be due to the fact that most of 
the organizations participating in the study 
have already made significant investments 
in prevention, detection and response 
solutions, but given the level of increased 
investment in cyber insurance, one might 
conclude that these organizations are not 
necessarily confident that they have the right 
solutions in place to adequately defend against 
ransomware attacks.

While cyber insurance can be an effective 
tool for transferring some of the risk of a 
ransomware attack, it doesn’t mitigate all of it or 
provide any meaningful defense. Even if a cyber 
insurance policy covers a ransom demand, 
it may not cover a number of other financial 
consequences, such as lost revenue, cost of 
remediation, higher insurance premiums, 
regulatory fines, legal fees, and the like. 

What’s more, cyber insurance will not protect 
an organization from being among the 8\-out\-
of\-10 that are hit with a second ransomware 
attack—and it is doubtful that cyber insurance 
would cover back\-to\-back ransom payments 
within a month.

RANSOMWAREDefending Against Ransomware 
and RansomOps Attacks

Once an organization has been compromised 
with ransomware, no clear\-cut “best option” 
is available. If the ransom is not paid, business 
may grind to a halt for days or weeks as data is 
manually restored from backups–assuming 
the organization has backups. 

If a ransomware attack includes data 
exfiltration for double extortion, not paying 
the ransom also means accepting the risk that 
sensitive data and intellectual property may be 
exposed publicly–and the legal and regulatory 
consequences that can stem from such 
exposure. Again, the financial, legal, regulatory, 
and reputational impact of a ransomware 
attack–including lost business and productivity 
and the cost of recovery efforts–can often 
exceed the ransom demand. 

The alternative is to pay the ransom, but 
that comes with issues and risks as well. As 
noted earlier, many organizations that pay 
the ransom are able to regain access to their 
data but find that some or all of it has been 
corrupted. The decryption tool provided by 
ransomware attackers is often buggy or 
slow, forcing companies to restore from their 
backups even after paying the ransom. There 
is also no guarantee that your data won’t still be 
sold online after paying the ransom. 

The best option for defending against 
ransomware is to be proactive and prevent an 
attack at the outset, to detect and disrupt an 
attack in progress as early as possible, and to 
be prepared to respond to a successful attack 
swiftly.

RANSOMWARE\| DEFENDING AGAINST RANSOMWARE AND RANSOMOPS ATTACKS

 Follow Security Hygiene Best Practices: 
This includes timely patch management 
and ensuring operating systems and other 
software are regularly updated, offsite 
data backups, implementing a security 
awareness program for employees, and 
deploying best\-in\-class security solutions 
on the network.

 Implement Multi\-Layer Prevention 
Capabilities: Prevention solutions like 
NGAV should be standard on all enterprise 
endpoints across the network to thwart 
ransomware attacks leveraging both 
known TTPs as well as custom malware.

 Deploy Endpoint and Extended Detection 
and Response (EDR and XDR): Point 
solutions for detecting malicious activity 
like a RansomOps attack across the 
environment provides the visibility required 
to end ransomware attacks before data 
exfiltration occurs or the ransomware 
payload can be delivered.

 Ensure Key Stakeholders Can Be Reached: 
Responders should be available at any time 
of day as critical mitigation efforts can be 
delayed during weekend/holiday periods. 
Having clear on\-call duty assignments for 
off\-hours security incidents is crucial.

 Evaluate Managed Security Services 
Provider Options: If your security 
organization has staffing or skills shortages, 
establish pre\-agreed response procedures 
with your MSPs so they can take immediate 
action following an agreed\-upon plan.

 Conduct Periodic Table\-Top Exercises: 
These cross\-functional drills should 
include key decision\-makers from Legal, 
Human Resources, IT Support, and other 
departments all the way up to the executive 
team for smooth incident response.

 Ensure Clear Isolation Practices: This can 
stop further ingress into the network or 
the spread of ransomware to other devices 
or systems. Teams should be proficient 
at disconnecting a host, locking down a 
compromised account, blocking a malicious 
domain, etc. Testing these procedures 
with scheduled or unscheduled drills at 
least once every quarter is recommended 
to ensure all personnel and procedures 
perform as expected.

 Lock Down Critical Accounts for Weekend 
and Holiday Periods: The usual path 
attackers take in propagating ransomware 
across a network is to escalate privileges 
to domain\-level admin and then deploy 
the ransomware. Those highest privilege 
accounts, in many cases, are rarely 
required to be in use during the weekend 
or holiday breaks. Teams should create 
highly\-secured, emergency\-only accounts 
in the Active Directory that are only used 
when other operational accounts are 
temporarily disabled as a precaution or 
inaccessible during a ransomware attack. 
Also, take similar precautions with VPN 
access in limiting its availability during the 
weekend depending on business needs.

Holiday ransomware threats, refer to our 
other 2021 study, Organizations at Risk: 
Ransomware Attackers Don’t Take Holidays.
