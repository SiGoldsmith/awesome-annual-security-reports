Achieving Security Resilience

### Foreword
When you think of the word resilience, what comes to mind?
I bet you’re thinking of someone or something who has suffered (to
quote the Great Bard) the “slings and arrows of outrageous fortune”
but has the fortitude and audacity to become even stronger.
That’s a perfectly acceptable definition and I applaud the spirit of it.
But when you are talking about securing companies large and small,
merely being resilient enough to bounce back after being down may
not be good enough. After all, successful cybersecurity breaches like
ransomware or intellectual property theft can do outsized harm to
companies, their employees, partners, and even their customers. In
the 2021 Security Outcomes Report, 41 percent of the companies we
surveyed said that they suffered a major security incident or loss within
the last two years, showing how wide this problem has become.
Cisco defines security resilience as being able to protect the
integrity of every aspect of your business so it can withstand,
not just survive, unpredictable threats or changes and emerge
stronger. As you will learn in this third volume of our Security
Outcomes Report, there is near unanimous agreement among
the executives we surveyed that achieving security resilience is
critical to their business. And it’s no wonder as more businesses
are interconnected today, a breach on anyone in the value chain
can have a dramatic ripple effect on the others. No executive
wants to be known as the one not having done enough.
So, please use and enjoy this report. I hope you find it useful
in developing your strategies and solutions for achieving your
measure of security resilience. Resilient to threats. Resilient to
change. Resilient to the unknown. The security industry is certainly
not lacking in buzzwords. However, I have a feeling that the word
resilient is going to stick around for a while. Maybe not as long
as a great Shakespeare play like Hamlet but long enough.

Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3
Achieving Security Resilience

### Introduction
Security is never an easy job. But the past few years
have really upped the ante when it comes to protecting
a business from cyber incidents. Today’s security
defenders not only have to consider increasing threats
and an expanding attack surface, but also bigger picture
risks such as warfare, climate change, financial instability,
and of course, a global pandemic.
In this tumultuous environment, the concept of resilience
has risen to the top of most corporate agendas. How
can a company quickly adapt to these rapid, disruptive
changes and emerge stronger?
In this third volume of the Security Outcomes Report,
we break security resilience down into digestible and
actionable insights. (Because we’re sure you have
enough on your plate without having to crack the code
to resilience on your own.) No one report can cover all
there is to know about such a colossal subject matter;
but we’ve surfaced some highlights for you to consider
when building and refining your cybersecurity strategy for
the road ahead.
Using the data gathered from over 4,700 security
professionals across 26 countries, we uncovered seven
success factors that can boost cyber resilience. The
report also analyzes exactly what security resilience
means, why it’s important, and how businesses are
ranking their own resilience.
We hope this data serves as a resource and provides you
with more confidence as you set your organization up to
thrive no matter what comes next.
Between risk and resilience, there’s a bridge. We know
the journey can be arduous at times, and we’re here to help.

### Key findings
**Security resilience is top of mind among executives;**
**96%** of them consider it highly important to their business.

**Nearly 2/3** of organizations report experiencing major security incidents that jeopardized business operations.

**About the survey**

**Sampling method**
Cisco contracted a professional survey research firm to field a fully anonymous survey in mid-2022 that utilized a stratified random sampling technique.

**Survey participants**
We surveyed 4,751 active information security and privacy professionals from 26 countries. Sample demographics can be found in the appendix.

**Data analysis**
The Cyentia Institute conducted an independent analysis of the survey data on behalf of Cisco, and generated all results presented in this report.

**Preventing incidents and mitigating losses are the top two priorities for security resilience overall.**

**Retaining security talent ranks as the lowest resilience priority, but is also the most challenging for organizations of all types.**

**TOP PRIORITIES**

**LOWEST PRIORITY**

**Architecture matters.** Organizations with mature zero trust, XDR and SASE implementations all boast significantly higher resilience scores.

**Culture matters.** Organizations that foster a culture of security see a 46% increase in resilience.

**We identified 7 success factors that, if achieved, boost our measure of overall security resilience from the bottom 10th percentile to the top 10th percentile.**

Whether or not you consider “resilience” to be a buzzword, it’s undeniable that it’s on the mind — and probably on the lips — of many inside and outside the field of cybersecurity. But what exactly does it mean? We at Cisco certainly have some thoughts on that topic, but since this is a survey of 4,700+ security practitioners, we’ll hand them the mic instead.

### What is security resilience?
When asked to describe what security (or cyber) resilience means in the context of their organization, respondents gave a wide range of answers. Yet we do see some common themes among them.

Words such as “withstand,” “recover,” “anticipate,” “adapt,” and “adverse” all stand out as core to the concept of security resilience in the minds of respondents. If that sounds oddly familiar, it may be because it’s near verbatim from NIST’s definition of cyber resilience. That’s perfectly fine; there’s no such thing as cheating on a survey like this. But it does suggest that the meaning of resilience is murky enough that many security professionals had to look it up. We’ll endeavor to make that concept clearer in the sections that follow.

> **Cyber resilience:**
> The ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources.

Achieving Security Resilience

Contrarians among us may read this section title and think, “I’m not convinced that it is a big deal.” Fair enough. Since we’re not in the business of making empty claims, we’ll back that up right at the start. We asked respondents about the level of interest and importance top executives at their organization place on security resilience. The message couldn’t be clearer. A full 96% of executives consider security resilience highly important. We think that warrants Really Big Deal status. Perhaps the high priority placed on security resilience among executives stems from the fact that so many are very well acquainted with the risks. Nearly two-thirds of respondents reported suffering major security incidents that jeopardized business operations. What’s more, the majority of these events are said to have occurred within the last two years. From this, we infer that security resilience is not just a big deal in the mouths of thought leaders or the minds of executives. It’s a concept that’s critically important to a majority of organizations around the world.

### Why is security resilience a big deal?

**Figure 1:** *A pie chart illustrating the level of interest and importance executives place on security resilience. 96% is labeled "Highly Important" and 4% is labeled "Not Highly Important".*

**Figure 2:** *A pie chart showing whether organizations have experienced a security incident that impacted resilience. 62% is labeled "Yes" and 38% is labeled "No".*

We then asked respondents to elaborate on the types of resilience-impacting incidents they experienced. As seen in Figure 3, network/data breaches and network/system outages were both cited by over half of participants that reported prior incidents. Ransomware and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks were the next most common event types, each affecting about 46% of organizations.

While some of the aforementioned incident types almost certainly involved employees as a vector of attack (e.g., clicking on a phishing email), overt, malicious abuse by insiders was reported by about 38% of organizations. Acts of physical destruction and sabotage were also cited, though substantially less often than the other incident types.

**Figure 3:** *A bar chart showing the types of security incidents that impacted resilience. The x-axis lists the incident types: Network/Data Breaches, Network/System Outages, Ransomware, DDoS Attacks, Insider Abuse, Physical Destruction/Sabotage. The y-axis shows the percentage of organizations affected. Network/Data Breaches and Network/System Outages are both above 50%, Ransomware and DDoS Attacks are around 46%, Insider Abuse is around 38%, and Physical Destruction/Sabotage is below 10%.*

Respondents also had a lot to say about how these events impacted their organizations (see Figure 4). Over 60% referenced IT and communications disruptions, as well as the critical role ICT plays in security resilience. Supply chain disruptions landed in the #2 spot for business-level impacts. We’ve all been living with that pain lately, so it’s no surprise that organizations are feeling it too.

While impacts to supply chain operations affect entities outside the victim organization, impaired internal operations (reported by roughly 41% of firms) wreak havoc on the inside. Brand damage sits at or near the top of the “what keeps you up at night” list of many executives, so it’s telling that roughly 40% of these incidents result in that outcome. Loss of competitive advantage is another top concern, and it rounds out the top five resilience impacts.

**Figure 4:** *A bar chart showing the types of resilience impacts caused by security incidents. The x-axis lists the impact types: IT/Communications Disruptions, Supply Chain Disruptions, Impaired Internal Operations, Brand Damage, Loss of Competitive Advantage, Loss of Customer Trust, Financial Losses, Legal/Regulatory Penalties, Other. The y-axis shows the percentage of organizations affected. IT/Communications Disruptions is above 60%, Supply Chain Disruptions is around 50%, Impaired Internal Operations, Brand Damage, and Loss of Competitive Advantage are around 40%, Loss of Customer Trust is around 30%, Financial Losses is around 25%, Legal/Regulatory Penalties is below 20%, and Other is below 10%.*

What can organizations do to avoid such events and improve security resilience? Well, that’s one of the main questions we’re seeking to answer in this report. Right at the outset, it’s clear they’re doing one thing above all others — spending money. An astounding 96% of participants say their organizations have increased investments in security in the wake of their most recent major incident.

Now, we all know throwing money at a problem doesn’t solve it. But we also know few solutions are free. The important question is which investments give a return and which do not. We’ll share what we learned about that a bit later. Before we do, though, let’s explore the primary objectives that fall under the umbrella of security resilience.

> “Security, after all, is a risk business. We don’t secure everything, everywhere, or otherwise business wouldn’t get done. But security resilience will allow you to focus your security resources on the pieces of the business that add the most value to an organization, and ensure that value is protected.”
> — Helen Patton, CISO, Cisco Security Business Group

From the last section, we know that security resilience is a big deal among the big bosses, but what does it actually entail? What traits or achievements indicate that an organization is resilient? In preparation for this survey, we asked a group of security leaders about their goals and objectives for security resilience. We then reviewed their responses and grouped them into nine main security resilience outcomes.

Returning to our present global survey, we asked participants which of those nine key resilience outcomes their organizations considered to be the most important (they could select up to three). Figure 5 tallies their responses.

We find it somewhat surprising that preventing incidents is the top selection, given that general consensus seems to place resilience as a “right of boom” concept. But in combination with mitigating financial losses, the top two picks target the classic definition of risk — probability and impact.

Next up, adapting to unexpected events calls back to themes depicted in the free-form responses shared earlier. We can’t help wondering if recent experience with the COVID-19 pandemic pushed that one up the list.

We’ll refrain from commenting on all nine outcomes and instead skip down to the last one. Recruiting and retaining security talent was only seen as a primary aspect of security resilience by 3.8% of respondents. Perhaps respondents see talent retention as HR’s responsibility or a long-term objective rather than critical to a resilience-impacting event. But ample and trained security staff are a critical success factor for resilient organizations, as we’ll elaborate on later.

### What does security resilience entail?

**Figure 5:** *A bar chart showing the most important security resilience outcomes as selected by participants. The x-axis lists the outcomes: Preventing Incidents, Mitigating Losses, Adapting to Change, Keeping up with the Business, Capability Maturity, Containing Incidents, Business Continuity, Cost-Effective Security, Talent Retention. The y-axis shows the percentage of respondents selecting each outcome. Preventing Incidents is the highest at around 60%, Mitigating Losses is just below 60%, Adapting to Change is around 40%, Keeping up with the Business is around 30%, Capability Maturity is around 25%, Containing Incidents is around 20%, Business Continuity is around 15%, Cost-Effective Security is around 10%, and Talent Retention is below 5%.*

As you might imagine, experience shapes one’s perception of what security resilience entails. Recall earlier when we said that 62% of respondents experienced a resilience-impacting security incident. According to Figure 6, those events may have triggered a reordering of priorities.

13
Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3
Achieving Security Resilience

**Figure 6:** *A bar chart comparing the ranking of perceived importance of security resilience outcomes for organizations with no prior incidents versus with prior incidents. The x-axis lists the outcomes: Preventing Incidents, Mitigating Losses, Adapting to Change, Keeping up with the Business, Capability Maturity, Containing Incidents, Business Continuity, Cost-Effective Security, Talent Retention. There are two bars for each outcome, one for organizations with no prior incidents and one for organizations with prior incidents. The bars are ranked based on the importance given by each group. For organizations with no prior incidents, the ranking from most to least important is: Preventing Incidents, Capability Maturity, Keeping up with the Business, Mitigating Losses, Adapting to Change, Containing Incidents, Business Continuity, Cost-Effective Security, and Talent Retention. For organizations with prior incidents, the ranking from most to least important is: Mitigating Losses, Adapting to Change, Keeping up with the Business, Preventing Incidents, Containing Incidents, Business Continuity, Capability Maturity, Cost-Effective Security, and Talent Retention.*

Mitigating losses moves from #4 among organizations without major incidents to #1 for those who’ve lived through them. Adapting to change events and keeping up with the business bump up as well. Preventing incidents and capability maturity take a backseat.

You may also be wondering if perceptions of security resilience differ based on demographic and firmographic characteristics. Here again the data answers in the affirmative. We’ll use the respondent’s role as the filter for this one to compare CISOs and Security Directors with security professionals in technical roles.

Differences in opinion emerge right from the start. Security leaders prioritize mitigating financial losses, containing the spread and scope of events, and not hindering the business. More technical and operational security respondents rank those 2nd, 5th, and 6th, respectively and place the highest importance on preventing major incidents. That’s not to say either group is right or wrong; it’s natural that they focus on different aspects of security resilience. But it’s probably a good idea to establish shared priorities and delineate responsibilities to ensure everyone works as a team to achieve better outcomes.

**Figure 7:** *A bar chart comparing the ranking of perceived importance of security resilience outcomes by work role. The x-axis lists the outcomes: Preventing Incidents, Mitigating Losses, Adapting to Change, Keeping up with the Business, Capability Maturity, Containing Incidents, Business Continuity, Cost-Effective Security, Talent Retention. There are two bars for each outcome, one for CISOs/Security Directors and one for Technical Security Professionals. The bars are ranked based on the importance given by each group. For CISOs/Security Directors, the ranking from most to least important is: Mitigating Losses, Containing Incidents, Keeping up with the Business, Adapting to Change, Preventing Incidents, Business Continuity, Capability Maturity, Cost-Effective Security, and Talent Retention. For Technical Security Professionals, the ranking from most to least important is: Preventing Incidents, Mitigating Losses, Adapting to Change, Capability Maturity, Containing Incidents, Keeping up with the Business, Business Continuity, Cost-Effective Security, and Talent Retention.*

> “We have the tired, deprecated notion of building systems that have five nines for their ability to stay up. When we’re talking about security resilience, it’s more towards building [systems] to fail in that, if a system goes down, it will continue to operate despite having any technical issues.”
> — Dave Lewis, Advisory CISO, Cisco Secure

We asked respondents how confident they were that their organization would remain resilient through a worst-case (but still plausible) cyber event if it occurred today. A little over a third expressed strong confidence, with the remaining two-thirds expressing some level of doubt about how their organizations would fare.

Asking a subjective question like that is an interesting gut check on the state of security resilience, but we’ll need to be more specific and measured if we want to accomplish our goals. Since we have input from respondents on a set of desired security resilience outcomes, let’s see where organizations stand in terms of achieving those outcomes. We asked respondents to rate their organization’s performance for each objective using a four-point scale (failing | struggling | performing | excelling). To help them do that more objectively, we provided a description of each outcome along with example evidences of what failure and/or excellence might look like. These descriptions and examples are included in Appendix B for those curious about the details or interested in adapting these for use within your own organization.

### The state of security resilience

**Figure 8:** *A pie chart showing the confidence in ability to remain resilient through a worst-case cyber event. 36% is labeled "Strongly Confident" and 64% is labeled "Not Strongly Confident".*

Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3
Achieving Security Resilience

In general, the majority of respondents gave their organizations at least a “performing” rating overall. But don’t take that to mean all is hunky dory in the world of security resilience. As seen in Figure 9, almost half of the survey participants say their organizations are struggling or outright failing to achieve at least one of the nine security resilience outcomes. Over a quarter are having difficulty with two or more, 10% report at least four outcomes giving them trouble, and so on. From that, we conclude that there are a lot of organizations out there underachieving in key areas of security resilience.

**Figure 9:** *A bar chart showing the proportion of organizations struggling with security resilience outcomes. The x-axis lists the number of outcomes the organizations are struggling with: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The y-axis shows the percentage of organizations struggling with that many outcomes. The percentage decreases as the number of outcomes increases.*

Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3
Achieving Security Resilience

We saw earlier that perceptions vary on the relative importance of these security resilience outcomes, so it’s no real shock to learn that performance varies as well for different types of organizations. Take Figure 10, for example, where we compare the proportion of participants struggling with each outcome across different organization sizes. Firms of all sizes agree that recruiting and retaining security staff is the biggest challenge, but the consensus ends there.

We find this view particularly interesting because it gives the sense that areas of struggle change as organizations grow. For instance, mitigating financial losses is purportedly least challenging for the smallest firms. (Maybe because they’re more worried about going out of business than losing money?) But it creeps successively up into the top three for organizations with 1,000–9,999 employees. And then it crashes back to last place for the largest enterprises. (Maybe because they have extra financial security from high revenues?)

On the other hand, some things seem to never change with growth. As mentioned above, organizations of all sizes apparently struggle more to recruit and retain security talent than with any other outcome. That’s rather ironic since they also unanimously rate that outcome as the lowest priority for security resilience. A self-fulfilling prophecy, perhaps? Or maybe just blunt pragmatism. (“Sure, it’s hard to keep good people, but I’m far more concerned about avoiding major incidents and losses.”)

**Figure 10:** *A bar chart showing the most challenging security resilience outcomes ranked by organization size. The x-axis lists the outcomes: Preventing Incidents, Mitigating Losses, Adapting to Change, Keeping up with the Business, Capability Maturity, Containing Incidents, Business Continuity, Cost-Effective Security, Talent Retention. There are four bars for each outcome, one for organizations with less than 100 employees, one for organizations with 100-999 employees, one for organizations with 1000-9999 employees, and one for organizations with 10,000+ employees. The bars are ranked based on the level of challenge reported by each size group. For organizations with less than 100 employees, the ranking from most to least challenging is: Talent Retention, Capability Maturity, Keeping up with the Business, Adapting to Change, Preventing Incidents, Business Continuity, Containing Incidents, Cost-Effective Security, and Mitigating Losses. For organizations with 100-999 employees, the ranking from most to least challenging is: Talent Retention, Capability Maturity, Keeping up with the Business, Adapting to Change, Preventing Incidents, Containing Incidents, Business Continuity, Mitigating Losses, and Cost-Effective Security. For organizations with 1000-9999 employees, the ranking from most to least challenging is: Talent Retention, Capability Maturity, Keeping up with the Business, Mitigating Losses, Adapting to Change, Preventing Incidents, Containing Incidents, Business Continuity, and Cost-Effective Security. For organizations with 10,000+ employees, the ranking from most to least challenging is: Talent Retention, Capability Maturity, Keeping up with the Business, Adapting to Change, Preventing Incidents, Business Continuity, Containing Incidents, Cost-Effective Security, and Mitigating Losses.*

**Measuring the overall security resilience score**

In addition to assessing each outcome, we wanted an aggregate score that captured an organization’s level of achievement across all nine outcomes as a measure of its overall security resilience. We refer to that as the ‘security resilience score,’ and you’ll see it referenced a lot in this report.

To get the score, we used a statistics technique called Item Response Theory. (We did the same thing for the security outcomes score in the last volume.) This technique enables us to score organizations based on how they’re doing across all outcomes, while at the same time accounting for the fact that some outcomes might be harder to achieve than others. This tried-and-true technique is how standardized test scores are created. The absolute value of the score has no particular meaning, but it does provide a reliable point of comparison among programs. The distribution of security resilience scores is shown in Figure 11, with the average falling right at 500.

In addition to assessing performance for individual outcomes, we wanted an overall measure of security resilience for each participating organization. So we created a security resilience score based on each organization’s achievement across all nine outcomes. If you’d like to know how we did that, check out the callout below. But the gist is that a higher score means higher performance across greater numbers of security resilience outcomes. We will use this score extensively in the next section to measure the efficacy of various success factors in improving security resilience.

**Figure 11:** *A histogram showing the distribution of security resilience scores across participants. The x-axis shows the security resilience score, and the y-axis shows the number of participants with that score. The distribution is roughly bell-shaped, with the average falling around 500.*

Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3
Achieving Security Resilience

We come now to the part for which you’ve all been waiting/reading. With a score representing overall security resilience across nine outcomes for each of the 4,700+ organizations, we now explore how to improve it. We approached that by analyzing a bunch of potential organizational, IT, and security factors to test how they correlate with stronger security resilience. Through that process, we identified seven data-backed success factors for security resilience. How much difference did they make? Glad you asked. Organizations that exhibit these factors scored within the top 10% of all security resilience scores measured across all participants in our report. On the other hand, organizations missing the majority of them fall to the bottom 10th percentile. Nobody wants that benchmark.

### Seven success factors for resilience

**Figure 12:** *A bar chart showing the effect of adherence to seven success factors on overall security resilience score. There are two bars, one for organizations in the bottom 10th percentile and one for organizations in the top 10th percentile. The bar for organizations in the bottom 10th percentile is much shorter than the bar for organizations in the top 10th percentile.*

So what are these lucky seven factors for strengthening security resilience, and how can your organization benefit from them? Be forewarned — there’s really no luck about it! Like Denzel Washington once said, “Luck is when an opportunity comes along and you’re prepared for it.” The remainder of this section should help with that preparation.

### 1. Establish executive support

**Figure 13:** *A bar chart showing the effect of executive support on security resilience. There are two bars, one for organizations with poor executive support and one for organizations with strong executive support. The bar for organizations with strong executive support is significantly higher than the bar for organizations with poor executive support.*

Granted, this factor is rather hackneyed in cybersecurity circles, but its effect cannot be dismissed offhand. Organizations that report poor support from top executives exhibit security resilience scores that are 39% lower than those with strong backing from the C-suite. The real puzzle, of course, is how to garner the support of executives.

Our data suggests that security programs that are tightly aligned with the core mission of the business have stronger executive-level support and improved resilience to boot (+32% to overall score). Thus, bridges to the C-suite are built upon a solid understanding of how the business works and how security initiatives can make it work even better. Support goes both ways in any relationship, after all.

While on the topic of relationships, we’ll mention another observation from our analysis. We asked respondents where the responsibility for security resilience sits in their org chart. And for the most part, reporting lines don’t seem to make a big difference. But we did notice that organizations in which the CEO, CRO (Chief Risk Officer), and CISO were closely involved had significantly higher security resilience scores than those where the buck stopped with other C-level executives (e.g., CIO, COO, CTO, CFO).

> “CISOs must strengthen relationships with the executive team. By improving business alignment and getting executive buy-in for budget and headcount, organizations can improve their security resilience. Good relationships lead to good security programs, and good programs lead to great relationships.”
> — Wolfgang Goerlich, Advisory CISO, Cisco

### 2. Cultivate a culture of security
Leaders looking to improve security resilience might start at the top by establishing executive support, but they shouldn’t stop there. They should endeavor to cultivate a culture of security throughout the organization, because our data shows that organizations able to do that will see a 46% boost in resilience scores over those with poor security culture.

**±46%** difference in average resilience scores between organizations with poor versus excellent security culture

That is, of course, much easier said than done. And it’s a fair question to ask what is meant by a strong security culture and how that was assessed in our report. We provided the following guidance to respondents to help them assess and rate the strength of their organization’s security culture:

> In a strong security culture, employees are treated as part of the solution rather than the problem. Security staff understand their role in the context of the organization and non-security staff know they have a role to play too. This may be seen by regularly reporting phishing attempts, potential malware, and other incidents. Security isn’t a negative theme in employee satisfaction surveys or exit interviews. Conversely, frequent security policy violations and workarounds are evidence of poor security culture.

That’s not intended to be an exhaustive description of what a strong security culture looks like because it will look different in every organization. But it at least level sets what respondents had in mind when they rated the strength of their security culture, and hopefully sparks ideas for measuring your own.

Reading between the lines of that description, you may get the sense that it’s important for a security program to clearly communicate its policies and rationale with the rest of the organization. Respondents giving their organizations high marks on that front showed a 27% increase in security resilience scores over those who said their security programs can’t articulate what they’re doing and why they’re doing it. It’s hard to build a strong culture when everyone’s using a different set of blueprints.

Simple training is being seen as a tick-box compliance exercise while communicating and changing the values of the organization is now seen as a core objective by many CISOs.”
> — Richard Archdeacon, Advisory CISO, Cisco

### 3. Hold resources in reserve
We saw earlier that recruiting and retaining talented security personnel was widely perceived as the least critical security resilience outcome, and yet also the most challenging. Prior volumes of the Security Outcomes Report have pointed to several measurable benefits tied to the people pillar of cybersecurity programs, and this one is no different.

Surprisingly, we did not find a strong correlation between the overall size of security staff and level of security resilience, even when controlling for total number of employees in the organization. What does appear to make a difference, though, is maintaining excess internal staff and resources in order to better respond to unexpected cyber events. Organizations able to do that achieve 15% higher security resilience scores on average than those without “flex” resources to tap into when needed.

How exactly do organizations maintain excess internal resources when it’s already difficult to hire and retain baseline security staffing? Unfortunately, we didn’t ask for those details in the survey but it’s now on the list for future research.

If maintaining excess internal staff to handle unexpected events isn’t feasible for your organization, all is not lost. Our analysis also points to an 11% average improvement in security resilience among firms that retain external incident response (IR) services. Consider getting those retainer contracts in place with a credible IR service provider so help is just a phone call away.

You may be thinking that if extra internal resources or external IR services each offer benefits, then perhaps they’re even better together. That indeed appears to be the case. Having both internal and external resources ready to go in a major cyber event gives another 13% bump to security resilience scores over having just one or the other.

Achieving Security Resilience

### 4. Simplify hybrid cloud environments
Cloud architecture and migration have been big topics for quite some time now among IT and security teams alike. Many have gone all-in on the cloud from infrastructure to software, while some remain staunchly entrenched in their on-premises environment. But which of those strategies is more conducive to security resilience? Would you believe that the answer is both?

We asked participants if, in general, their IT infrastructure was hosted on-premises or in the cloud (or varying levels of hybrid models). Then we correlated those answers with each organization’s security resilience score. Cloud-heavy organizations averaged 526, while those predominately on-premises averaged 525. In other words, we see no difference in security resilience outcomes between heavy on-premises versus heavy cloud environments.

Where we do see a difference is in-between on-premises and cloud environments. Organizations in an early-stage hybrid model post security resilience scores that fall an average of 14% lower than their predominately on-premises peers. In the voice of Ned Ryerson from Groundhog Day, “Watch out for that first step [to the cloud]; it’s a doozie!”

There is, however, evidence that it’s possible to make that first step into the cloud a little less of a doozie. Organizations that, in a separate question, rated their hybrid environment as easier to manage and secure appear to cushion the negative hit to resilience that typifies the early phases of cloud migration. Their resilience scores dropped by just 8.5% rather than 14%. What’s more, the benefits of simplified management of hybrid environments grow along with greater levels of cloud adoption.

Organizations with more extensive hybrid environments exhibit resilience scores that are statistically on par with the on-premises (or fully cloud) baseline — provided they’re able to simplify management. If not, those resilience gains are
