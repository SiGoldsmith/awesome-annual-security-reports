I don’t have to tell you that the last few years have changed the 
modern workforce in ways we could have only imagined a decade 
ago. Distributed and hybrid forces, ever-connected devices, high 
speed 5G connectivity, and increased critical data access from 
remote locations have spread enterprises worldwide. I also don’t 
need to tell you that 2022 will look very different from 2021 and 
2020. As we all know, in the current moment, we are light years 
beyond what work, collaboration, and productivity looked like 
before and leading up to the end of 2019. 

For decades, IT and security teams built on-premise 
infrastructure to support the on-site employees, with a fringe few 
moving beyond the office walls. Security and services were 
implemented to build a digital fortress of layers to keep 
employees, endpoints, and data secure. But legacy off-site 
services like VPNs were not designed to handle this influx of 
external connections back to corporate. Once most employees 
moved beyond the physical and digital protections, and once 
locally-installed productivity tools moved to software as a service 
(SaaS) models, security organizations began investing in 
advanced security controls for the endpoints and infrastructure 
they supported. 

Thankfully, the motivation and mindset to enable secure, remote 
collaboration had been set in motion for many enterprises even 
before COVID-19 came along, as global businesses pursued 
mobility, remote access, zero trust, and productivity initiatives. 
Enterprises began investing in cloud-based services and 
applications, moving data from on-site storage servers to scalable 
solutions around the globe. Because some foundation was then 
set, the global pandemic acted more as validation and as a 
catalyst than as a disruptor to their businesses. In that context, 
flexibility, scalability, and accessibility were primary and crucial 
requirements for these new investments. But what about 
security?

Despite their best efforts, the reality is that the workplace evolved 
much faster than many of these teams and strategies had 
planned for. During the last two years specifically, many 
organizations sacrificed security controls in order to 
support productivity and ensure business continuity.

As enterprises evolve, they also introduce more applications 
connected to critical data systems to better support their now-
global workforce, which means these new risks move beyond the 
mobile device itself. The enterprise attack surface grows with 
each new application adopted and deployed in the spirit of 
productivity. After all, each of these applications introduces 
unique sets of risks to an environment, from misconfigured code 
and exposed APIs to leaky cloud connections uncovering 
customer data.

> 10% of the applications installed on the average BYO 
mobile endpoint are enterprise-focused, from multi-
factor authentication (MFA), data access tools, and 
communications.

Now more than ever, both managed and unmanaged devices 
connect to corporate data through unknown and unmanaged 
networks. Necessarily, security teams need to approach every 
endpoint with a brand new mindset. It all begins with visibility into 
all devices connected to corporate systems, whether managed or 
unmanaged. Otherwise, security teams are left blind to the threats 
and risks introduced every day without data attribution and device 
attestation. Organizations need to move beyond mobile device 
and application management toolsets and address the more 
significant security challenges that mobile devices introduce. 

> 66% of organizations surveyed recently have 
active BYOD programs in place, with 11% looking 
to implement the policy over the next year. 

It must also be said that IT and security organizations have 
always invested heavily in endpoint security but have historically 
underestimated the potential impacts of the blurred line between 
mobile and traditional endpoints.

## 1.1: Mobile Security At This Moment In Time
Shridhar Mittal, CEO, Zimperium

For all of these reasons, and specifically at this moment in time and history, we wanted to 
provide greater insight into the role that mobile threats to devices and applications are 
playing in the overall cybersecurity threat landscape.

Our 2022 Global Mobile Threat Report aims to collect, organize, arrange and provide 
insight that empowers global enterprises and organizations to take well-informed and 
decisive action to secure their data. We have mined our data to derive meaning from a 
variety of perspectives, including soliciting those outside of our organization, to enable you 
to see the mobile threat landscape from a multitude of angles. 

First, we take a look at the mobile attack surface, examining a year’s worth of 
mobile threat data in review, including deeper concentration on mobile device 
threat and mobile application threat trends, specifically.

Next, we explore how mobile threats and a modern mobile security strategy 
drive impact throughout the entire security ecosystem, with contributions from 
our ecosystem of partners including SentinelOne, Ping Identity, and Intertrust.

We then provide a roundup and topical analysis of mobile threat data from the 
field, including prominent mobile attack vectors, regional analyses, exploited 
mobile vulnerabilities, mobile phishing trends, and mobile malware trends.

It is our most sincere hope that this information and these perspectives will directly inform your organization’s strategy and investments 
in the coming year as we all do our part to support a more secure and increasingly connected world. 

### How We Hope You'll Use This Year's Report

The world during the global pandemic was sustained significantly by mobile connectivity, enabling a huge swath of businesses to remain 
afloat. From global enterprises powered by knowledge workers accessing corporate data from their personal devices, to small restaurants 
relying upon menu QR codes, online orders, and contactless payments, mobile connectivity enabled the world to remain connected in a 
time of necessary isolation. And there is no “putting this rabbit back” into the proverbial hat. This level of mobile connectivity will remain the 
expectation for workers, customers, constituents, users, and enterprises for decades to come. It is now time to come to terms with how we 
must effectively secure those connections in order to continue to enable them.

## 1.2: Mobile Security and the Broader Enterprise Security Strategy
Jon Paterson, CTO, Zimperium

The inclusion of modern and mobile endpoint and application security into 
enterprise mindsets is not the final frontier but the beginning of what is to come. 
The integration of devices into our every day is paving the way for the convergence of the modern endpoint. Apple has already started to 
integrate OSX and iOS services across their platforms, and Windows 11 is soon introducing the ability to run Android applications on the 
desktop natively. Google’s ChromeOS project further blurs the line between desktop and mobile endpoints with shared applications, 
extensions, and services.

When we consider developing applications for the modern endpoint, building secure and compliant applications begins with choosing the 
right architecture and framework for devices and platforms that support your business needs. Security by design allows for good 
foundational decisions around code, data, and cryptographic key protection. Security measures will need to account for hardware and 
software fragmentation. As data stewards, enterprises must assume that applications will, and do, operate in hostile 
environments, making run-time visibility and protection of data at rest, use and transit a priority.

Over the last few years, security toolsets surrounding XDR and SOAR have risen to drive the traditional security evolution against the 
advancing threats. Identity and access management tools have expanded to support remote access at scale, and 36% of enterprises we 
surveyed are prioritizing the investment of zero trust architectures over the next year.  These advanced layers of security enable
enterprises to scale beyond the corporate walls effectively, integrate into effect identity management workflows, and establish a perimeter 
of one around the devices and applications connected through the myriad of networks.

But all of this security investment crumbles without mobile inclusion. From modern and mobile endpoint defense and device attestation, to 
securing enterprise applications through the complete development lifecycle, enterprises need their security to scale with their data, 
access, employees, and customers.

Enterprises that get ahead of establishing zero trust architectures and 
applying security mindsets to application development will be ready for 
this coming evolution of the modern endpoint. Threats and risks will be 
capable of jumping across devices just like legitimate data and services, 
and vulnerabilities to critical systems will be shared. As recently as 
September 2021, the first inclination of a multi-device, single 
vulnerability (CVE-2021-30860) was revealed as part of the Pegasus 
spyware attack, impacting iMessage on iOS and OSX devices.

And this is just the beginning. The line between the mobile and traditional endpoint will continue to blur, and with it, the security 
mindsets will need to be in place and ready to provide visibility, attest and secure access to enterprises from our modern endpoint 
devices. 

> Multi-experience platforms will continue to transform how 
applications are designed and built but will exponentially 
increase the need for comprehensive and integrated security 
platforms.

The enterprise attack surface will also continue to change and 
evolve, driven by the challenge and opportunity that the 
growing attack surfaces present. From state-sponsored 
techniques, application exploits, and commercially available 
threats, the business of cybercrime is growing year over year 
and shows no signs of slowing down. The impact on the 
business is not small either, with the cost of a data breach in 
2021 increasing from $3.86 million to $4.24 million.

For over a decade, we have been pushing the boundaries of 
mobile endpoint and application security, working with forward-
thinking partners to stay ahead of the risks and threats to the 
modern workforce. None of us could have predicted the impact 
the last three years had on global business, but Zimperium was 
prepared to scale with the mobile needs of enterprises globally. 
Whether you are looking to understand the risks mobile 
endpoints introduce to your corporate environment, or you are 
exploring threats to your internally developed mobile apps, I 
hope the 2022 Global Mobile Threat Report provides you with 
data and research to direct you towards mobile security 
confidence.

## 1.3: The Continued Role for AI and Machine Learning in Mobile Security
Esteban Pellegrino, Chief Scientist, Zimperium

Late in 2019, an incredible story began to circulate on various scientific-focused news 
sites talking about the power of the iPhone compared to the computers that took NASA 
to the moon. It was an exciting exploration into the history of the computing power of 
one of humankind’s most incredible achievements 50 years prior and how it lined up to 
the little device we slide into our pocket every day. Without getting into the math of it all, 
it’s safe to say the 2019 Apple iPhone 11 would have been more than capable of 
processing the data and powering all six moon landings combined. And with 
processing power to spare.

The capabilities of these mobile devices are often taken for granted by users, looking at the tiny screen that is always connected to a 
network, browsing, exploring, navigating, and computing. Sometimes they are even used to make a call. But the iPhone and Android 
devices that dominate the mobile market today are more computer than phone, connected into critical data systems, packed full of 
private information, and relied upon for daily work and personal life.

15 years ago, the first iPhone launched, and we saw the smartphone begin to make its way into enterprises through managed and 
rudimentary unmanaged programs. These handheld computers evolved from consumer accessories to business tools, keeping 
employees connected with work as they roamed. Access was basic at first, but as the years have gone by, the mobile device has grown 
from accessory to critical access device for services, data, and identity, with equal importance of access to the supplied laptop. But 
unlike the laptop, mobile endpoints and the apps they were running traditionally lacked the advanced security to keep up with the 
context of the current threat landscape.

10 years ago, the team that founded Zimperium recognized this lack of advanced mobile security tools to keep data and access safe. 
We knew we needed to understand the threats beyond human capabilities, to detect patterns impossible to see even for 
experts, and most importantly, to continuously learn from the evolving mobile experience. 

In 2012, we invented and patented [Zimperium z9](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9208323B1/en), the dynamically updatable machine learning framework that transformed Zimperium 
into the first mobile threat defense (MTD) vendor fully powered by on-device artificial intelligence. 
For the past ten years, we’ve been delivering the most advanced security to endpoints and applications globally, keeping ahead of the 
growing threats to the mobile market. Our mission is now to unify the security of applications and endpoints through one single 
technology, minimizing the attack surface of mobile devices and the applications installed within. We aim to provide the most 
advanced, enterprise-ready, on-device zero-day protection to mobile endpoints and applications during development and run-time. 

Mobile and traditional devices are converging, and the mobile versions are increasingly 
replacing their traditional counterparts, capable of accessing and processing high amounts of 
data far from the confines of an office. With each new application's advancement in technology, 
there are unknown risks and threats to overcome. It is time to address them head-on, increase 
mobile security confidence, and be ready for whatever comes next.

Today, our advanced AI provides on-device 
protection from malware, network 
reconnaissance and interception attacks, 
phishing, hooking, tampering, debugging, and 
exploiting mobile devices and applications. 
Endpoints and apps alike are leveraging our AI 
technology to be ready when novel threats 
emerge in the wild, and our experience will 
continue to provide the security needed to stay 
ahead of the threat.

One day, our mobile devices will go to the moon and far beyond, communication devices untethered from the walls but connecting future 
explorers more than ever. Just as the Apollo scientists could not have predicted the computer power of today’s devices, we don't know 
what the next evolution in technology will be, but we can be confident that mobile is here to stay.

## 1.4: Managing Mobile Risk in 2022
Malcolm Harkins, Chief Security & Trust Officer, Epiphany Systems

> But have we truly understood the risks we have taken and the potential impact? In some organizations, 
the answer is clearly yes, but unfortunately, in far too many organizations, the answer is no. 
> “
> This quote from Glynn Breakwell in her book The Psychology of Risk says it all. I have seen, experienced, and helped promote mobile 
computing for decades, dating well back into my days at Intel where I was Chief Security & Privacy Officer. 
> When the first truly mobile laptop with ubiquitous wireless connectivity (Centrino platform) was launched in March 2003, my team and I 
enabled it. When the iPhone launched in 2007, we enabled it – instantly creating 50,000 BYOD devices overnight. When various 
enterprise apps became mobile, we enabled them. In the years since those early days of mobility, there has continued to be an 
explosion of devices and apps, creating new opportunities for economic growth as well as social benefits that have positively impacted 
businesses as well as consumers. 
> For example, one trend mentioned in the report identifies that many have allowed iPhones and mobile devices in their ecosystem. Was 
that a calculated risk worth taking when security wasn’t established for those channels of data access? Or, did the pursuit of the potential 
benefits cause a bias that not only suppressed the real risk to the organization but also created a substantial risk to individuals whose 
personal and financial data is now at risk? 
> Zimperium has created the most comprehensive mobile threat report published to date. It contains a broad view of the threat and 
vulnerability trends as well as the implications they could have on the security of our organizations. The World Economic Forum’s global 
risk report for 2022 states, “growing cyber threats are outpacing society’s ability to effectively prevent and manage them.” The attack 
surface will always grow and change as computing evolves but understanding the attack depth within the context of your enterprise 
infrastructure is the key to understanding how mobile apps and devices could generate a material exposure that could impact your 
business.
> In this report, in-depth details are shared from the Zimperium zLabs advanced threat research team that provide the comprehensive 
insight security teams need to understand the mobile risk landscape. One such trend that will reshape the risk landscape detailed in the 
report is the convergence of systems, blurring of mobile apps/desktop apps into the modern OS. This trend in particular will “surround and 
envelop us,” and without proper mitigations implemented, we will “risk everything.”
> Here’s another of my favorite quotes, this time from Art Turock: 
> Risk surrounds and envelops us. Without understanding it, we risk 
everything, and without capitalizing on it, we gain nothing” 
> There’s a difference between interest and commitment. When you’re 
interested in doing something, you do it when circumstances permit. 
When you’re committed to something, you accept no excuses, only 
results.” 
> “

It’s clear, given the trends, that we have collectively underestimated the mobile risks we have and the 
exposure that has been created. I learned many years ago that there are two types of mistakes. Ones you have to live with and 
ones you can fix. When I have been in the latter position, I have considered myself lucky and fixed it. All our security investments 
crumble without the inclusion of mobile endpoints and apps. We can fix the mobility security mistakes of the past and better position 
ourselves to avoid risk mistakes in the future. 

The choice is yours, and the time is now. If you don’t make a choice to commit to addressing these risks head-on, it should be clear 
from this report that, inevitably, the choice will be made for you.

## 2.1: 2021 Mobile Threats in Review

> 42% Reported mobile devices & web applications led to security incident
> 42% Reported unauthorized apps & resources accessing enterprise data
> 10% Reported unsecured applications due to lack of authentication or encryption
> 56% Rely on at least four to eight enterprise applications on their mobile device
> 17% Depend on more than eight work-specific apps on their mobile device

Mobile devices aren’t just a personal communication accessory— today, they’re an integral 
part of how we get work done in an enterprise. With increased capabilities and connectivity, 
smartphones and tablets can now access the same data and services as traditional devices 
and a wealth of new cloud-based business services. In order to support both the productivity 
of remote workers and the security of corporate assets, mobile endpoints must be proactively 
and intelligently protected. 

While traditional endpoints continue to be leveraged, security teams are challenged to gain 
the visibility they need into mobile device usage and activity. This lack of visibility makes it 
difficult and time-consuming for teams to detect threats and prioritize remediation efforts. 
Further, with each new endpoint that starts accessing enterprise systems, the organization’s 
attack surface expands, thus increasing the risk of nefarious activity. 

In a recent survey, technology leaders were asked to highlight the five threats that had the 
most significant impact on their systems in the previous twelve months. 42% of 
respondents reported that mobile devices and web applications have led to a security 
incident. It is not just mobile endpoints introducing risk into corporate systems: another 42% 
of respondents reported unauthorized apps and resources accessing enterprise data, and 
10% reported unsecured applications due to the lack of authentication or encryption. 
 
It is now more critical (and more challenging than ever) to strike a balance between 
enabling mobile access and minimizing the enterprise’s exposure to attack. Whether a 
business relies on managed, corporate-owned endpoints or has an active bring-your-own-
device (BYOD) program, mobile endpoints and applications introduce increased risks. 56% of 
technology leaders surveyed rely on at least four to eight enterprise applications for 
productivity. 17% of the surveyed technology leaders depend on more than eight work-
specific apps on their mobile device.
 
  Although these applications vary between vendor-
provided services and internally developed toolsets, both categories rely on access to 
corporate data systems for effectiveness.

Attacks on mobile devices and applications had a negative impact on systems, privacy, 
customer data, and more. With these devices processing and accessing critical information 
like passwords, multi-factor authentication apps, and corporate files and communications, it’s 
no surprise that the threats have increased over the last few years—and that malicious actors 
continue to invest more in targeting these devices and applications with increasing levels of 
sophistication.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic arose, 60% of organizations had no BYOD policies in place. 
 Over the last two years, many teams 
have responded heroically and rapidly to support remote workers. But the resulting increase in the introduction of BYOD policies continues 
to blur the lines between devices and data, and between consumer threats and enterprise threats. In addition, it’s important to recognize 
that just like consumers, employees are concerned about their privacy. In fact, trust and privacy concerns among employees continue to 
slow the adoption of device management policies in enterprises. 

As we analyzed the mobile threat landscape, 2021 was the year of big revelations and reboots of previously discovered malware. Pegasus, 
the spyware program sold to governments around the world, reappeared in the news after revelations of a campaign targeting 50,000 
journalists, human rights activists, political leaders, and more. Initially unveiled by Amnesty International, the spyware campaign featured 
zero-day exploits targeting iOS devices. Shockwaves of this discovery have continued for months as additional information about the 
attacks and victims is revealed.

Initially discovered in 2017, the Joker Trojan reappeared in 2021, targeting Android devices with updated capabilities. These trojans are 
malicious Android applications that have been notorious for performing bill fraud and subscribing users to premium services. As with 
previous forms of these attacks, the newly discovered trojans had the same objective: financial gain. Successful infections of mobile 
devices often slide under a victim’s radar until long after the money is gone, leaving them with little to no recourse for recovery. 

From device exploits to application misconfigurations, malware, and leaky databases, the mobile device has become a ripe target for 
malicious actors globally. Zimperium’s 2021 data proves there was no shortage of threats targeting mobile ecosystems. However, with the 
lessons learned from last year, 2022 should be the year people start approaching mobile devices and apps with the same advanced 
security mindset as traditional endpoints.

> Over 1,000 samples of the Joker malware were discovered 
in mid-2021, and these more recent variants had new 
security-bypassing techniques built into their code.

### 2022 Zimperium zLabs Research Highlights

The Zimperium zLabs Advanced Research Group continuously investigates mobile 
device and application threats targeting users worldwide. Compared to prior years, data 
and news coverage of mobile threats increased in 2021, and there was a greater focus on 
iOS and Android attack vectors. In 2021, the Zimperium zLabs team discovered 
numerous threats impacting over 10 million devices in at least 214 countries. 

Here is a summary of the most notable discoveries from the Zimperium zLabs Advanced Threat Research team:

*   **PhoneSpy**
    The Zimperium zLabs team identified 23 applications targeting South Korean 
    citizens to date. This spyware campaign infected thousands of victims’ devices. 
    These malicious Android apps are designed to spy on their victims constantly. They 
    run silently in the background without raising any suspicion. We believe the 
    malicious actors responsible for PhoneSpy have gathered significant amounts of 
    personal and corporate information on their victims, including private 
    communications and photos. After public disclosure, the specific campaign was 
    deactivated, and the command-and-control server was taken down. Infected 
    devices are no longer under the control of the attackers.
*   **GriftHorse**
    Forensic evidence of this active Android Trojan attack, which we named 
    GriftHorse, suggests the threat group has been running this campaign since 
    November 2020. These malicious applications were initially distributed through both 
    Google Play and third-party application stores. The campaign targeted mobile users 
    from more than 70 countries. GriftHorse is exceptionally versatile. The campaign 
    could change the language and content displayed based on the user’s IP address. 
    Between November 2020 and September 2021 (when it was publicly disclosed), 
    GriftHorse infected over 10 million devices. Google removed the malicious 
    applications upon reporting by the Zimperium zLabs team.
*   **FlyTrap**
    Forensic evidence of this active Android Trojan attack, which we dubbed FlyTrap, 
    points to malicious parties operating in Vietnam. This hijacking campaign has been 
    running since March 2021. These malicious applications were initially distributed 
    through both Google Play and third-party application stores. The threat actors take 
    advantage of the fact that users commonly have the misconception that logging into 
    the right domain is always secure, irrespective of the application used. The targeted 
    domains are popular social media platforms, and this campaign has been 
    exceptionally effective in harvesting social media session data of users from 144 
    countries. These compromised accounts can be used as a botnet for different 
    purposes. For example, actors can boost the popularity of specific pages, sites, and 
    products. In addition, these accounts can be utilized to spread misinformation or 
    political propaganda. Once reported by the Zimperium zLabs team, Google 
    removed the malicious applications.
*   **Android System Update**
    The “System Update” app was identified by the Zimperium zLabs team using the z9 
    malware engine, which powers zIPS on-device detection. After an investigation, 
    researchers determined it to be a sophisticated spyware campaign with complex 
    capabilities. The mobile application poses a threat to Android devices by functioning 
    as a remote access trojan (RAT). The application receives and executes commands 
    to collect and exfiltrate a wide range of data and perform a diverse set of malicious 
    actions. Once in control, hackers can record audio and phone calls, take photos, 
    review browser history, access WhatsApp messages, and more.
*   **Unsecured & Misconfigured Cloud Storage**
    Through the Zimperium zLabs team’s analysis, researchers found that 14% of iOS 
    and Android apps distributed globally revealed several significant configuration 
    issues. These apps used cloud storage with unsecured configurations. These 
    misconfiguration issues exposed personally identifiable information (PII), enabled 
    fraud, and exposed IP addresses or internal systems and configurations. 
    Misconfigured applications were found in almost every category.

The image below shows the distribution of apps with unsecured storage issues across various categories.

**Figure 1: Apps with unsecured cloud storage, by category.**
