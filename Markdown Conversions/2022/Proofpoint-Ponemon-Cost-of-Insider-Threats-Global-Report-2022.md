INTRODUCTION

Ponemon Institute is pleased to present the findings of the 2022 Cost of Insider Threats Global Report. 

THIS IS THE FOURTH 
BENCHMARK STUDY CONDUCTED 
WITH THE EXPLICIT PURPOSE 
TO UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIAL 
CONSEQUENCES THAT RESULT 
FROM INSIDER THREATS. 
A SECONDARY FOCUS IS 
TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO HOW 
WELL ORGANIZATIONS ARE 
MITIGATING THESE RISKS. 

The first Cost of Insider Threats: Global study was conducted in 2016 and focused exclusively on companies in 
North America. Since then, the research has expanded to include organizations in Europe, Middle East, Africa 
and Asia\-Pacific with a global headcount of 500 to more than 75,000\. In this year’s study, we interviewed 1,004 
IT and IT security practitioners in 278 organizations that experienced one or more material events caused by an 
insider. A total of 6,803 insider incidents are represented in this research.

In the context of this research, insider threats are defined as:

A careless or negligent 
employee or contractor

A criminal or 
malicious insider

A credential thief

INSIDER THREATS HAVE 
INCREASED IN BOTH FREQUENCY 
AND COST OVER THE PAST TWO 
YEARS. CREDENTIAL THEFTS, 
FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE ALMOST 
DOUBLED IN NUMBER SINCE 2020\.

However, despite insider threats having increased across all three insider threat profiles, 
insider threats caused by careless or negligent employees are the most prevalent.

According to the findings, 56% of incidents experienced by organizations represented 
in this research were due to negligence, and the average annual cost to remediate the 
incident was $6\.6 million. 

Research also showed that the cost of an insider threat varies significantly based on the 
type of incident. This is largely due to the type of activities required following an insider 
threat incident, including monitoring \& surveillance, investigation, escalation, incident 
response, containment, ex\-post analysis and remediation. 

Following are some key statistics on the cost of insider\-related incidents over a 
12\-month period:

THE FOLLOWING ARE 
THE MOST SALIENT FINDINGS 
FROM THIS RESEARCH.

The time to contain an insider incident 
increased from the last study. 

It took an average of 85 days to contain the incident, 
an increase from 77 days in the previous study.

Only 12% of incidents were contained in less than 30 days. 

12% of incidents

≤30 DAYS

Average number of days 
to contain an incident
85 DAYS

34% of incidents 
contained in
≥90 DAYS

The negligent insider is the 
root cause of most incidents. 
A total of 3,807 attacks, or 56%, were caused 
by employee or contractor negligence, costing 
on average $484,931 per incident. This could be 
the result of a variety of factors, including not 
ensuring their devices are secured, not following 
the company’s security policy, or forgetting to 
patch and upgrade. 

Malicious insiders caused 26% 
or 1,749 incidents at an average 
cost per incident of $648,062\. 
Malicious insiders are employees or authorized 
individuals who use their data access for harmful, 
unethical or illegal activities. Because employees 
are increasingly granted access to more information 
to enhance productivity in today’s work\-from\-
anywhere workforce, malicious insiders are harder 
to detect than external attackers or hackers.

About the Study 2021 Cost of Insider Threats Global Report \| 4Credential theft incidents 
have almost doubled 
since the last study. 
At an average of $804,997 per incident, 
credential theft is the costliest to remediate. 
The intent of the credential thief is to steal users’ 
credentials that will grant them access to critical 
data and information. A favorite technique 
for many of these credential thieves is social 
engineering attacks, primarily phishing. A total 
of an average 1,247 incidents or 18% involved 
stolen credentials in this year’s research.

53% (2018\)

60% (2020\)

67% (2022\)

The frequency of companies 
experiencing incidents has 
increased significantly. 
According to the 2022 research, 67 percent 
of companies are experiencing between 21 
and more than 40 incidents per year. This is 
an increase from 60 percent in 2020 and 53 
percent in 2018 of companies having between 
21 and more than 40 incidents.

Business Disruption
23%
Technology
21%

Disruption or downtime and 
investment in technologies 
represent the most significant 
costs when dealing with 
insider threats. 
The two largest costs are the impact of business 
disruption due to diminished employee productivity 
(23 percent of total cost) and technology, which 
includes the amortized value and licensing for 
software and hardware that are deployed in 
response to insider\-related incidents (21 percent).

security incident. 
An average of $184,548 is spent to contain the consequences of an insider threat. The least amount of average 
cost is for escalation $32,228 and monitoring and surveillance $35,080\. Incidents that took less than 30 days to 
contain had the lowest average annual cost of activities at $11\.23 million. In contrast, average annual activity 
costs for incidents that took more than 90 days is $17\.19 million.

$15\.44M

North American companies 
are spending more than the 
average cost on activities 
that deal with insider threats. 
The total average cost of activities to resolve 
insider threats over a 12\-month period is 
$15\.38 million. Companies in North America 
experienced the highest total cost at $17\.53 
million. European companies had the next 
highest cost at $15\.44 million.

$17\.53M

Financial services and services organizations 
have the highest average activity costs. 
The average activity cost for financial services is $21\.25 million and services 
is $18\.65 million. Service organizations represent a wide range of companies 
including accounting, consultancy and professional service firms.

Organizational size affects the 
cost per incident. 
The annual cost of incidents varies according to 
organizational size. Large organizations with a 
headcount of more than 75,000 spent an average of 
$22\.68 million over the past year to resolve insider\-
related incidents. To deal with the consequences of 
an insider incident, smaller\-sized organizations with a 
headcount below 500 spent an average of $8\.13 million.

Interviews with participants in this research revealed the following 
insights into insider threats.
In addition to determining the cost of insider threats for companies in this research, we interviewed participants 
about their experiences with the threat and what they are doing to reduce risks.

Of all the types of insider threat in this research, organizations are most concerned about credential 
theft. Credential thefts have almost doubled since the last study and cost the most to remediate. Fifty\-five 
percent of respondents say they are most concerned about a hacker stealing the valid credentials of an 
employee. Far fewer respondents (21 percent) are concerned about the negligent insider.

Negligent employees and credential thieves are the root causes of most insider incidents. Fifty\-seven 
percent of respondents say the insider incidents involved employee negligence and 51 percent say a malicious 
outsider stole data by compromising insider credentials or accounts.

Vulnerable IoT devices are of greatest risk to data loss. Sixty\-three percent of respondents say they are 
worried about unmanaged IoT devices resulting in the loss of sensitive data. This is followed by the cloud 
(52 percent of respondents) and the network (51 percent of respondents).

Most sensitive data is in employees’ email. Sixty\-five percent of respondents say email is where employees 
store their organizations most sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual 
property (IP) and other critical business information.

Malicious insiders use corporate email to steal sensitive data. Seventy\-four percent of respondents 
say malicious insiders emailed sensitive data to outside parties followed by scanning for open ports and 
vulnerabilities (62 percent of respondents) and accessing sensitive data not associated with the role or function 
(60 percent of respondents).

As the volume and time to contain insider threats increases, advanced technologies such as user 
behavior tools and automation are important to helping reduce insider threats. User behavior\-based 
tools for detecting insider threats are considered essential or very important to reducing insider threats 
(62 percent of respondents). This is followed by automation for the prevention, investigation, escalation, 
containment and remediation of insider incidents (55 percent of respondents) and AI and machine learning to 
prevent, investigate, escalate, contain and remediate insider incidents (54 percent of respondents).

05

signs that your 
organization is 
at risk

01 Employees are not trained to fully understand and apply laws, 

mandates, or regulatory requirements related to their work 
and that affects the organization’s security.

02 Employees are unaware of the steps they should take at all times 
to ensure that the devices they use—both company issued 
and BYOD—are secured at all times.

03 Employees are sending highly confidential data to an unsecured 
location in the cloud, exposing the organization to risk.

04 Employees break your organization’s security policies 

to simplify tasks.

05 Employees expose your organization to risk if they do not keep devices 
and services patched and upgraded to the latest versions at all times.

OUR RESEARCH FOCUSES ON 
ACTUAL INSIDER\-RELATED 
EVENTS OR INCIDENTS THAT 
IMPACT ORGANIZATIONAL COSTS 
OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS. 

Our methods attempt to capture both direct and indirect costs, including, 
but not limited to, the following business threats: 

Theft or loss of mission critical data or intellectual property

Impact of downtime on organizational productivity

 Damages to equipment and other assets

 Cost to detect and remediate systems and core business processes

Legal and regulatory impact, including litigation defense cost

Lost confidence and trust among key stakeholders

 Diminishment of marketplace brand and reputation

This research utilizes an activity\-based costing (ABC) framework. Our fieldwork was 
conducted over a two\-month period concluding in September 2021\. Our final benchmark 
sample consisted of 278 separate organizations. A total of 1,004 interviews were 
conducted with key personnel in these organizations. Activity costs for the present study 
were derived from actual meetings or site visits for all participants conducted under strict 
confidentiality. Targeted organizations were:

 Commercial and public sector organizations

 Locations throughout the following regions: North America, Europe, Middle East 
\& Africa and Asia\-Pacific

 Central IT function with control over on\-premise and/or cloud environment

 Experienced one or more material incidents caused by careless, malicious 
or criminal insiders

In this report, we present an objective framework that measures the full cost impact of 
events or incidents caused by insiders. Following are the three case profiles that were used 
to categorize and analyze insider\-related cost for 278 organizations:

 Careless or negligent employee or contractor

 Criminal insider including employee or contractor malice

Employee/user credential theft (a.k.a. imposter risk)

Our first step in this research was the recruitment of global organizations. The researchers 
utilized diagnostic interviews and activity\-based costing to capture and extrapolate cost 
data. Ponemon Institute executed all phases of this research project, which included the

FIGURE 11\. 

Percentage of insider cost by consequence 
to business organization

Disruption or downtime and technologies represent the most significant costs 
when dealing with insider incidents. Figure 11 reports the percentage of insider cost for 
careless or negligent employees, criminal insiders and credential theft according to seven 
cost categories. The two largest cost categories are the impact of business disruption due 
to diminished employee/user productivity (23 percent of total cost) and technology, which 
includes the amortized value and the licensing for software and hardware that are deployed 
in response to insider\-related incidents (21 percent). 

Process costs include governance and control system activities in response to threats 
and attacks. Overhead includes a wide array of miscellaneous costs incurred to support 
personnel as well as the IT security infrastructure.

The average annual cost per incident for the three types of incidents 

Credential theft continues to be the costliest insider security incident. Table 2 presents the average cost 
per incident, the average number of incidents and the average annualized cost per year. As shown, employee 
or contractor negligence is most frequent. However, the average cost per this type of incident is far less than 
credential theft and malicious insider incidents. 

The cost of criminal insider incidents steadily increased between 2018 and 2020 from $614,192 to $755,761 but 
declined to $648,062 in this year’s research. The average number of credential thefts has increased significantly 
since 2018 and the average cost for remediating these incidents is $804,997 in this year’s research.

THIS STUDY ADDRESSES 
THE CORE PROCESS\-RELATED 
ACTIVITIES THAT DRIVE A 
RANGE OF EXPENDITURES 
AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH 
A COMPANY’S RESPONSE TO 
INSIDER\-RELATED INCIDENTS. 

The seven cost activity centers in our framework are defined as follows:2 

 Monitoring and surveillance: Activities that enable an organization to reasonably 
detect and possibly deter insider incidents or attacks. This includes allocated (overhead) 
costs of certain enabling technologies that enhance mitigation or early detection.

 Investigation: Activities necessary to thoroughly uncover the source, scope, and 
magnitude of one or more incidents. 

 Escalation: Activities taken to raise awareness about actual incidents among key 
stakeholders within the company. The escalation activity also includes the steps taken to 
organize an initial management response.

 Incident response: Activities relating to the formation and engagement of the incident 
response team including the steps taken to formulate a final management response.

 Containment: Activities that focus on stopping or lessening the severity of insider 
incidents or attacks. These include shutting down vulnerable applications and endpoints.

 Ex\-post response: Activities to help the organization minimize potential future 
insider\-related incidents and attacks. It also includes steps taken to communicate with 
key stakeholders both within and outside the company, including the preparation of 
recommendations to minimize potential harm.

 Remediation: Activities associated with repairing and remediating the organization’s 
systems and core business processes. These include the restoration of damaged 
information assets and IT infrastructure.

2 Internal costs are extrapolated using labor (time) as a surrogate for direct and indirect costs. This is also used to allocate an overhead

Average trend in activity cost per incident for 7 activity centers.

Companies spend the most on containment of the insider security incident. As discussed, the average 
time to contain an incident has increased from 77 days to 85 days in this year’s research. Table 3 summarizes 
the average cost of insider\-related incidents for the three types of incidents and seven activity centers. As 
reported, containment and investigation of the incident represent the most expensive activity centers. Least 
expensive are ex\-post analysis and escalation. The activity costs have increased 80 percent since 2016\.

Which insider incidents are you most concerned about?

Of all the types of insider threat in this research, organizations are most concerned 
about credential theft. As discussed previously, credential thefts have almost doubled 
since the last study and cost the most to remediate. Fifty\-five percent of respondents say 
they are most concerned about a hacker stealing the valid credentials of an employee. Far 
fewer respondents (21 percent) are concerned about the negligent insider.

CONCLUSIONS 

The rapid digital transformation over the past two years unintentionally 
set the stage for insider threats to grow.

From the use of personal devices to increased use of the cloud, organizations are recognizing the traditional 
approach to securing data just won’t cut it. 

This illustrates the importance for organizations to implement a people\-centric Insider Threat Management 
(ITM) program, one that is designed for today’s modern work\-from\-anywhere world. An effective ITM program 
is built with cross\-team collaboration, including IT, HR, compliance and legal, to name a few. Having both 
technical and non\-technical representatives on the team ensures the organization can achieve the three 
successful elements of an ITM program: 

Visibility

Consistency

Transparency

Implement an ITM platform that 
provides your organization with 
the visibility and context into data 
movement. Doing so grants you the 
opportunity to accelerate both your 
mean time to detect (MTTD) and 
your mean time to respond (MTTR). 
With a better understanding of why 
data is moving a certain way, you 
can effectively reduce the average 
number of days it takes to contain 
an insider threat incident.

Evaluate the organization’s risk, 
including any high\-risk insiders, and 
develop a dedicated insider threat 
function within the organization. 
Part of this process should also 
include establishing a consistent and 
repeatable process to detect and 
respond to relevant insider threat 
alerts based on context. Leveraging 
a purpose\-built insider risk solution 
ensures there is a consistent process 
in place to reduce the MTTD and MTTR.

Understanding what could work 
better next time requires an element 
of continuous improvement. Being 
open to lessons learned can 
enhance an organization’s efforts 
to evolve with the changing risk 
environment more effectively. 

As more insider incidents occur and the time to contain them increases, advanced technologies are important 
to reducing insider threats. Establishing an ITM program that empowers your organization to confidently 
identify and detect risky user behavior and data interaction, and respond to the incident, is key when it comes 
to preventing data loss and mitigating insider risk.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS 
RESEARCH IS TO PROVIDE 
GUIDANCE ON WHAT AN 
INSIDER THREAT CAN COST 
AN ORGANIZATION. 

This cost study is unique in addressing the core 
systems and business process\-related activities 
that drive a range of expenditures associated 
with a company’s response to insider negligence 
and criminal behaviors. In this study, we define 
an insider\-related incident as one that results 
in the diminishment of a company’s core data, 
networks or enterprise systems. It also includes 
attacks perpetrated by external actors who steal 
the credentials of legitimate employees/users 
(i.e., imposter risk). 

Our benchmark methods attempt to elicit the actual 
experiences and consequences of insider\-related 
incidents. Based on interviews with a variety of senior\-
level individuals in each organization we classify the 
costs according to two different cost streams:

 The costs related to minimizing insider threats or 
what we refer to as the internal cost activity centers.

 The costs related to the consequences of incidents, 
or what we refer to as the external effect of the event 
or attack. 

We analyze the internal cost centers sequentially 
starting with monitoring and surveillance of the 
insider threat landscape and ending with remediation 
activities. Also included are the costs due to lost 
business opportunities and business disruption. 
In each of the cost activity centers we asked 
respondents to estimate the direct costs, indirect 
costs and, when applicable, opportunity costs. 

These are defined as follows:

 Direct cost – the direct expense outlay to 
accomplish a given activity.

 Indirect cost – the amount of time, effort and 
other organizational resources spent, but not as a 
direct cash outlay.

 Opportunity cost – the cost resulting from lost 
business opportunities as a consequence 
of reputation diminishment after the incident. 

External costs such as the loss of information 
assets, business disruption, equipment damage 
and revenue loss, were captured using shadow\-
costing methods. Total costs were allocated to 
seven discernible cost vectors.4 

4 We acknowledge that these seven cost categories are not mutually independent and they do not represent an exhaustive list of all cost activity centers.

company’s response to insider\-related incidents. The seven internal cost activity centers in our framework include:5

01 

02 

03 

04 

05 

06 

07 

 Monitoring and surveillance: Activities that enable an organization to 
reasonably detect and possibly deter insider incidents or attacks. This includes 
allocated (overhead) costs of certain enabling technologies that enhance 
mitigation or early detection.

 Investigation: Activities necessary to thoroughly uncover the source, scope, 
and magnitude of one or more incidents. 

 Escalation: Activities taken to raise awareness about actual incidents among 
key stakeholders within the company. The escalation activity also includes the 
steps taken to organize an initial management response.

 Incident response: Activities relating to the formation and engagement 
of the incident response team including the steps taken to formulate a final 
management response.

 Containment: Activities that focus on stopping or lessening the severity of 
insider incidents or attacks. These include shutting down vulnerable applications 
and endpoints.

 Ex\-post response: Activities to help the organization minimize potential 
future insider\-related incidents and attacks. It also includes steps taken to 
communicate with key stakeholders both within and outside the company, 
including the preparation of recommendations to minimize potential harm.

 Remediation: Activities associated with repairing and remediating the 
organization’s systems and core business processes. These include the 
restoration of damaged information assets and IT infrastructure. 

In addition to the above process\-related activities, organizations often experience external consequences 
or costs associated with the aftermath of incidents. Our research shows that four general cost activities 
associated with these external consequences are as follows:

04

general cost 
activities

01

03 

04 

 Cost of information loss or theft: Loss or theft of sensitive and confidential 
information as a result of an insider attack. Such information includes trade 
secrets, intellectual properties (including source code), customer information 
and employee records. This cost category also includes the cost of data breach 
notification in the event that personal information is wrongfully acquired.

 Cost of business disruption: The economic impact of downtime or unplanned 
outages that prevent the organization from meeting its data processing requirements.

 Cost of equipment damage: The cost to remediate equipment and other IT assets 
as a result of insider attacks to information resources and critical infrastructure.

 Lost revenue: The loss of customers (churn) and other stakeholders because of 
system delays or shutdowns as a result of an insider attack. To extrapolate this cost, 
we use a shadow costing method that relies on the “lifetime value” of an average 
customer as defined for each participating organization.

5 Internal costs are extrapolated using labor (time) as a surrogate for direct and indirect costs. This is also used to allocate an overhead component for fixed 

costs such as multiyear investments in technologies.

Our benchmark instrument is designed to collect 
descriptive information from IT, information security 
and other key individuals about the actual costs 
incurred either directly or indirectly as a result of 
insider\-related incidents or attacks actually detected. 
Our cost method does not require subjects to provide 
actual accounting results, but instead relies on 
estimation and extrapolation from interview data over 
a four\-week period.

Cost estimation is based on confidential diagnostic 
interviews with key respondents within each 
benchmarked organization. Data collection methods 
did not include actual accounting information, but 
instead relied upon numerical estimation based on 

the knowledge and experience of each participant. 
Within each category, cost estimation was a two\-
stage process. First, the benchmark instrument 
required individuals to rate direct cost estimates 
for each cost category by marking a range variable 
defined in the following number line format.

How to use the number line: The number line 
provided under each data breach cost category is 
one way to obtain your best estimate for the sum of 
cash outlays, labor and overhead incurred. Please 
mark only one point somewhere between the lower 
and upper limits set above. You can reset the lower 
and upper limits of the number line at any time during 
the interview process.

Post your estimate of direct costs here for \[presented cost category]

LL \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ UL

We carefully limited items to only those cost activities 
considered crucial to the measurement of cost to 
keep the benchmark instrument to a manageable 
size. Based on discussions with learned experts, the 
final set of items focused on a finite set of direct or 
indirect cost activities. After collecting benchmark 
information, each instrument was examined carefully 
for consistency and completeness. In this study, a 
few companies were rejected because of incomplete, 
inconsistent or blank responses.

Field research was launched in September 2021\. To 
maintain consistency for all benchmark companies, 
information was collected about the organizations’ 
experience was limited to four consecutive weeks. 
This time frame was not necessarily the same 
time period as other organizations in this study. 
The extrapolated direct and indirect costs were 
annualized by dividing the total cost collected over 
four weeks (ratio \= 4/52 weeks).

The numerical value obtained from the number line 
rather than a point estimate for each presented cost 
category preserved confidentiality and ensured a 
higher response rate. The benchmark instrument also 
required practitioners to provide a second estimate 
for indirect and opportunity costs, separately. 

Cost estimates were then compiled for each 
organization based on the relative magnitude of these 
costs in comparison to a direct cost within a given 
category. Finally, we administered general interview 
questions to obtain additional facts, including 
estimated revenue losses as a result of the insider\-
related incident or attack.

The size and scope of survey items was limited 
to known cost categories that cut across different 
industry sectors. In our experience, a survey 
focusing on process yields a higher response rate 
and better quality of results. We also used a paper 
instrument, rather than an electronic survey, to 
provide greater assurances of confidentiality. 

To maintain complete confidentiality, the survey 
instrument did not capture company\-specific 
information of any kind. Subject materials contained 
no tracking codes or other methods that could link 
responses to participating companies.

However, there are inherent limitations with this benchmark 
research that need to be carefully considered before 
drawing conclusions from findings.

 Non\-statistical results: Our study draws upon a representative, non\-statistical sample of 
organizations experiencing one or more insider\-related incidents during this past 12 months. 
Statistical inferences, margins of error and confidence intervals cannot be applied to this 
data given that our sampling methods are not scientific.

 Non\-response: The current findings are based on a small representative sample of 
benchmarks. In this study, 159 companies completed the benchmark process. Non\-
response bias was not tested so it is always possible companies that did not participate are 
substantially different in terms of underlying data breach cost.

 Sampling\-frame bias: Because our sampling frame is judgmental, the quality of results 
is influenced by the degree to which the frame is representative of the population of 
companies being studied. It is our belief that the current sampling frame is biased toward 
companies with more mature privacy or information security programs.

 Company\-specific information: The benchmark information is sensitive and confidential. 
Thus, the current instrument does not capture company\-identifying information. It also allows 
individuals to use categorical response variables to disclose demographic information about 
the company and industry category. 

 Unmeasured factors: To keep the interview script concise and focused, we decided to 
omit other important variables from our analyses such as leading trends and organizational 
characteristics. The extent to which omitted variables might explain benchmark results 
cannot be determined.

 Extrapolated cost results: The quality of benchmark research is based on the integrity 
of confidential responses provided by respondents in participating companies. While certain 
checks and balances can be incorporated into the benchmark process, there is always the 
possibility that respondents did not provide accurate or truthful responses. In addition, the 
use of cost extrapolation methods rather than actual cost data may inadvertently introduce 
bias and inaccuracies.
