## Introduction
Ponemon Institute is pleased to present the findings of the 2022 Cost of Insider Threats Global Report.  
THIS IS THE FOURTH 
BENCHMARK STUDY CONDUCTED 
WITH THE EXPLICIT PURPOSE 
TO UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIAL 
CONSEQUENCES THAT RESULT 
FROM INSIDER THREATS. 
A SECONDARY FOCUS IS 
TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO HOW 
WELL ORGANIZATIONS ARE 
MITIGATING THESE RISKS. 
The first Cost of Insider Threats: Global study was conducted in 2016 and focused exclusively on companies in 
North America. Since then, the research has expanded to include organizations in Europe, Middle East, Africa 
and Asia-Pacific with a global headcount of 500 to more than 75,000. In this year’s study, we interviewed 1,004 
IT and IT security practitioners in 278 organizations that experienced one or more material events caused by an 
insider. A total of 6,803 insider incidents are represented in this research.
In the context of this research, insider threats are defined as:

A careless or negligent 
employee or contractor

A criminal or 
malicious insider

A credential thief

## Executive Summary
INSIDER THREATS HAVE 
INCREASED IN BOTH FREQUENCY 
AND COST OVER THE PAST TWO 
YEARS. CREDENTIAL THEFTS, 
FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE ALMOST 
DOUBLED IN NUMBER SINCE 2020.

However, despite insider threats having increased across all three insider threat profiles, 
insider threats caused by careless or negligent employees are the most prevalent.
According to the findings, 56% of incidents experienced by organizations represented 
in this research were due to negligence, and the average annual cost to remediate the 
incident was $6.6 million. 
Research also showed that the cost of an insider threat varies significantly based on the 
type of incident. This is largely due to the type of activities required following an insider 
threat incident, including monitoring & surveillance, investigation, escalation, incident 
response, containment, ex-post analysis and remediation. 
Following are some key statistics on the cost of insider-related incidents over a 
12-month period:

THE FOLLOWING ARE 
THE MOST SALIENT FINDINGS 
FROM THIS RESEARCH.
The time to contain an insider incident 
increased from the last study. 
The negligent insider is the 
root cause of most incidents. 
A total of 3,807 attacks, or 56%, were caused 
by employee or contractor negligence, costing 
on average $484,931 per incident. This could be 
the result of a variety of factors, including not 
ensuring their devices are secured, not following 
the company’s security policy, or forgetting to 
patch and upgrade. 
Malicious insiders caused 26% 
or 1,749 incidents at an average 
cost per incident of $648,062. 
Malicious insiders are employees or authorized 
individuals who use their data access for harmful, 
unethical or illegal activities. Because employees 
are increasingly granted access to more information 
to enhance productivity in today’s work-from-
anywhere workforce, malicious insiders are harder 
to detect than external attackers or hackers.

12% of incidents

Average number of days

85 DAYS

It took an average of 85 days to contain the incident, 
an increase from 77 days in the previous study.
Only 12% of incidents were contained in less than 30 days.   

Credential theft incidents 
have almost doubled 
since the last study. 
At an average of $804,997 per incident, 
credential theft is the costliest to remediate. 
The intent of the credential thief is to steal users’ 
credentials that will grant them access to critical 
data and information. A favorite technique 
for many of these credential thieves is social 
engineering attacks, primarily phishing. A total 
of an average 1,247 incidents or 18% involved 
stolen credentials in this year’s research.
The frequency of companies 
experiencing incidents has 
increased significantly. 
According to the 2022 research, 67 percent 
of companies are experiencing between 21 
and more than 40 incidents per year. This is 
an increase from 60 percent in 2020 and 53 
percent in 2018 of companies having between 
21 and more than 40 incidents.

Disruption or downtime and 
investment in technologies 
represent the most significant 
costs when dealing with 
insider threats. 
The two largest costs are the impact of business 
disruption due to diminished employee productivity 
(23 percent of total cost) and technology, which 
includes the amortized value and licensing for 
software and hardware that are deployed in 
response to insider-related incidents (21 percent).

Companies spend the most on containment of the insider 
security incident. 
An average of $184,548 is spent to contain the consequences of an insider threat. The least amount of average 
cost is for escalation $32,228 and monitoring and surveillance $35,080. Incidents that took less than 30 days to 
contain had the lowest average annual cost of activities at $11.23 million. In contrast, average annual activity 
costs for incidents that took more than 90 days is $17.19 million.

$22.68M
$8.13M
Organizational size affects the 
cost per incident. 
The annual cost of incidents varies according to 
organizational size. Large organizations with a 
headcount of more than 75,000 spent an average of 
$22.68 million over the past year to resolve insider-
related incidents. To deal with the consequences of 
an insider incident, smaller-sized organizations with a 
headcount below 500 spent an average of $8.13 million.

North American companies 
are spending more than the 
average cost on activities 
that deal with insider threats. 
The total average cost of activities to resolve 
insider threats over a 12-month period is 
$15.38 million. Companies in North America 
experienced the highest total cost at $17.53 
million. European companies had the next 
highest cost at $15.44 million.

$17.53M
$15.44M
Financial services and services organizations 
have the highest average activity costs. 
The average activity cost for financial services is $21.25 million and services 
is $18.65 million. Service organizations represent a wide range of companies 
including accounting, consultancy and professional service firms.

05
signs that your 
organization is 
at risk
01	
Employees are not trained to fully understand and apply laws, 
mandates, or regulatory requirements related to their work 
and that affects the organization’s security.
02	
Employees are unaware of the steps they should take at all times 
to ensure that the devices they use—both company issued 
and BYOD—are secured at all times.
03	
Employees are sending highly confidential data to an unsecured 
location in the cloud, exposing the organization to risk.
04	
Employees break your organization’s security policies 
to simplify tasks.
05	
Employees expose your organization to risk if they do not keep devices 
and services patched and upgraded to the latest versions at all times.  
Interviews with participants in this research revealed the following 
insights into insider threats.
In addition to determining the cost of insider threats for companies in this research, we interviewed participants 
about their experiences with the threat and what they are doing to reduce risks.
Of all the types of insider threat in this research, organizations are most concerned about credential 
theft. Credential thefts have almost doubled since the last study and cost the most to remediate. Fifty-five 
percent of respondents say they are most concerned about a hacker stealing the valid credentials of an 
employee. Far fewer respondents (21 percent) are concerned about the negligent insider.
Negligent employees and credential thieves are the root causes of most insider incidents. Fifty-seven 
percent of respondents say the insider incidents involved employee negligence and 51 percent say a malicious 
outsider stole data by compromising insider credentials or accounts.
Vulnerable IoT devices are of greatest risk to data loss. Sixty-three percent of respondents say they are 
worried about unmanaged IoT devices resulting in the loss of sensitive data. This is followed by the cloud 
(52 percent of respondents) and the network (51 percent of respondents).
Most sensitive data is in employees’ email. Sixty-five percent of respondents say email is where employees 
store their organizations most sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual 
property (IP) and other critical business information.
Malicious insiders use corporate email to steal sensitive data. Seventy-four percent of respondents 
say malicious insiders emailed sensitive data to outside parties followed by scanning for open ports and 
vulnerabilities (62 percent of respondents) and accessing sensitive data not associated with the role or function 
(60 percent of respondents).
As the volume and time to contain insider threats increases, advanced technologies such as user 
behavior tools and automation are important to helping reduce insider threats. User behavior-based 
tools for detecting insider threats are considered essential or very important to reducing insider threats 
(62 percent of respondents). This is followed by automation for the prevention, investigation, escalation, 
containment and remediation of insider incidents (55 percent of respondents) and AI and machine learning to 
prevent, investigate, escalate, contain and remediate insider incidents (54 percent of respondents).

## About the Study
ABOUT THE STUDY:
OUR RESEARCH FOCUSES ON 
ACTUAL INSIDER-RELATED 
EVENTS OR INCIDENTS THAT 
IMPACT ORGANIZATIONAL COSTS 
OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS. 
Our methods attempt to capture both direct and indirect costs, including, 
but not limited to, the following business threats: 
	
- Theft or loss of mission critical data or intellectual property
	
- Impact of downtime on organizational productivity
	
- Damages to equipment and other assets
	
- Cost to detect and remediate systems and core business processes
	
- Legal and regulatory impact, including litigation defense cost
	
- Lost confidence and trust among key stakeholders
	
- Diminishment of marketplace brand and reputation
This research utilizes an activity-based costing (ABC) framework. Our fieldwork was 
conducted over a two-month period concluding in September 2021. Our final benchmark 
sample consisted of 278 separate organizations. A total of 1,004 interviews were 
conducted with key personnel in these organizations. Activity costs for the present study 
were derived from actual meetings or site visits for all participants conducted under strict 
confidentiality. Targeted organizations were:
	
- Commercial and public sector organizations
	
- Locations throughout the following regions: North America, Europe, Middle East 
& Africa and Asia-Pacific
	
- Central IT function with control over on-premise and/or cloud environment
	
- Experienced one or more material incidents caused by careless, malicious 
or criminal insiders

that summarizes all 
salient research findings
In this report, we present an objective framework that measures the full cost impact of 
events or incidents caused by insiders. Following are the three case profiles that were used 
to categorize and analyze insider-related cost for 278 organizations:
	
- Careless or negligent employee or contractor
	
- Criminal insider including employee or contractor malice
	
- Employee/user credential theft (a.k.a. imposter risk)
Our first step in this research was the recruitment of global organizations. The researchers 
utilized diagnostic interviews and activity-based costing to capture and extrapolate cost 
data. Ponemon Institute executed all phases of this research project, which included the 
following steps:
Working sessions to 
establish areas of inquiry

THE SMALLEST NUMBER OF 
INCIDENTS IS ONE. 
![Figure 5. Frequency of 6,803 incidents for three insider profiles]
Employees or contractors continue to be the 
primary source of an insider threat. Figure 5 
shows the distribution of 6,803 reported attacks 
analyzed in our sample. A total of 3,807 attacks (or 
56 percent) were caused by employee or contractor 
negligence. Criminal or malicious insiders caused 
another 1,749 attacks (or 26 percent) and there were 
1,247 credential thefts (18 percent).

![Figure 6. Frequency for three profiles of insider incidents]
The average number of criminal and credential theft incidents have almost 
doubled. As shown in Figure 6, credential theft has increased from an average of 3.2 
incidents in 2020 to 5.7 incidents in this year’s study. Criminal and malicious insider 
incidents increased from 5.4 to 6.4. [^1] Employee or contractor negligence decreased slightly 
from 14.5 to 13.7.

[^1]: The 2016 data only pertains to US companies. The 2022 data includes North America, Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia-
Pacific. We believe the data is comparable because US companies represented in the 2016 report are multinationals.

## The Cost of Insider Incidents
THE COST OF INSIDER INCIDENTS
![Figure 11. Percentage of insider cost by consequence to business organization]
Disruption or downtime and technologies represent the most significant costs 
when dealing with insider incidents. Figure 11 reports the percentage of insider cost for 
careless or negligent employees, criminal insiders and credential theft according to seven 
cost categories. The two largest cost categories are the impact of business disruption due 
to diminished employee/user productivity (23 percent of total cost) and technology, which 
includes the amortized value and the licensing for software and hardware that are deployed 
in response to insider-related incidents (21 percent). 
Process costs include governance and control system activities in response to threats 
and attacks. Overhead includes a wide array of miscellaneous costs incurred to support 
personnel as well as the IT security infrastructure.

Figure 12 shows the distribution of insider incidents in ascending order by headcount or size of the 
participating companies.  As can be seen, the upward slope suggests that the frequency of insider incidents 
is positively correlated with organizational size. The correlation is most salient for larger-sized companies.

The average annual cost per incident for the three types of incidents 
Credential theft continues to be the costliest insider security incident. Table 2 presents the average cost 
per incident, the average number of incidents and the average annualized cost per year. As shown, employee 
or contractor negligence is most frequent. However, the average cost per this type of incident is far less than 
credential theft and malicious insider incidents. 
The cost of criminal insider incidents steadily increased between 2018 and 2020 from $614,192 to $755,761 but 
declined to $648,062 in this year’s research. The average number of credential thefts has increased significantly 
since 2018 and the average cost for remediating these incidents is $804,997 in this year’s research.

## Cost Analysis
COST ANALYSIS
THIS STUDY ADDRESSES 
THE CORE PROCESS-RELATED 
ACTIVITIES THAT DRIVE A 
RANGE OF EXPENDITURES 
AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH 
A COMPANY’S RESPONSE TO 
INSIDER-RELATED INCIDENTS. 
The seven cost activity centers in our framework are defined as follows:[^2] 
	
- Monitoring and surveillance: Activities that enable an organization to reasonably 
detect and possibly deter insider incidents or attacks. This includes allocated (overhead) 
costs of certain enabling technologies that enhance mitigation or early detection.
	
- Investigation: Activities necessary to thoroughly uncover the source, scope, and 
magnitude of one or more incidents. 
	
- Escalation: Activities taken to raise awareness about actual incidents among key 
stakeholders within the company. The escalation activity also includes the steps taken to 
organize an initial management response.
	
- Incident response: Activities relating to the formation and engagement of the incident 
response team including the steps taken to formulate a final management response.
	
- Containment: Activities that focus on stopping or lessening the severity of insider 
incidents or attacks. These include shutting down vulnerable applications and endpoints.
	
- Ex-post response: Activities to help the organization minimize potential future 
insider-related incidents and attacks. It also includes steps taken to communicate with 
key stakeholders both within and outside the company, including the preparation of 
recommendations to minimize potential harm.
	
- Remediation: Activities associated with repairing and remediating the organization’s 
systems and core business processes. These include the restoration of damaged 
information assets and IT infrastructure.

[^2]: Internal costs are extrapolated using labor (time) as a surrogate for direct and indirect costs. This is also used to allocate an overhead 
component for fixed costs such as multiyear investments in technologies.

TABLE 3. 
Average trend in activity cost per incident for 7 activity centers.
Companies spend the most on containment of the insider security incident. As discussed, the average 
time to contain an incident has increased from 77 days to 85 days in this year’s research. Table 3 summarizes 
the average cost of insider-related incidents for the three types of incidents and seven activity centers. As 
reported, containment and investigation of the incident represent the most expensive activity centers. Least 
expensive are ex-post analysis and escalation. The activity costs have increased 80 percent since 2016.
