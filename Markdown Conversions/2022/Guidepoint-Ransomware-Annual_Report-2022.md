GRIT
Ransomware Report

Methodology

Data collected for this report was obtained from publicly 

available resources, including threat groups themselves, 

and has not been validated by alleged victims. Thus, the 

number of publicly observed attacks and the actual 

number of attacks conducted may not be equal. Some 

groups do not publicize all of their victims and almost all 

groups offer an option to withhold announcement if the 

victim pays a ransom within a specified timeframe 

and/or remove the victims once a ransom has been paid. 

Additionally, some groups exaggerate their numbers by 

including incomplete information about their victim or 

claiming an attack despite successfully attacking only a 

small subset of their target. For these reasons, the data 

in this report is useful in aggregate, but should be 

evaluated as a report consisting of data sources that 

have variability. Despite the variability, this report is still 

an accurate representation of the total ransomware 

threat landscape.

Ransomware 
Summary

2022 was yet another year with ransomware topping the charts as the most prolific and impactful threat to our networks, 
data, and operational capabilities. With 2,507 publicly posted victims across 40 industry verticals, ransomware groups were 
responsible for publicly posting 6\.87 victims per day to their respective leak sites. GRIT tracked 54 groups utilizing a double\-
extortion methodology, many of which are utilizing a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) model to increase productivity and 
maximize revenue.

The first quarter of 2022 started high with a posting rate that mirrored the value of Bitcoin, and as the price of Bitcoin became 
more volatile, so did the rates of victim postings, to a degree. Despite the volatility of cryptocurrency, ransomware victim 
postings remained frequent, as no quarter saw less than 569 total victims. Significant events, including the rebranding of 
Conti and the change in version from Lockbit2 to Lockbit3, also influenced the rates of ransomware victims and led to some 
volatility; however, yearly trends show that 2022 ended on a high note for ransomware groups.

Unsurprisingly, as 2022 progressed, the United States and other western countries were the main targets of ransomware 
groups. Western countries made up 77% of all publicly posted victims in 2022, with the United States accounting for 38\.9% 
of total victims claimed by ransomware groups.

Similarly, the manufacturing and technology industries were consistently the most targeted industries, with construction and 
healthcare following close behind. Much of the top 10 most targeted industries remained consistent during 2022, although 
there was some movement within the top targeted industries from month to month.

As GRIT’s methodology introduced the concept of ransomware group categories, we began to take a deeper and more 
granular look into how ransomware groups operate, how they target, and some of the characteristics that make them unique. 
To kick this annual report off, we will cover the ransomware group taxonomy we created over the course of the year, then 
we’ll dive deep into 2022 to examine ransomware statistics and trends. If you just want a breakdown of the Q4 numbers, 
we’ll separate those out after the annual review. Finally, we’ll finish with a look at 2023 with some predictions of what we 
can expect, as ransomware will likely continue to be front and center as the most impactful cybersecurity threat we must 
defend against on a daily basis.

We are sharing our ransomware group taxonomy definitions as 

ransomware groups by placing them into these four categories:

part of this annual report with the hope that they will be used 

• Full\-Time

• Splinter 

• Rebrand 

• Ephemeral

and further developed by others in the community. By using this 

taxonomy, we believe the community will be able to more easily 

identify ransomware rebranding and group behaviors, which

will lead to significant degradation in their capabilities to 

conduct operations.

Annual Ransomware Trends

Throughout 2022, victim posting 

rates remained fairly consistent, 

with the biggest lull occurring in late 

June and early July. This lull can 

most likely be attributed to the 

shift from Lockbit 2 to Lockbit 3, 

although challenges in the crypto 

currency market may have also 

had an impact. (More on that 

in a minute)

On average, there were 11\.2 groups 

operating during any week in 2022\. 

Notably, every month in 2022 saw 

at least one new group emerge with 

double extortion capabilities.

March was the most active month of 

2022 with 279 claimed victims, with 

April coming in at 278\. Together 

March and April accounted for 22% 

of the total victims of 2022\.

One of the strongest correlations 

that we found when analyzing the 

data for all of 2022 was the link 

between victim posting rates and 

the price of Bitcoin.

Due to the way that groups tend to 

group their victim postings, the 

rate of posting doesn’t seem to 

correlate to Bitcoin at first. But 

when we used a 4 period moving 

average to normalize the posting 

rates, the link became clear.

This suggests that threat groups 

closely monitor Bitcoin prices and 

increase operations while Bitcoin 

prices are high to maximize profits. 

Likewise, it suggests that threat 

groups may slow down operations 

while Bitcoin prices are more 

volatile to reduce potential losses.

2022 Correlating Geo\-Political 
and World Events 

The following graph shows the daily rate of victim posting and active groups, overlaid with significant world events that may have influenced 
ransomware activity. Save for September 12, almost all the peaks and valleys for the year correlate to major world events.

• January 7, Eastern Orthodox Christmas Day: January 7, Eastern Orthodox Christmas Day: We observed a two\-week slowdown following 

Orthodox Christmas Day, a commonly observed holiday in Russia.

• Feb 21\-28, Russia Invasion of Ukraine and Conti Leaks: There was a sharp–yet short\-lived–decline in ransomware activity following the 

Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Conti leaks.

• March 28, Bitcoin price peaks at $47k: In the weeks leading up to March 28, we observed a rapid increase in ransomware activity that 

peaked as Bitcoin prices skyrocketed to $47k per bitcoin.

• May 16 \- June 6, Conti denounces AlphV and Lockbit, Crypto Market Shrinkage Begins: Ransomware rates begin to fall as competition 

and animosity occurs between ransomware groups and cryptocurrency markets begin to plummet. 

• June 27, Lockbit3 Release: Ransomware rates steadily increase following the official release of Lockbit3\.

• November 14, World Cup Starts: Ransomware activity initially declines during the World Cup, but spikes as the World Cup progresses.

During 2022, Lockbit was responsible 

for the vast majority of ransomware 

victims, and at the end of the year 

accounted for 33% of all publicly 

posted ransomware victims.

Despite entering the double extortion 

game beginning in late April, Blackbasta

still ended 2022 as the 4th most 

impactful ransomware group.

Vice Society began 2022 with a huge 

spike in publicly posted victims, posting 

25 victims on January 6th. However, a 

sharp decrease and “low and slow” 

approach throughout the remainder of 

the year led them to 6th place overall 

among ransomware groups.

Despite both getting a late start in 

2022, BianLian and Royal ended up 

as the 7th and 8th most impactful 

ransomware groups of 2022, 

respectively.

In 2022, Full\-Time groups accounted for the most activity in 

the most highly impacted industries.

Unsurprisingly, Lockbit was the most impactful Full\-Time 

ransomware group in the top four impacted industries of 2022\. 

Surprisingly, there more healthcare victims targeted by Lockbit

were targeted after the release of Lockbit3 (51%), despite 

Lockbit explicitly calling out healthcare as a sensitive industry 

that should not be touched unless they are "for profit." 

Reviewing Lockbit’s late 2022 healthcare victims, some 

victims are for\-profit organizations, but others are focused 

on patient health.

Despite receiving less focus by researchers, Hive was the third 

most active group in 2022, which is highlighted by their top 3 

representation in the Technology and Healthcare industries.

Blackbasta is the only non\-Full\-Time group represented in

the top\-impact groups. However, there is strong correlation 

between BlackBasta’s TTPs and the now\-defunct Conti, so 

their presence as a Rebrand is less surprising in this ranking.

Alongside Vice Society’s strong presence in Healthcare 

targeting, they also accounted for more than 1/3rd of all 

Education victims (48 out of 143\) for the year. Their track 

record across the year has consistently shown their 

willingness to target sensitive industries.

Q1 and Q4 were the most active 

quarters of the year, while Q2 and

Full\-Time group activity steadily 

declined as 2022 progressed, which 

may show the potential impacts of 

Conti’s mid\-year rebrand effort and 

the proliferation of new Rebrand 

groups entering the scene.

Mirroring the decline in Full\-Time 

group activity, Rebrand group 

activity grew steadily as 2022 

progressed, culminating in a large 

surge in Q4\.

Splinter and Ephemeral group 

activity remained consistent 

throughout 2022\.

2022 Average 
Operating Duration 
by Group Type

The average days active in 2022 for each group 

type represents a clear illustration of the 

taxonomies defined by GRIT.

The average operating duration of Splinter 

groups rivaled the average duration of rebrand 

groups. This illustrates the maturation process 

pursued by many groups as they progress from 

Splinter, to rebrand, and potentially full\-time. If 

an Ephemeral group matures into a successful 

splinter group, it is likely that they will mature 

into higher and more consistent group types.

On average, ephemeral groups only operated 

for 21 days–showing their "flash in the pan" 

nature–and contribute to the volatility 

associated with the number of groups 

operating during any given week.

Manufacturing was by far the most targeted 

industry among Full\-Time ransomware 

group victims. This carries over to both 

Rebrand and Splinter groups, with only 

Ephemeral groups preferring to target the 

Technology sector over Manufacturing.

Following Manufacturing, Full\-Time and 

Rebrand groups targeted Construction and 

Technology victims at near identical rates.

Splinter and Ephemeral groups are more 

likely to target sensitive industries like 

healthcare and education relative to their 

total victimology.

Retail and Wholesale appears in the top 5 

industries for of all group types except 

Ephemeral.

Rebrand is the only group type that 

included Industrial Services in their top 5, 

of which Blackbasta accounted for 55% 

of victims.

Industry Targeting by Group Type

While Full\-Time groups represent the most 

claimed victims across all categories, 

Rebrand groups disproportionately target 

Manufacturing victims relative to their 

total victimology. 

Full\-Time and Splinter groups have a 

similar percentage relative to their total.

Ephemeral groups have the highest 

percentage of Technology victims relative 

to their total victimology while Full\-Time, 

Rebrand, and Splinter groups have a 

similar relative percentage.

Splinter groups have the highest 

percentage of Healthcare and Government 

victims relative to their total victimology.

Rebrand groups have the lowest targeting 

of Banking and Finance and Government 

by far relative to their total victimology.

Top 5 Countries per Group Type

Regardless of group type, the United States was the most targeted country.

Full\-Time groups are far more likely to target China with ransomware attacks (23 in 2022 
compared to 4 combined for all other group types).

Full\-time and Rebrand groups have a much more distributed targeting presence in South 
America compared to Splinter and Ephemeral groups, which were both exclusively focused on 
Brazil and Columbia.

Outside of targeting the United States, Full\-Time and Rebrand groups are more likely to focus 
their efforts on western countries while Splinter and Ephemeral groups are much more evenly 
distributed around the world.

All group types show a lack of targeting former Soviet Union countries.

Major Events and Observations

2022 Recap

Major Events and Observations 

•

In Q1, the industry observed Conti’s internal struggles stemming from their back and forth support for Russia in 
their conflict with Ukraine. 

o This ultimately resulted in a massive leak of their playbooks, infrastructure, source code, and more that led to an 

unrecoverable state for the group.

o Conti disbanded early in 2022 in favor of pursuing operations after a thorough rebranding process into groups such as 

Blackbasta, AlphV, and more.

• More ransomware groups are seeing the value of single extortion methodology

o Lockbit explicitly allows exfiltration of data of all industries, including critical infrastructure

o More groups are seeing the benefits of leveraging data exfiltration for payment without encryption

• Vulnerability exploitation was solidified as one of the most effective methods of achieving initial access into 

victim networks

o Many critical vulnerabilities were either being exploited in the wild at the time of initial disclosure while other 

vulnerabilities were being weaponized within days of disclosure. 

o Organizations are hardly, if at all, able to keep up in their normal patching cycles.

o Even splinter and ephemeral groups are seeing the advantages of targeting ESXi hypervisor servers as a means of 

encrypting key parts of a victim’s infrastructure simultaneously

o Groups of all maturities understand the value of hypervisors and are using these to put significant pressure on victim 

organizations to pay ransoms

• Relationships with initial access brokers are becoming more apparent with ransomware groups

o Ransomware groups are seeing the value of initial access brokers and are leveraging their access of personal and 

organization owned devices to improve their operational efficiency and improve ROI

Threat actors are still leveraging many of the same tactics and techniques to compromise victim organizations

o Open RDP and SSH to the internet remain commonly exploited by threat actors

o Unpatched and dated vulnerabilities are still being successfully leveraged for initial access

Threat actors continue to demonstrate their flexibility

o Microsoft’s change of default Office Macro behavior was a step in the right direction, but ultimately forced a rapid 

change in initial delivery methods for email\-based attacks.

Q4 Ransomware Trends Recap

Q4 Summary

Now that we’ve taken a deep dive into overall ransomware activity in 2022, we wanted to take a step back and review 

the activity we tracked during Q4 of 2022\.

Q4 saw a rise back to Q1 victim posting rates after a two\-quarter slowdown in publicly observed activity. Lockbit

continued its reign as the most impactful ransomware group, while new groups like Royal entered the double extortion 
realm with a bang. Major players like AlphV, Bian Lian, and Blackbasta maintained their presence in the top ransomware 

groups of the quarter with consistent activity. 

Interestingly, Lockbit publicly upheld their affiliate rules by banning an affiliate for encrypting a children’s hospital in 

Canada, while other groups, like Vice Society, continue to prove that no industry is off limits.

As Q4 ended, we observed ransomware trends continue to hold their place as the most likely and impactful eCrime

threat that all organizations across all industries face.

Victim posting rate was consistent 
in early Q4, but shortly after the 
mid\-November start of World Cup in 
Qatar the rate dropped sharply. 

The high number of groups active 
from week 42 through 47 also saw a 
steep drop after the World Cup, but 
the resurgence in mid\-December 
may correlate to a lull in new 
attacks as they negotiated with 
victims, followed by a surge in posts 
when negotiations went south.

However, this pullback was short\-
lived, as we observed a surge in 
mid\-December before returning to 
the average posting rate of Q4\.

Overall, Q4 saw a 15\.5% increase 
in reported victims and a minor 
increase from 27 active groups in 
Q3 to 30\.

In Q3 Manufacturing tied 

with Technology for most 

targeted industry, but in 

Q4 Manufacturing saw an 

aggressive 59% increase in 

public postings. At the same 

time, the Technology vertical 

saw a 9% decrease in publicly 

posted victims, widening the 

gap even further.

As noted in our last quarterly 

report, there is often very little 

change in the industries that 

make up the top 10 most 

targeted. However, in Q3 legal 

made a surge into the rankings 

and held a spot there through 

November, but was bumped 

from the list by the end of Q4\.

Geographic Breakdown of 
Ransomware Victims (Q4 2022\)

Similar to Q3, ransomware attacks 
targeted mostly western countries in Q4\.

Among the top 10, only India, Taiwan, 
and Australia were outside Europe and 
the Americas.

There was a 32% increase in victim 
posts in the US. Compared to Q3, India 
saw a 100% increase in the number of 
posted victims, bringing them into the 
top 10\.

New victim countries (countries that 
have not been seen in reports since 
GRIT began tracking) for the quarter 
included Monaco, Gambia, Greenland, 
Gibraltar, and Vanyuatu.

Ransomware 
Activity – Q4 2022

LockBit continues to be the most prolific 

ransomware group in Q4, despite a slowdown in 

victim posting. They hit a daily high of 18 victim 

posts in October, which makes it their third highest 

posting day in all of 2022\. Compared to Q3, LockBit

made a significant shift away from targeting in the 

legal industry this quarter.

We observed a a 57% increase in AlphV’s reported 

victims in Q4\. Alongside this increase, 34% of their 

annual Manufacturing and Technology victims were 

posted this quarter. 

Royal’s leak site went live at the beginning of Q4 in 

October, and by the end of the year had already 

claimed 63 victims. Despite their recent emergence, 

the group tied for the most targeting of the Food and 

Beverage industry in Q4\. Even with that focus, their 

victims span 24 industries across 14 countries.

 
 
 
2023 Predictions

2023 Predictions

First, we believe 2023 will continue to see an increase in 
ransomware rebranding.

•

•

GRIT’s 2022 threat actor trends show an increase in 
rebrand, splinter, and ephemeral group’s share of total 
victims as 2022 progressed

There has been at least one new group for every month 
of 2022, this will likely continue throughout 2023

Second, vulnerabilities will continue to be heavily researched 
and utilized for initial intrusion into networks.

•

The time to weaponization of these vulnerabilities is 
likely to decrease as 2023 progresses

Third, as organizations rely on the fundamentals of security to 
establish effective security programs and make the threat actors' 
lives harder, ransomware groups will likely move to single extortion 
attempts based on exfiltration of data where no encryption event 
occurs. We believe this will be especially true for critical 
infrastructure and sensitive industries.

Fourth, and this will aid in our second prediction, emerging 
technologies like ChatGPT, OpenAI, and others will be leveraged to 
automate social engineering and other initial intrusion capabilities.

Finally, as multifactor authentication and zero trust architecture 
continue to be adopted, personal devices will likely be targeted to 
establish initial intrusions into business networks.

•

Info stealers such as redline stealer, raccoon stealer, etc. will 
continue to be an extremely viable resource for threat actors to 
leverage as an initial intrusion vector.

2022 Wrap Up

After years of ransomware activity, it seems safe to say that ransomware is here to stay, for quite awhile at least. Ransomware groups are 

claiming victims at a staggering rate and new ransomware groups are formed, and sometimes disbanded, on a monthly basis. At the end of the 

day, the ransomware problem is still very real. 

GRIT’s goal with this research is to educate cybersecurity professionals and leadership, and to encourage security researchers to continue to 

work together to further our defensive and threat intelligence capabilities. If we continue to share intelligence and establish open and 

dynamic methods of communication, it’s possible that we can start to keep up with the ransomware threat. Through collaboration, we can 

start to be flexible and adaptable, just like our adversaries.

Ransomware groups will continue to target us on a regular basis and leverage any means necessary to accomplish their goals, but that doesn’t 

mean it’s all “doom and gloom” moving forward. Through well\-established cybersecurity foundations we can start to limit the risk associated 

with unpatched vulnerabilities and lack of visibility. We can focus on ensuring coverage with our security tools and that our analysts and 

leadership are well equipped to handle potential incidents as they arise. Admittedly, this is a large task for almost any team, but, if we focus 

on small wins, and we maintain forward progress, we will make it exponentially more difficult for ransomware groups to be successful. 

GRIT has already begun researching ransomware trends in 2023 and we plan to continue to extend our research capabilities to give granular 

and informative insights into ransomware groups. Through our continued research we hope to disrupt ransomware groups by arming 

cybersecurity professionals with knowledge and intelligence. 

So, here’s to 2023 and another successful year of intelligence sharing. Happy hunting!
