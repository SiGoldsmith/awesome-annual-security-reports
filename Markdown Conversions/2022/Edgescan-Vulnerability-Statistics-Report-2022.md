## Introduction
For our 7th Year running, welcome to the Edgescan Vulnerability Stats Report 2022. This report aims to demonstrate the state of full stack security based on thousands of security assessments and penetration tests performed globally, as delivered by the Edgescan SaaS during 2021.
Compiling this report and delving into the underlying data is still a joy as it let us understand the true state of cyber posture based on thousands of assessments and penetration tests. It gives unique insight into what’s going on from a trends and statistics perspective and indeed a snapshot of the overall state of cyber security.
The Edgescan report has become a reliable source for truly representing the global state of cyber security vulnerability management. This is becoming more evident as our unique dataset is now also part of other annual security analysis reports, such as the Verizon DBIR (we are happy contributors for many years now).
This year we examined vulnerability metrics from a known vulnerability (CVE), Malware, Ransomware and visibility standpoint (exposed services), coupling both internal and public Internet-facing systems. We also take a look at how quick we are fixing various vulnerabilities based on risk.
We still see high rates of known (i.e. patchable) vulnerabilities, which have working exploits in the wild, used by known nation state and cyber criminal groups.
We also decided to look at the state of cyber posture from an ASM (Attack Surface Management) standpoint. Exposed services are a real risk. Statistically some of the exposures have a very low percentage but many of them would result in a breach.
Remote access exposures across the attack surface are a worrying trend and accounted for 5% of total exposures in 2021.
So yes, patching and maintenance is still a challenge, demonstrating that it is not trivial to patch production systems. The MTTR (Mean Time to Remediation) stats also reflect on this issue. Detection on a constant basis needs improvement and as I’ve always said, visibility is paramount. The web application layer is where the majority of risk still resides, but some lower layer (Host/Operating system/Protocol) issues, if discovered, could also present headaches if exploited. CVE’s as old as 2015 are being used by ransomware and malware toolkits to exploit systems within “the perimeter“.
Attack Surface Management (Visibility) is a key driver to cyber security and based on our continuous asset profiling, we discuss how common sensitive and critical systems are exposed to the public Internet. The assumption here is that enterprises simply did not have the visibility or systems in place, to make them aware of, or inform them of the exposure.
This report provides a glimpse of a global snapshot across dozens of industry verticals and how to prioritize on what is important, as not all vulnerabilities are equal. We call out which threat actors are leveraging discovered vulnerabilities, which should be food for thought.
This year we included a section on API security based on the assessment of thousands of API’s in 2021. We list the Top API vulnerabilities and frequency of such.
Best Regards

## 2021 Year in Review
### Breaches of note and root causes of 2021
#### Log4j:
(CVE-2021-44228 – CVSS Score: 10) A zero-day vulnerability in the Log4j Java library, a remote code execution (RCE) flaw, has now been actively exploited in the wild since December 2021. The vulnerability is known as Log4Shell and is now being weaponized by botnets, including Mirai, CONTI, Konsari, and TellYouThePass groups, currently leveraging it in their campaigns. See https://www.edgescan.com/log4shell-quick-script/ for technical guidance. – Root cause: Remote Code Injection
#### Bitmart:
In December, Bitmart said a security breach permitted cyberattackers to steal circa $150 million in cryptocurrency, with total losses including damages, to reach $200 million. Criminals stole various crypto tokens on December 4, after using a stolen privacy key to gain access to one of BitMart’s hot wallets. – Root cause: Stolen authentication credentials
#### Robinhood:
Number Of Individuals Impacted: 7 million. Robinhood disclosed a data breach impacting five million users of the app. Email addresses, names, phone numbers, and more were accessed via a customer support system. For the vast majority of affected customers, the only information obtained was an email address or a full name. For 310 people, the information taken included their name, date of birth, and ZIP code. Of those, 10 customers had “more extensive account details revealed,” Robinhood said in a statement. - Root cause: customer-service reps were socially engineered into sharing information
#### UC San Diego Health:
UC San Diego Health said employee email accounts were compromised by criminals, leading to an exposure. Patient, student and employee data potentially including medical records, claims information, prescriptions, treatments, Social Security numbers, were exposed. - Root cause: Phishing attack
#### Kaseya:
A vulnerability in a platform developed by IT services provider Kaseya was exploited in order to hit an estimated 800 - 1500 customers, including MSPs. It is believed that attackers carried out a supply chain ransomware attack by leveraging a vulnerability in Kaseya’s VSA software against multiple managed service providers (MSP) and their customers. – Root Cause: Supply chain attack
> “Many attacks in 2021 were attributed to weaknesses such as exposed remote login or exposed data stores.”

### Breaches of note and root causes of 2021
#### Volkswagen, Audi:
The car manufacturers disclosed a data breach impacting over 3.3 million customers, the majority of which were based in the United States. It occurred between August 2019 and May 2021. Audi and Volkswagen customer data was being sold on a hacking forum after being stolen from an exposed Azure BLOB container. – Root Cause: Exposed Database
#### Colonial Pipeline:
The fuel pipeline operator was struck by ransomware, via the DarkSide cyber criminal collective. This resulted in fuel delivery disruption and panic buying across the United States. The company paid a ransom. The weakness was an exposed legacy VPN service, with only single-factor authentication. – Root Cause: Exposed Remote Access Service
#### Facebook:
A data dump of information belonging to over 550 million Facebook users was published online. Facebook IDs, names, dates of birth, genders, locations, and relationship statuses were included in the logs, of which Facebook (now known as Meta) said was collected via scraping in 2019. – Root Cause: Unprotected personal data.
#### CNA Financial:
75,000 individuals impacted. CNA Financial employees were unable to access corporate systems and were locked out following a ransomware attack which also involved the theft of internal data. The company paid a $40 million ransom. They were attacked via Phoenix Cryptolocker Ransomware. - Root Cause: Exposed Remote Access Service
#### OneMoreLead:
Number of individuals impacted 63 Million. OneMoreLead used an exposed database to store the personal and professional information for to at least 63 million people. – Root Cause: Exposed Database
#### Microsoft Exchange Server:
Over 30,000 organizations across the United States impacted. Widespread compromise of Microsoft Exchange servers caused by a set of zero-day vulnerabilities known as ProxyLogon leveraging CVE-2021-26855,. Microsoft became aware of the flaws in January and released emergency patches in March. - Root Cause: Remote Code Execution / Server Side Request Forgery

## Edgescan Metrics
### How we get the numbers
The statistics below are based on the full stack assessment of tens of thousands of individual assets during 2021.
This included over 40,000 web application and API assessments, 3 million Network Endpoint assessments and circa 1000 penetration tests delivered in 2021 by the edgescan team.
40% of Edgescan clients leverage on-demand Penetration Testing as a Service (PTaaS)
65% of clients regularly request “Retest on-demand” to rapidly validate and close code, configuration and patching fixes.
Clients save an average of 4 hours per application per month in time saved with this approach resulting in more rapid mitigation.
> “We have observed that the convergence of Attack Surface Management (ASM), Full stack vulnerability management and Penetration Testing as a Service (PTaaS) into a singular platform, has resulted in better visibility and increased response rates to discovered vulnerabilities.” – Ciaran Byrne, Head of Operations.

## Risk Density
### Risks Across the Full Stack
> “Continuous improvement is better than delayed perfection”
> Mark Twain

The following is a breakdown of the risks discovered across the full stack, Web applications and Network/Hosts. It also depicts the risks associated with potential PCI (Payment Card Industry) failures – Not every vulnerability results in a PCI fail. Across the full stack, 20.4% of all discovered vulnerabilities in 2021 were either High or Critical risk weaknesses. 9% of all Web Application vulnerabilities were either High or Critical Weaknesses. In the end, 16.8% of all Network/Host vulnerabilities were either High or Critical Risk.

![Image description](Full Stack Vulnerability Risk)
PCI Failures: 86.3%
- 5.5% Critical
- 14.9% High
- 15.4% Low
- 64.1% Medium

The “Full stack” includes both web application, API & Network vulnerabilities discovered. We don’t believe in silos of risk given cyber criminals don’t either.

![Image description](Full Stack Vulnerability Risk)
PCI Failures: 86.3%
- 6.1% Critical
- 16.4% High
- 3.6% Low
- 72.9% Medium

Definition of a High Risk Vulnerability: “Exploitation of the vulnerability likely results in significant compromise of services or data. Exploitation takes expertise in the sense that the attacker may need to be experienced. Likelihood of exploitation is generally high.
Definition of a Critical Risk Vulnerability: “Exploitation of the vulnerability likely results in complete compromise of services or data. Exploitation is relatively trivial in the sense that the attacker does not need any special authentication credentials or knowledge about the system to initially exploit a system. Likelihood of exploitation is generally very high”
Edgescan depicts risk via the typical “Info/Low/Medium/High” risk nomenclature (similar to the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology) and also via CVSS Score. CVSS scores may not always be accurate due to not taking the context of a vulnerability into account.

### How we measure Risk
Out of all vulnerabilities found on the full stack, 86.3% resulted in PCI Failures.

## Risk Density
### Risks Across the Web Application and Network Layer
#### Web Application
![Image description](Web Application Vulnerability Risk)
PCI Failures: 59%
- 4.6% Critical
- 4.4% High
- 53.7% Low
- 37.4% Medium

#### Network
![Image description](Network Vulnerability Risk)
PCI Failures: 68%
- 8% Critical
- 7% High
- 85% Low
- 62% Medium

![Image description](Web Application Vulnerability Risk)
PCI Failures: 59%
- 4.3% Critical
- 12.5% High
- 8% Low
- 52% Medium

![Image description](Network Vulnerability Risk)
PCI Failures: 68%
- 6% Critical
- 17.4% High
- 1.9% Low
- 74.7% Medium

Web Application Layer risks cover Web applications, API’s, Mobile apps and systems developed by bespoke development teams. The risks are primarily due to coding bugs. They generally have a CWE but not a CVE as the systems are not commodity items.
When we talk about “Network” risks we really mean device, servers and systems which require patching or confirguration. Most issues raised have an associated CVE or known configuration fix and are not “developer” code related issues (even though ultimately everything is just software!).
Looking at both the Web Application and Network Layer, we can see that web applications have more critical vulnerabilities but also have more lower risk vulnerbilities. On the Network layer, the focus is mainly around both High and Medium risk vulnerabilities which are more common.

Out of all vulnerabilities found on the Web Application layer, 59% resulted in PCI Failures.
Out of all vulnerabilities found on the Network layer, 68% resulted in PCI Failures.

## Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) Vulnerabilities
### Time it takes to fix Vulnerabilities across the Full Stack
The measurements below include remediation and verification that the fixes are robust (including reassessments & retesting). Mean time to Remediate (i.e. acode fix) for a critical risk on the web application/API layer is 47.6 days. Mean time to Remediate (i.e. patch or reconfigure) a device/host layer critical risk is 61.4 days. The quickest remediation on a vulnerability that was found was 0.5 days.

![Image description](Full Stack MTTR)
- 51.4 days Info
- 63.2 days Low Risk
- 59.8 days Medium
- 56.2 days High Risk
- 57.5 days Average MTTR
- 60 days Critical

Informational risks are commonly risk accepted resulting in an MTTR of 51.4 days. As an industry we need to improve the MTTR for high and critical risks.

## Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) Vulnerabilities
### Looking at Web App/API & Device/Host Layer
#### Web App/API Layer
![Image description](Web App/API Layer MTTR)
- 79.4 days Info
- 58.3 days Low Risk
- 68.4 days Medium
- 61.4 days High Risk
- 47.6 days Critical Risk
- 63.8 days Average MTTR

#### Device/Host Layer
![Image description](Device/Host Layer MTTR)
- 50.7 days Info
- 65.4 days Low Risk
- 59.4 days Medium
- 56 days High Risk
- 61.4 days Critical Risk
- 57 days Average MTTR

Looking now to both the Web App/API & Device/Host layers, we can see a big difference on the web/app layer compared to the Device/Host layer. In particular that the length of time to remediate on the Web App/API layer is 63.8 days compared to the average of 57 days on the Device/Host layer.
The average time to fix a Critical Risk issue, comes in at only 47.6 days, which shows that organisations are focusing on prioritising fixing vulnerabilities in the application layer. This is overshadowed however by both the Medium and High Risks which come in at 68.4 Days and 61.4 Days respectfully.
The Device/Host layer has the lowest average MTTR of 57 days, but it also has the highest MTTR for Critical risks of 61.4 Days.

## MTTR by Industry
### Industry Mean Time to Remediate Vulnerabilities
Through the Edgescan platform, we examined ten different industries to report on their average rates of MTTR within that industry. We can see that the shortest MTTR can be seen in Healthcare (NAICS 62) while the longest is Public Administration (NAICS 92). The second longest MTTR is seen to be manufacturing (NAICS 31-33) with an average of 78 days. This means that both Public Administration and Manufacturing take approximately double the length of time compared to the Healthcare industry, to fix vulnerabilities.

*The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is the standard used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy. - https://www.naics.com/

- Healthcare (NAICS 62) 44 days
- Accomindation & Food Services (NAICS 72) 64 days
- Education Services (NAICS 61) 51 days
- Professional, Scientific & Technical Services (NAICS 54) 68 days
- Arts, Entertainment and Recreation (NAICS 71) 58 days
- Financial & Insurance (NAICS 52) 48 days
- Public Administration (NAICS* 92) 92 days
- Information (NAICS 51) 61 days
- Manufacturing (NAICS 31-33) 78 days
- Retail (NAICS 44-45) 47 days

## MTTR by Region
### Region Mean Time to Remediate Vulnerabilities
As we can see from the above figures, the North America region has the highest MTTR for companies with an average of 59 days while Europe (EMEA) has an average of 56 days.
This gives us a global MTTR average of 57.5 Days for companies to fix their vulnerabilities.

- North America 59 Days
- Europe (EMEA) 56 Days
- Asia-Pacific 58 Days

## MTTR Based on Company Size
### Company Mean Time to Remediate Vulnerabilities
We believe the size of an organization does not impact speed of security.
It appears that company size generally has little or no impact in relation to the time it takes to fix vulnerabilities, similar to the 2021 report. We measured time-to-fix for critical risk vulnerabilities for a number of company sizes and the average is much the same across these organizations.
IT and Information Security generally does not grow linearly with the size of a business.
Larger organizations have more to secure, more data and systems, but generally not relatively more security staff!

- Staff Count: 11-100 68 Days
- Staff Count: 101-1000 61 Days
- Staff Count: 1001-10000 75 Days
- Staff Count: 10000+ 84 Days

## Vulnerability Age
### Full Stack
> “If you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you’ve always got.”
> Henry Ford

Over 16% of discovered vulnerabilities are from 2016. Circa 17% of vulnerabilities are older than 5 years old with 57% of discovered vulnerabilities are more than 2 years old. We can see that most common CVE in 2021: CVE-2015-4000 at 8.25% is “Logjam” while the most common CWE in 2021: CWE-310 at 21.31% is “Cryptographic Issues”.

![Image description](Vulnerability Age)

One common theme that we find each year, is the prevalence of ‘older’ known vulnerabilities that are found. This section highlights the age of known vulnerabilities that were found in a system during 2021. All of these issues already have patches available to address them. We can see 57% of such issues could be considered old – issues that range from being first discovered back in 1999, right up to recent years!

## Most Common Critical & High Risk API Vulnerabilities
This examines the most common high and critical risk API issues discovered in 2021 – those with a CVSS score of 7.0 and above. The percentage stated is the rate of occurrence compared to all critical risk vulnerabilities discovered in 2021.
Edgescan validates vulnerabilities based on context of the unique issue and does not always tally with CVSS scoring.
Many API vulnerabilities are similar to Web application vulnerabilities but the devil is in the detail; It appears to be more common to have issues regarding Rate Limiting requests, Direct object access (IDOR) and Authorization issues.
When developing API’s it’s assumed the “client” is not a person directly but another piece of software (e.g. website, app etc). This may give rise to a false sense of security because users do not directly interact with the API and the exposed features are hidden.

| Name | Vulnerability References & Notes | CWE/OWASP | % of Discovered Vulnerabilities |
|---|---|---|---|
| Injection Attacks | SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, OS Injections, Code Injections, ORM based vulnerabilities, Parsers such as XMLTraversal based attacks. | CWE-79, CWE-725, API8:2019 | 19.3% |
| Lack of resources and rate limiting | The API does not restrict the number or frequency of requests from a particular API client. This can be abused to make thousands of API calls per second, or request hundred or thousands of data records at once, resulting in a Denial of Service condition. This weakness also enables arbitrary scraping of other parties API’s and violate fair usage agreements. | CWE-770 / API4:2019 | 17.0% |
| Broken authentication | Weak authentication allowing compromise of authentication tokens or exploitation of common implementation flaws to assume other users identity or bypass authentication completely. Compromising a system’s ability to identify the client/user, compromises API security overall. | API2:2019/CWE-287 | 15.3% |
| Broken object level authorization (BOLA) | AKA Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). As its name implies, the ability to directly access resources without privileges or authorization. | CWE-639 / API1:2019 | 15.0% |
| Excessive data exposure (Information disclosure) | Exposure of all object properties of an API endpoint without consideration for use-case or requirement. Results in the reliance on API clients to perform the data filtering before displaying it to the user. | CWE-22, CWE-23, CWE-200,CWE-269, CWE-250 / API3:2019 | 12.9% |
| Mass assignment | API does not control which object attributes can be modified providing the potential for access to opaque data, outcomes or functions. This can be used to create new parameters that were never intended which in turn creates or overwrites new variable or objects in program code. | CWE-915 / API6:2019 | 10.6% |
| Broken function level authorization | Admin or sensitive functions exposed in error to unauthorized clients resulting in data disclosure or privileged execution for unauthorized API clients. In effect resulting in an overly large attack surface and unintended exposure risk. | CWE-285 / API5:2019 | 9.9% |

## Most Common Critical Risk Vulnerabilities
### Web Applications
The Application Security Critical Risk Top 10 depicts the most common critical risk issues discovered by Edgescan in 2021.
SQL Injection is still the main contender which is interesting to note as we can easily develop code which is not vulnerable to such attacks.
Something which is overlooked quite frequently is malicious file uploads. This can give rise to ransomware, malware and internal network breach pivot points for attackers.
Executable code injection is commonly used by exploit kits to get access to data and the source code of a system. The root cause is due to a system interpreting data as code and executing it.
Authorization issues cover privilege escalation or access to restricted functionality which would result in a data breach.

| Name | Vulnerability References & Notes | CWE | % of discovered Vulnerabilities |
|---|---|---|---|
| SQL Injection | Data extraction, manipulation and database access via injection attack. | CWE-89 | 33.0% |
| Cross Site Scripting (Reflected & Stored) | The XSS risk is based on context of where the vulnerability was discovered. | CWE-79, CWE-725 | 26.7% |
| XML external entity injection (XXE) | XML injection which resulted in application compromise or forcing the application to perform functions not intended. | CWE-611, CWE-1030 | 8.1% |
| Malicious File Upload | Potential for malware, Trojan, DoS (Large) upload via upload functionality. | CWE-434 | 7.0% |
| Server-Side Request Forgery | Induce the backend application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker’s choosing. | CWE-918 | 5.3% |
| Server-side template injection | Injection of malicious input into a template to execute commands on the backend system | CWE-1336 | 4.6% |
| Authorisation Issue | Bypassing controls to access data and functions without authorization. Horizontal and vertical privilege escalation is included in this category | CWE-285 | 7.0% |
| OS Command Injection | Ability to execute arbitrary system commands on the attacked party’s host operating system (OS) | CWE-78 | 3.9% |
| File path traversal / Information disclosure | Vulnerability that allows one to read arbitrary files on the server and disclose potentially sensitive information. | CWE-22, CWE-23, CWE-200 | 2.5% |
| Executable Code injection | Malicious injection or introduction of code into an application which can be executed in the context of the system being breached. | CWE-94,CWE-96, CWE-78 | 2.1% |

![Image description](Web Application Critical Vulnerabilities)

## Most Common High Risk Vulnerabilities
### Web Applications
As in previous years, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (49.8%) is still king of the hill for High risk issues. This can be used for phishing attacks, redirection to malicious sites, malware proliferation, but to name a few. Think of XSS as a payload delivery vulnerability.
Broken Authentication (22.1%) is high on the list for 2021. This relates to misconfiguration, broken logic, username enumeration or insecure authentication functionality.
XML external entity injection (2.3%) (also known as XXE) is lower than last year (4.7%). It is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate an applications processing of XML data. By virtue of injecting specific payloads, it can allow an attacker to do things such as gain unauthorized access to files on the application server filesystem or interact with downstream back-end/external systems that the application itself can access. In the case of these high risks, the XXE in question would result in system compromise and data exfiltration.

| Name | Vulnerability References & Notes | CWE | % of discovered Vulnerabilities |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cross-Site Scripting - XSS (reflected) | Context of where the XSS was discovered deemed the risk to be high. In many cases XSS is a medium risk due to evolving built-in web browser controls. | CWE-79, CWE-725 | 49.8% |
| Broken Authentication/Poor Session Management, Brute Forcing Possible | Broken CAPTCHA, Bypass, Insecure Authentication, Weak Password, Username Enumeration, Unencrypted Authentication. Lack of MFA, No Lockout controls or alerting. | CWE-287 | 22.1% |
| File path traversal/Information disclosure/Source Code Disclosure | Vulnerability that allows one to read arbitrary files on the server and disclose potentially sensitive information. | CWE-22, CWE-23, CWE-200, CWE-269, CWE-250 | 6.9% |
| Authorisation Issue - Privilege Escalation | Business logic and authorization access escalation. | CWE-285 | 6.0% |
| File path traversal/Direct Object Access | Direct access to assets without requirement for authorization or authentication | CWE-22, CWE-23, CWE-200 | 5.1% |
| Malicious File Upload | Potential for malware, Trojan, DoS (Large) upload via upload functionality. | CWE-434 | 3.2% |
| Deserialization Attacks | Insecure deserialization is when user-controllable data is deserialized by a website. Results in manipulation of serialized objects in order to pass harmful data into the application. | CWE-502 | 3.2% |
| Executable Code injection | Malicious injection or introduction of code into an application which can be executed in the context the system being breached | CWE-94,CWE-96, CWE-78 | 2.8% |
| XML External Entity Injection (XXE) | XML injection which resulted in application compromise or forcing the application to perform functions not intended. | CWE-611, CWE-1030 | 2.3% |
| Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | Induce the backend application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attackers choosing. | CWE-918 | 1.8% |

## CVE & CWE
### The Evolving Landscape
> “Weak Crypto is king of the hill.”
> Eoin Keary

## Most Common CVE discovered in 2021
The mission of the CVE® Program is to identify, define, and catalog publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities. There is one CVE Record for each vulnerability in the catalog. The vulnerabilities are discovered then assigned and published by organizations from around the world that have partnered with the CVE Program.
The CVE age-landscape is always an interesting one each year. This list represents the most common known vulnerabilities found in 2021 and include one high risk and 3 medium risk issues. The most concerning trend here, is the actual age of these issues – most were first reported six or seven years ago and one right back to 2003! Also, it is no surprise that the majority of these issues are related to some kind of crypto weakness.
- CVE-2015-4000: TLS man-in-the-middle. An Attacker can conduct a cipher-downgrade, aka the “Logjam“.
- CVE-2015-2808: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, does not properly combine state data with key data during the initialization phase, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks, aka the “Bar Mitzvah” issue.
- CVE-2013-2566: The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, has many single-byte biases, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of ciphertext in a large number of sessions that use the same plaintext.
- CVE-2016-2183: The DES and Triple DES ciphers, as used in the TLS, SSH, and IPsec protocols and other protocols and products, have a weakness which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack, aka a “Sweet32” attack.
- CVE-2003-0661: The NetBT Name Service (NBNS) for NetBIOS in Windows NT 4.0, 2000, XP, and Server 2003 may include random memory in a response to a NBNS query, which could allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information.
- CVE-2014-3566: The SSL protocol 3.
