## Introduction

For our 7th Year running, welcome to the Edgescan Vulnerability Stats Report 2022. This report aims to
demonstrate the state of full stack security based on thousands of security assessments and penetration tests
performed globally, as delivered by the Edgescan SaaS during 2021.

Compiling this report and delving into the underlying data is still a joy as it let us understand the true state of
cyber posture based on thousands of assessments and penetration tests. It gives unique insight into what’s
going on from a trends and statistics perspective and indeed a snapshot of the overall state of cyber security.

The Edgescan report has become a reliable source for truly representing the global state of cyber security
vulnerability management. This is becoming more evident as our unique dataset is now also part of other annual
security analysis reports, such as the Verizon DBIR (we are happy contributors for many years now).

This year we examined vulnerability metrics from a known vulnerability (CVE), Malware, Ransomware and
visibility standpoint (exposed services), coupling both internal and public Internet-facing systems. We also take
a look at how quick we are fixing various vulnerabilities based on risk.

We still see high rates of known (i.e. patchable) vulnerabilities, which have working exploits in the wild, used by
known nation state and cyber criminal groups.

We also decided to look at the state of cyber posture from an ASM (Attack Surface Management) standpoint.
Exposed services are a real risk. Statistically some of the exposures have a very low percentage but many of
them would result in a breach.

Remote access exposures across the attack surface are a worrying trend and accounted for 5% of total
exposures in 2021.

So yes, patching and maintenance is still a challenge, demonstrating that it is not trivial to patch production
systems. The MTTR (Mean Time to Remediation) stats also reflect on this issue. Detection on a constant basis
needs improvement and as I’ve always said, visibility is paramount. The web application layer is where the
majority of risk still resides, but some lower layer (Host/Operating system/Protocol) issues, if discovered, could
also present headaches if exploited. CVE’s as old as 2015 are being used by ransomware and malware toolkits
to exploit systems within “the perimeter“.

Attack Surface Management (Visibility) is a key driver to cyber security and based on our continuous asset
profiling, we discuss how common sensitive and critical systems are exposed to the public Internet. The
assumption here is that enterprises simply did not have the visibility or systems in place, to make them aware
of, or inform them of the exposure.

This report provides a glimpse of a global snapshot across dozens of industry verticals and how to prioritize on
what is important, as not all vulnerabilities are equal. We call out which threat actors are leveraging discovered
vulnerabilities, which should be food for thought.

This year we included a section on API security based on the assessment of thousands of API’s in 2021. We list
the Top API vulnerabilities and frequency of such.

Best Regards

## 2021 Year in Review

### Breaches of note and root causes of 2021

#### Log4j:

(CVE-2021-44228 – CVSS Score: 10) A zero-day vulnerability in the Log4j Java
library, a remote code execution (RCE) flaw, has now been actively exploited in the
wild since December 2021. The vulnerability is known as Log4Shell and is now being
weaponized by botnets, including Mirai, CONTI, Konsari, and TellYouThePass groups,
currently leveraging it in their campaigns. See https://www.edgescan.com/log4shell-
quick-script/ for technical guidance. – Root cause: Remote Code Injection

#### Bitmart:

In December, Bitmart said a security breach permitted cyberattackers to steal circa
$150 million in cryptocurrency, with total losses including damages, to reach $200
million. Criminals stole various crypto tokens on December 4, after using a stolen
privacy key to gain access to one of BitMart’s hot wallets. – Root cause: Stolen
authentication credentials

#### Robinhood:

Number Of Individuals Impacted: 7 million. Robinhood disclosed a data breach
impacting five million users of the app. Email addresses, names, phone numbers,
and more were accessed via a customer support system. For the vast majority of
affected customers, the only information obtained was an email address or a full
name. For 310 people, the information taken included their name, date of birth, and
ZIP code. Of those, 10 customers had “more extensive account details revealed,”
Robinhood said in a statement. - Root cause: customer-service reps were socially
engineered into sharing information

#### UC San Diego Health:

UC San Diego Health said employee email accounts were compromised by
criminals, leading to an exposure. Patient, student and employee data
potentially including medical records, claims information, prescriptions,
treatments, Social Security numbers, were exposed. - Root cause: Phishing attack

#### Kaseya:

A vulnerability in a platform developed by IT services provider Kaseya was
exploited in order to hit an estimated 800 - 1500 customers, including MSPs. It is
believed that attackers carried out a supply chain ransomware attack by leveraging
a vulnerability in Kaseya’s VSA software against multiple managed service providers
(MSP) and their customers. – Root Cause: Supply chain attack

> “Many attacks in 2021 were attributed to weaknesses such
> as exposed remote login or exposed data stores.”

### 2021 Year in Review

#### Breaches of note and root causes of 2021

#### Volkswagen, Audi:

The car manufacturers disclosed a data breach impacting over 3.3 million
customers, the majority of which were based in the United States. It
occurred between August 2019 and May 2021. Audi and Volkswagen
customer data was being sold on a hacking forum after being stolen from
an exposed Azure BLOB container. – Root Cause: Exposed Database

#### Colonial Pipeline:

The fuel pipeline operator was struck by ransomware, via the DarkSide
cyber criminal collective. This resulted in fuel delivery disruption and panic
buying across the United States. The company paid a ransom. The
weakness was an exposed legacy VPN service, with only single-factor
authentication. – Root Cause: Exposed Remote Access Service

#### Facebook:

A data dump of information belonging to over 550 million Facebook users
was published online. Facebook IDs, names, dates of birth, genders,
locations, and relationship statuses were included in the logs, of which
Facebook (now known as Meta) said was collected via scraping in 2019. –
Root Cause: Unprotected personal data.

#### CNA Financial:

75,000 individuals impacted. CNA Financial employees were unable to
access corporate systems and were locked out following a ransomware
attack which also involved the theft of internal data. The company paid a
$40 million ransom. They were attacked via Phoenix Cryptolocker
Ransomware. - Root Cause: Exposed Remote Access Service

#### OneMoreLead:

Number of individuals impacted 63 Million. OneMoreLead used an exposed
database to store the personal and professional information for to at least
63 million people. – Root Cause: Exposed Database

#### Microsoft Exchange Server:

Over 30,000 organizations across the United States impacted. Widespread
compromise of Microsoft Exchange servers caused by a set of zero-day
vulnerabilities known as ProxyLogon leveraging CVE-2021-26855,. Microsoft
became aware of the flaws in January and released emergency patches in
March. - Root Cause: Remote Code Execution / Server Side Request
Forgery

## Edgescan Metrics

The statistics below are based on the full stack assessment of tens of thousands of individual assets during
2021.

This included over 40,000 web application and API assessments, 3 million Network Endpoint assessments and
circa 1000 penetration tests delivered in 2021 by the edgescan team.

40% of Edgescan clients leverage on-demand Penetration Testing as a Service (PTaaS)

65% of clients regularly request “Retest on-demand” to rapidly validate and close code, configuration and
patching fixes.

Clients save an average of 4 hours per application per month in time saved with this approach resulting in
more rapid mitigation.

## Risk Density

### Risks Across the Full Stack

> “Continuous improvement is better than delayed perfection”
> Mark Twain

The following is a breakdown of the risks discovered across the full stack, Web applications and Network/Hosts. It
also depicts the risks associated with potential PCI (Payment Card Industry) failures – Not every vulnerability
results in a PCI fail. Across the full stack, 20.4% of all discovered vulnerabilities in 2021 were either High or Critical
risk weaknesses. 9% of all Web Application vulnerabilities were either High or Critical Weaknesses. In the end,
16.8% of all Network/Host vulnerabilities were either High or Critical Risk.

*   **Full Stack Vulnerability Risk**
    *   5.5% Critical
    *   14.9% High
    *   15.4% Low
    *   64.1% Medium
    *   PCI Failures: 86.3%

The “Full stack” includes both web application, API &
Network vulnerabilities discovered. We don’t believe
in silos of risk given cyber criminals don’t either.

**Definition of a High Risk Vulnerability:** “Exploitation of the vulnerability likely results in significant compromise
of services or data. Exploitation takes expertise in the sense that the attacker may need to be experienced.
Likelihood of exploitation is generally high.

**Definition of a Critical Risk Vulnerability:** “Exploitation of the vulnerability likely results in complete compromise
of services or data. Exploitation is relatively trivial in the sense that the attacker does not need any special
authentication credentials or knowledge about the system to initially exploit a system. Likelihood of exploitation
is generally very high”

Edgescan depicts risk via the typical “Info/Low/Medium/High” risk nomenclature (similar to the OWASP Risk
Rating Methodology) and also via CVSS Score. CVSS scores may not always be accurate due to not taking the
context of a vulnerability into account.

**How we measure Risk**

Out of all vulnerabilities found on the full stack,
86.3% resulted in PCI Failures.

### Risk Density

#### Risks Across the Web Application and Network Layer

*   **Web Application Vulnerability Risk**
    *   4.6% Critical
    *   4.4% High
    *   53.7% Low
    *   37.4% Medium
    *   PCI Failures: 59%
*   **Network Vulnerability Risk**
    *   8% Critical
    *   7% High
    *   85% Low
    *   62% Medium
    *   PCI Failures: 68%

*   *Web Application Layer risks cover Web applications, API’s, Mobile apps and systems developed by bespoke development teams. The risks are primarily due to coding bugs. They generally have a CWE but not a CVE as the systems are not commodity items.*
*   *When we talk about “Network” risks we really mean device, servers and systems which require patching or confirguration. Most issues raised have an associated CVE or known configuration fix and are not “developer” code related issues (even though ultimately everything is just software!).*

Looking at both the Web Application and Network Layer, we can see that web applications have more critical
vulnerabilities but also have more lower risk vulnerbilities. On the Network layer, the focus is mainly around
both High and Medium risk vulnerabilities which are more common.

Out of all vulnerabilities found on the Web
Application layer, 59% resulted in PCI Failures.

Out of all vulnerabilities found on the Network layer,
68% resulted in PCI Failures.

## Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) Vulnerabilities

### Time it takes to fix Vulnerabilities across the Full Stack

The measurements below include remediation and verification that the fixes are robust (including reassessments
& retesting). Mean time to Remediate (i.e. acode fix) for a critical risk on the web application/API layer is 47.6 days.
Mean time to Remediate (i.e. patch or reconfigure) a device/host layer critical risk is 61.4 days. The quickest
remediation on a vulnerability that was found was 0.5 days.

*   **Full Stack**
    *   Informational: 51.4 days
    *   Low Risk: 63.2 days
    *   Medium: 59.8 days
    *   High Risk: 56.2 days
    *   Critical: 57.5 days
    *   Average MTTR: 60 days

Informational risks are commonly risk accepted resulting in an MTTR of 51.4 days. As an industry we need to
improve the MTTR for high and critical risks.

### Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) Vulnerabilities

#### Looking at Web App/API & Device/Host Layer

*   **Web App/API Layer**
    *   Informational: 79.4 days
    *   Low Risk: 58.3 days
    *   Medium: 68.4 days
    *   High Risk: 61.4 days
    *   Critical Risk: 47.6 days
    *   Average MTTR: 63.8 days
*   **Device/Host Layer**
    *   Informational: 50.7 days
    *   Low Risk: 65.4 days
    *   Medium: 59.4 days
    *   High Risk: 56 days
    *   Critical Risk: 61.4 days
    *   Average MTTR: 57 days

Looking now to both the Web App/API & Device/Host layers, we can see a big difference on the web/app layer
compared to the Device/Host layer. In particular that the length of time to remediate on the Web App/API layer
is 63.8 days compared to the average of 57 days on the Device/Host layer.

The average time to fix a Critical Risk issue, comes in at only 47.6 days, which shows that organisations are
focusing on prioritising fixing vulnerabilities in the application layer. This is overshadowed however by both the
Medium and High Risks which come in at 68.4 Days and 61.4 Days respectfully.

The Device/Host layer has the lowest average MTTR of 57 days, but it also has the highest MTTR for Critical
risks of 61.4 Days.

## MTTR by Industry

### Industry Mean Time to Remediate Vulnerabilities

Through the Edgescan platform, we examined ten different industries to report on their average rates
of MTTR within that industry. We can see that the shortest MTTR can be seen in Healthcare (NAICS 62)
while the longest is Public Administration (NAICS 92). The second longest MTTR is seen to be
manufacturing (NAICS 31-33) with an average of 78 days. This means that both Public Administration
and Manufacturing take approximately double the length of time compared to the Healthcare industry,
to fix vulnerabilities.

\*The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is the standard used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for
the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy. - https://www.naics.com/

*   Healthcare (NAICS 62): 44 days
*   Accomindation & Food Services (NAICS 72): 64 days
*   Education Services (NAICS 61): 51 days
*   Professional, Scientific & Technical Services (NAICS 54): 68 days
*   Arts, Entertainment and Recreation (NAICS 71): 58 days
*   Financial & Insurance (NAICS 52): 48 days
*   Public Administration (NAICS\* 92): 92 days
*   Information (NAICS 51): 61 days
*   Manufacturing (NAICS 31-33): 78 days
*   Retail (NAICS 44-45): 47 days

## MTTR by Region

### Region Mean Time to Remediate Vulnerabilities

As we can see from the above figures, the North America region has the highest MTTR for companies
with an average of 59 days while Europe (EMEA) has an average of 56 days.

This gives us a global MTTR average of 57.5 Days for companies to fix their vulnerabilities.

*   North America: 59 Days
*   Europe (EMEA): 56 Days
*   Asia-Pacific: 58 Days

## MTTR Based on Company Size

### Company Mean Time to Remediate Vulnerabilities

We believe the size of an organization does not impact speed of security.

It appears that company size generally has little or no impact in relation to the time it takes to fix
vulnerabilities, similar to the 2021 report. We measured time-to-fix for critical risk vulnerabilities for a number
of company sizes and the average is much the same across these organizations.

IT and Information Security generally does not grow linearly with the size of a business.

Larger organizations have more to secure, more data and systems, but generally not relatively more security
staff!

*   Staff Count: 11-100: 68 Days
*   Staff Count: 101-1000: 61 Days
*   Staff Count: 1001-10000: 75 Days
*   Staff Count: 10000+: 84 Days

## Vulnerability Age

### Full Stack

> “If you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you’ve always got.”
> Henry Ford

Over 16% of discovered vulnerabilities are from 2016. Circa 17% of vulnerabilities are older than 5 years old with
57% of discovered vulnerabilities are more than 2 years old. We can see that most common CVE in 2021: CVE-
2015-4000 at 8.25% is “Logjam” while the most common CWE in 2021: CWE-310 at 21.31% is “Cryptographic
Issues”.

*   **% of all discovered CVE’s**
    *   2021: 26.2%
    *   2020: 18.2%
    *   2019: 9.9%
    *   2018: 6.7%
    *   2017: 7.4%
    *   2016: 16.2%
    *   2015: 7.8%
    *   2014: 2.7%
    *   2013: 0.3%
    *   2012: 1.4%
    *   2011: 0.5%
    *   2010: 0.8%
    *   2009: 0.3%
    *   2008: 0.6%
    *   2007: 0.2%
    *   2006: 0%
    *   2005: 0%
    *   2004: 0%
    *   2003: 0.1%
    *   2002: 0%
    *   2001: 0.1%
    *   2000: 1.5%
    *   1999: 0%

One common theme that we find each year, is the prevalence of ‘older’ known vulnerabilities that are found.
This section highlights the age of known vulnerabilities that were found in a system during 2021. All of these
issues already have patches available to address them. We can see 57% of such issues could be considered old
– issues that range from being first discovered back in 1999, right up to recent years!

## Most Common Critical & High Risk API Vulnerabilities

This examines the most common high and critical
risk API issues discovered in 2021 – those with
a CVSS score of 7.0 and above. The percentage
stated is the rate of occurrence compared to all
critical risk vulnerabilities discovered in 2021.

Edgescan validates vulnerabilities based on
context of the unique issue and does not always
tally with CVSS scoring.

Many API vulnerabilities are similar to Web
application vulnerabilities but the devil is in the
detail; It appears to be more common to have
issues regarding Rate Limiting requests, Direct
object access (IDOR) and Authorization issues.

When developing API’s it’s assumed the “client” is
not a person directly but another piece of
software (e.g. website, app etc). This may give
rise to a false sense of security because users do
not directly interact with the API and the exposed
features are hidden.


