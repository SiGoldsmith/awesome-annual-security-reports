## Executive Summary
The 2022 Security Culture Report (SCR) is the largest, globally recognized research into security 
awareness, behavior and culture available. The SCR offers unique insights which allow organizational 
leaders to better understand how employees view security within their organizations. This information 
is also leveraged by business leaders to ensure necessary investment dollars are allocated to the 
most critical part of the security infrastructure: the human element.
The SCR provides a number of key resources essential in understanding and measuring an 
organization’s security culture.

### A Standard Way to Measure and Report
This report uses the globally recognized Security Culture Index. The use of a standard index offers 
direct value by allowing the reader to compare the information presented in a meaningful way. 
The index ranges are as follows: 
- 90 up to 100 Excellent
- 80 up to 89 Good
- 70 up to 79 Moderate
- 60 up to 69 Mediocre
- 0 up to 59 Poor
...Ensure necessary investment 
dollars are allocated to 
the most critical part of the 
security infrastructure: 
the human element.
To identify where on the index an organization belongs, the Security Culture Survey (SCS) is used. 
Leveraged by 2,910 companies worldwide, the SCS is the most comprehensive measurement 
instrument available to assess an organization’s security culture. 

### The Global Pandemic Improved Security Culture
The impact of the global pandemic showed that while some industry sectors have reduced their 
security culture significantly, others have improved. The most significant finding is that no industry is 
found to have Poor or Mediocre security culture scores. Although all industry sectors have a security 
culture that is considered Moderate, many of the industries include organizations that have been 
rated as Good.

### Security Culture Varies Around the World
Our results show that some regions and countries 
are reporting a much better security culture than 
others. A notable example is the United States 
of America, which generally trends higher on all 
aspects of security culture compared to other 
countries. Behind the USA is Europe, which has a 
much larger variation in security culture between 
countries, which results in a lower average. 
Africa, Asia and South America generally show 
a lower security culture, suggesting that more 
work is needed.
The impact of the global 
pandemic showed that 
while some industry sectors 
have reduced their security 
culture significantly, others 
have improved.

### Industry Benchmarking With Trends
In 2022, we have introduced new graphics to the industry benchmark to make it easier to review 
and process. The new trend graph places the current score into context. We also provide a 
breakdown based on organizational size, 
allowing you to more accurately assess where 
your organization sits. Additionally, each 
industry benchmark is presented on a single 
page, making it easy to print and share only 
the information you need. 

### Board Level Concern
Security culture has garnered attention from 
board-level executives. The SCR provides all 
levels of executives, management and practitioners with the necessary context and data to help 
navigate the complexity of security within their own organization. In the ever-increasing landscape 
of social engineering, and the challenge that the human factors bring to any organization today, 
it is critical that top-level management understand the risk and the impact that security awareness, 
behaviors and culture has.

### Defining Security Culture
It is important to note that the phrase “security culture” is beginning to find its way into the lexicon 
of security leaders. CISOs and security executives now commonly cite security culture as being 
a critical element of their security posture. But there is a problem—security leaders have vastly 
different definitions of security culture, meaning that they do not really know what they are all in 
agreement about. 
We define security culture as the ideas, customs and social behaviors that influence an organization’s 
security. A common definition makes it possible to discuss the same thing, in the same way. We all 
know that if you do not measure something, that something does not exist.
Security culture: The ideas, 
customs and social behaviors of 
an organization that influence 
their security.

## Introduction
The SCR is produced annually by KnowBe4 Research, allowing us to analyze the security culture 
of thousands of organizations globally. It is the largest report ever published on this topic, with an 
increasing data set year-over-year. The report offers the reader insight into the state of security 
measures and their impact, through the human factor’s lens. As such, this unique report offers 
important information to the global security industry and should be used by top management within 
an organization to inform their security program improvements for 2022.
The first SCR was published in 2017, by the Norwegian research company CLTRe. After being 
acquired by KnowBe4 in 2019, the research unit became KnowBe4 Research, and is considered 
the leading security culture research organization in the world.
In the 2022 report, we introduce several new sections. For the first time, we can present security 
culture trends, exploring how industries change over time. We also presented data that helped 
explain the impact of the pandemic, and that should be used to understand how your industry sector 
performs. Additionally, we have added a regional breakdown, where we offer two different views 
into security culture around the world: 1) general security culture; 2) the impact that organizational 
size has on security culture globally. 
The Security Culture Industry Benchmark offers a deep dive into each industry sector. We have made 
several changes to this section in this report, introducing trends and organizational size perspectives. 
The 2022 SCR is divided into the following sections: 
- Introduction
- What Is Security Culture—Definition of: security culture, 7 dimensions of security culture and 
the Security Culture Index
- A Global Perspective of Security Culture—Security culture as seen around the world. This section 
includes information on security culture based on organizational size and across regions.
- Security Culture Industry Trends—The evolution of security culture over time
- Industry Benchmark—Detailed information about each industry sector 
- Method—Shares data, tables and methodology 
- About—Information about the authors and KnowBe4 
This report is robust in offering a lot of industry relevant information that we are certain you will 
find value in.

### Changes in the Security Culture Report 2022
The following new sections have been added to the 2022 report:
- A Global Perspective on Security Culture—Regional data breakdown of Europe, USA, 
Canada and Latin America with regional map visualizations. This section also includes security 
culture as measured by organizational size – security culture and dimension scores by size of 
organizations: small, medium and large.
- Trends—How different industries have performed regarding security culture over the past two 
to three years. 
These new sections have one thing in common—the data is represented visually via graphs and 
maps. We believe visualizing the data makes the information easier to digest. However, if you prefer 
to see the actual numbers in table format, you can find this in the Methodology section.
To make space for all this new content, the Detailed Analysis of Security Culture section was removed. 
Our plans are to publish this type of analysis in a different report in the future. Additionally, the 
Comparing Dimensions Scores Across Industries section has been discontinued with the data now 
available on each industry page. 
Another change this year is the Industry Benchmark section. This year, the boxplots have been 
removed to allow space for trend data on all dimensions and an analysis of scores by organizational 
size. We are excited about this change, as it allows for a more detailed and long‑term perspective 
on security culture. For those still interested in the statistics associated with the boxplot, you can find 
these in the Methodology section.
Lastly, there have been some changes to the industries included in this year’s report.
- Internet and Software Services, which was previously in the Other category, is now in Technology.
- Hospitality, also in the Other category, is now an independent benchmark.
- SCS data where the industry is unknown has been removed and therefore has eliminated the 
Other category.
Our continuous content review and subsequent changes allow us to keep providing you with the 
most relevant and useful data available.

## Security Culture—A High‑Level Perspective
In this section, we offer a brief overview of what security culture is. 

### What Is Security Culture
We define security culture as: The ideas, customs and social behaviors that influence 
an organization’s security. 
This definition makes it clear that security culture is a combination of thought 
processes and knowledge, the habits that employees have adapted and the 
behaviors that are demonstrated when in the workplace. By workplace, 
we mean any such place where employees perform their work. We 
define security broadly. 
With this definition in mind, organizations should focus their 
efforts on a combination of employee engagement with 
assessments and training, improve process and procedures 
and by implementing technology that makes it easy 
for the employee to do the right thing. 
For more in-depth information on what 
security culture is, and how to successfully 
implement a security culture program at 
your organization, refer to The Security 
Culture Playbook, An Executive Guide 
To Reducing Risk and Developing 
Your Human Defense Layer by 
Perry Carpenter and Kai 
Roer (Wiley, 2022). 

### Security Culture Dimensions
We systematically evaluate culture across seven 
distinct dimensions:
- Attitudes: The feelings and beliefs that 
employees have toward the security 
protocols and issues.
- Behaviors: The actions and activities 
of employees that have direct or indirect 
impact on the security of the organization.
- Cognition: Employees’ understanding, 
knowledge and awareness of security 
issues and activities.
- Communication: The quality of 
communication channels to discuss security-
related topics, promote a sense of belonging 
and provide support for security issues and 
incident reporting.
- Compliance: The knowledge of written 
security policies and the extent that 
employees follow them.
- Norms: The knowledge of and adherence to 
unwritten rules of conduct in the organization.
- Responsibilities: How employees perceive 
their role as a critical factor in sustaining or 
endangering the security of the organization.

### Security Culture Index
The Security Culture Index (SCI) is the global 
index for rating organizations based on their 
security culture score. The index was created by 
the team of researchers at KnowBe4 Research 
and is calculated by analyzing the security 
culture of thousands of organizations around 
the world. More details on the index itself, and 
the direct risk attached to each level, can be 
found in the research paper Security Culture and 
Credential Sharing, available for download at: 
 https://get.clt.re/credential-sharing-research/
- 90 up to 100 Excellent
- 80 up to 89 Good
- 70 up to 79 Moderate
- 60 up to 69 Mediocre
- 0 up to 59 Poor
Note: None of the industry sectors have 
demonstrated Excellent or Good security 
culture this year.

### The Security Culture Maturity Model
The data-driven and evidence-based Security Culture Maturity Model, developed by KnowBe4 
Research, is the industry’s first maturity model specifically geared to measure security culture. The 
model is fueled by KnowBe4’s massive security awareness, behavior and culture dataset.

*The dashed red line represents breach likelihood and relative cost remediation
The solid blue line represents awareness/culture maturity gains at each stage of the model

Figure 1: Security Culture Maturity Model.

### The Five Maturity Levels
The model’s range accounts for organizations with no formal or intentional awareness, behavior or 
culture plan other than to achieve basic compliance (Level 1) all the way up to the most sophisticated 
organizations that seek to push beyond the pack and are actively working to shape even the 
unwritten rules and social dynamics of how their employees value security. Learn more about these 
levels below.
Level 1
Basic Compliance
Bare minimum of training
Limited metrics
“Check the box”
Level 2
Security Awareness 
Foundation
At least annual and onboarding training
Occasional phishing simulations
Focus on variety of content
Level 3

Awareness & Behavior
Intentional awareness program with integrated 
tools
Quarterly training with simulated phishing
Focus on security-aware behaviors
Level 4
Security Behavior 
Management
Continuous training across varied delivery 
methods and audiences
Heavy use of integrated tools to inform training 
strategy
Program focused on real behavior change
Level 5

reinforces security culture
Multiple methods of behavior-based 
encouragement
Security values woven through fabric of entire 
organization

## A Global Perspective on Security Culture
Measuring security culture is a global concern. 
Understanding the security culture of your 
workplace is proving increasingly important 
for the security posture of the organization. 
As we demonstrated in the 2021 SCR, 9/10 
global security leaders believe that security 
culture is a critical factor to their successful 
implementation of a security program. The 
gap between the acceptance of security 
culture being critical and the implementation 
of a security culture program, is demonstrated 
by the lack of data from many countries. 
Of particular interest, outside Europe and 
North America, we have noted a dramatic 
drop in organizations measuring security 
culture, leaving them blindsided when it comes 
to assessing the human factors of security. 
Below, we share regional breakdowns for your 
reference, but the important message is that 
organizations must step up their game and 
invest in security awareness, behavior and 
culture in the years to come. This is not a nice 
to have, it is a critical asset used to reduce risk 
and improve security. 
Security culture is found in every organization, 
all around the world. In this section, we are 
comparing security culture and commenting 
on the observations and measurements. When 
looking at security culture from a satellite 
perspective, the variation between regions is 
small, with only two points between the worst 
performing and the best performing. 

### Global Overview
![The global perspective of security culture](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 2: The global perspective of security culture.*
North America scored 74 (the best), with the rest of the world comparable to Europe and Asia 
scoring 73, and Latin America, Africa and Oceania scoring 72. 
This global overview easily gives a false understanding—that all regions perform similarly and that 
things are not too bad. But the reality is more nuanced, and shocking, than what the aggregated 
picture may indicate. That becomes clear as we dig into each of the regions. 
In the breakdown below, we use the same scale across all regions and countries, to make it easy 
to visually compare regions and countries. 
Sample sizes are not large enough to further break down the regions of Central and South America, 
Africa and Asia. These regions are lagging behind in security investments in general, and especially 
in security awareness, behavior and culture. In 2022, it is common knowledge that human factors 
have a dramatic impact on security, regardless of the geographical location of an organization. It 
is therefore our strong recommendation that organizations and nations around the world invest in 
programs and strategies to dramatically improve the assessment and training of employees.

### Security Culture According To Organizational Size Worldwide
In this section, we examine security culture based on organizational size:
- Large–1,000+ employees and are represented with the red line.
- Medium–250 to 1,000 employees and are shown with the green line.
- Small–less than 250 employees and are represented with the blue line.
We first show a global overview, before breaking it down into regions.
![Security culture by organizational size Global Overview](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 3: Security culture as seen by organizational size (Global overview).*
We see an interesting pattern emerge when examining the security culture 
scores globally. At first glance, it seems like security culture is similar regardless 
of the size of the organization. In addition, the two valleys in the graph are 
appearing in the same place: in the Cognition and the Responsibility dimensions. 
Upon closer inspection, we see that large organizations report better attitudes and 
behaviors than smaller organizations. This may be related to the fact that many 
larger organizations are likely to be publicly traded, and thus regulated. 
On the other hand, small organizations scored better on all other 
dimensions, something that is really visible on the Communication 
dimension, where the Large organizations scored five points 
less. Communication tends to be easier in smaller groups, 
and this is clearly demonstrated here.

### Security Culture in Africa
![Security culture score in Africa](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 4: Security culture score in Africa. The sample size varies from 
country to country. For more details, please refer to the method section.*
In Africa, there is a tradition and interest in security culture, especially in South Africa (73), where 
we expected a higher level of security culture than was achieved. In the other countries in Africa 
where we have data, we see very wide variations in security culture, which is likely explained by 
limited sample sizes. We expect to see more African countries measuring security culture in the 
future. In the meantime, we urge 
organizations and governments 
to focus on the human aspects of 
security and invest in education 
and training.
![Security culture in Africa as seen by organizational size](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 5: Security culture in Africa as seen by organizational size.*
In Africa, we see that Large organizations generally do better than others when it comes to security 
culture. There are two notable differences: the Cognition and Communication dimensions, where 
Small organizations perform much better than the others. Africa has a sample size of 52 organizations 
and 14,121 employees.

### Security Culture in Asia
![Security culture score in Asia](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 6: Security culture score in Asia. The sample size varies from country to 
country. For more details, please refer to the method section.*
In Asia, we see a wide variation of security culture scores across nations. While Japan (76) is doing 
reasonably well, countries like Malaysia (66) and Indonesia (67) show an alarmingly low security 
culture index score. Our general recommendation for organizations in Asia is to invest in security 
awareness, behavior and culture programs.
![Security culture in Asia as seen by organizational size](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 7: Security culture in Asia as seen by organizational size.*
In Asia, we see that organizational size is a smaller factor than in some other regions. With the 
exception of Medium organizations on the Attitudes and Behaviors dimensions, we see that the 
organizational size has little impact on security culture. Our findings may be skewed due to the 
comparably small sample size of 39 organizations and 15,095 employees across the continent.

### Security Culture in Europe
![Security culture score in Europe](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 8: Security culture score in Europe. The sample size 
varies from country to country. For more details, please refer 
to the method section.*
In Europe (73), we observe large 
variations in security culture between 
countries. The worst performing 
countries are Portugal (64), Latvia 
(66) and France (67). These results 
may be due to small sample sizes 
in these countries, suggesting that 
security measures in general are 
lacking. We urge these countries to 
implement measures to improve their 
security and reduce risk. 
On the more favorable end of the 
spectrum, we find Sweden (77) 
and Ireland (78), both often being 
considered technologically advanced. 
Along with them, we also find that 
Italy (77) and Bulgaria (79) score higher. Even so, no countries in Europe report a Good score on 
the Security Culture Index. Considering the ongoing geopolitical situation, our recommendations 
are that countries in Europe take action to improve their security culture by assessing their employees 
and implementing training and education programs to ensure the right security behaviors.
![Security culture in Europe as seen by organizational size](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 9: Security culture in Europe as seen by organizational size.*
Europe shows a relatively consistent variation across the size of organizations. The most notable difference 
is seen in the dimensions Communication and Compliance. Small organizations are dramatically better 
at communicating than other organizations. Large organizations score the highest when it comes to 
compliance. Europe has a sample size of 141 organizations and 30,016 employees.

### Security Culture in North America
![Security culture score in North America](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 10: Security culture score in North America. The sample size varies from 
country to country. For more details, please refer to the method section.*
The North American region in this report consists of the USA and Canada. As a region, North 
America is more favorable than the rest of the world, with an average score of 74. When looking at 
the region from a national perspective, we see that the region is showing differences in the security 
culture scores. Below, we break down the results according to state levels for the USA and Canada.
![Security culture in North America as seen by organizational size](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 11: Security culture in North America as seen by organizational size.*
Security culture in North America reflects small differences based on organizational size. The most 
notable differences are in the dimension of Communication, where Small organizations outperform 
the others. The other dimension that stands out is Behavior, where Large organizations perform 
better and Small organizations underperform. It is also worth noting that the North American and 
European security cultures follow a very similar pattern. The sample size for all of North America 
is 1,144 organizations and 184,701 employees.

### Security Culture in Canada
![Security culture in Canada](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 12: Security culture in Canada. The sample size varies 
from country to country. For more details, please refer to the 
method section.*
Canada had a large variation 
between the state scores, ranging 
from the best performing Quebec 
(76) and Saskatchewan (76) to the 
worst performing Yukon (64). A score 
of 64 is ranked as Mediocre on the 
Security Culture Index and signifies 
a large increase in human factor 
risks compared to the level above, 
Moderate. 
Sample sizes in many Canadian 
states are low, suggesting that most 
organizations do not have even a 
minimum level of security measures 
in place. It is our recommendation 
that organizations in these regions implement adequate security culture measures, including training 
and assessments. 
![Security culture in Canada as seen by organizational size](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 13: Security culture in Canada as seen by organizational size.*
In Canada, we see the overall security culture score of all three sizes of organizations (73) is consistent. 
Canada also shows very little variation in the dimension scores across the size of organizations. Overall, 
the best performing dimensions are Attitudes and Communication, in which Small organizations 
outperform the others. Looking closer, Small and Medium sized organizations appear to perform the 
same or better than Large organizations on every dimension except Compliance and Responsibility. 
However, performance of these two dimensions is relatively low for all organizations in Canada. 
Canada has a sample size of 76 organizations and 7,108 employees. 

### Security Culture in the United States of America
![Security culture in the United States of America](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 14: Security culture in the United States of America. The sample 
size varies from state to state. For more details, please refer to the 
method section.*
The USA is underperforming when it comes to security culture. When breaking the country into the 
states, a more detailed image emerges: the national score is hiding differences in the scores between the 
states. We observe that both 
East and West coast states 
are generally performing 
with better scores, with 
Vermont (77) and Rhode 
Island (77) on the East coast 
and Oregon (77) on the 
West coast performing more 
favorably than the rest. 
Inland states like South 
Dakota (72), Iowa (72) 
and Arkansas (72) are 
examples of states that 
perform poorly.
![Security Culture in the United States of America as seen by organizational size](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 15: Security Culture in the United States of America as seen by organizational size.*
In the USA, we see differences in security culture based on organizational size, where small 
organizations are outperforming larger organizations. Small organizations are much better at 
communicating than larger organizations, and have higher levels of Cognition and Responsibility. 
Large organizations rate the highest when it comes to Behavior. For organizations of all sizes, there 
are two notable valleys in Cognition and Responsibility. It is our recommendation that organizations 
assess their employees to identify weak spots in employees’ understanding around their role and 
responsibilities towards security, and implement targeted training and education programs to improve. 
The USA has a sample size of 1,068 organizations and 177,593 employees. 

### Security Culture in Oceania
![Security culture score in Oceania](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 16: Security culture score in Oceania. The sample size 
varies from country to country. For more details, please refer 
to the method section.*
Security culture in Oceania is showing 
that Australia (73) and New Zealand 
(72) are quite different from each 
other, and neither is doing particularly 
well. It is highly recommended that 
organizations in this region step 
up their investments in security 
awareness, behavior and culture 
going forward. The other parts of 
the region are lagging far behind, 
not even measuring on the Security 
Culture Index. 
![Security culture in Oceania as seen by organizational size](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 17: Security culture in Oceania as seen by organizational size.*
In the region of Oceania, we noticed that, unlike other regions, none of the lines cross or even meet. We 
also see that the lines are quite similar in shape, with the main difference being the quality of security 
culture. Again, we see that Large organizations perform worse on the Communication dimension, 
while Small organizations outperform the others on all dimensions. Also worth noting is that Large 
organizations in Oceania perform very poorly on Compliance and Responsibility compared to Europe 
and North America, suggesting that these two dimensions should be given more attention going 
forward. The sample size for all of Oceania is 46 organizations and 9,635 employees. 

### Security Culture in Central and South America
![Security culture score in Central and South America](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_url.png)
*Figure 18: Security culture score in Central and South 
America. The sample size varies from country to country. 
For more details, please refer to the method section.*
Central American countries show a wide 
variation of security culture scores, with 
Mexico performing better than most. 
Sample sizes in many Central American 
countries are low, suggesting that most 
organizations do not have a minimum level 
of security measures in place. It is our strong 
recommendation that organizations in these 
regions implement adequate security culture 
measures, including training and assessments. 
Most of South America reflected low security 
culture scores, with the notable exception of 
Colombia (77). We observe that the continent 
as a whole is starting to measure security culture, with more countries being added every year. 
Still, the low sample rate across the continent suggests that there is a long way to go, and organizations 
need to ramp up their security game.

*Figure 19: Security culture in Central and South America as seen by organizational size.*
Our sample size for Central and South America is 24 organizations and 2,913 employees. The 
most notable difference in Central and South America is how Large organizations have very large 
differences between Behaviors (85) and the other dimensions. Further, it is worrying to see how 
all organizations are struggling with the Cognition and Responsibility dimensions. These very low 
scores strongly suggest the need for more frequent training and assessments, and a focus on the 
need for every employee to take security seriously. 
Another interesting observation is how in Medium organizations, the dimension of Norms is spiking at 
79, much higher than any other region. This is likely due to the sample size, but we will be watching 
this closely in the future to learn more about why this is appearing. 

## Security Culture Industry Trends
New to our 2022 report is a comparative view of how security culture trends over periods of 
time, specifically from 2019-2021. The following snapshots will highlight movement and provide 
an understanding of how each industry fares on the Security Culture Index (SCI). Comprehensive 
details of each industry sector can be found on the corresponding Industry Benchmark pages for 
that industry sector.

### Global Trends as Seen Across the Dimensions of Security Culture
When looking at security culture only by its total score, it seems like nothing has changed in the 
past three years. With a global, average score of 73, security culture seems stagnant. Our ability 
to measure across the seven dimensions of security culture provides us with a unique perspective 
into exactly how security culture changes over time, and as can be observed in the figure below, 
we see that security culture has indeed changed quite a bit since 2019.
