Security is the result of decisions and actions made by many different people. Every individual 
has a part to play, but as digital transformation and DevSecOps adoption accelerates, security and 
development teams both take center stage. The struggles and wins of one team increasingly affect 
the other. Which is why for this year’s State of Pentesting report, we decided to focus on issues and 
stats that are relevant to both security and development teams: to separate these two inextricably 
linked groups would only yield a partial picture of the security landscape. 
Cobalt is a Pentest as a Service vendor, so we get to directly observe how organizations deal with 
vulnerabilities and the challenges threatening their security. One of their most pressing issues? 
They don’t have enough people on their teams to handle the workload. Headlines around “The Great 
Resignation” continue to populate news feeds, but those working in tech might argue they have 
always had to deal with a lack of manpower. We began to suspect things have moved to a critical 
tipping point when our 2021 pentesting data started showing results like this:
	
Æ Teams have been struggling with the same vulnerabilities for 5 years in a row.
	
Æ Most of the findings we discover are connected to missing configurations, outdated 
software, and lack of access management controls—all issues that can start piling when 
workloads are getting out of control. 
	
Æ Teams want to fix all of their vulnerabilities, but end up neglecting those that aren’t “Critical” 
or “High” risk.
	
Æ Most findings that get fixed take approximately 14 days to address, but there are situations 
where they take 31 days or longer.

## Executive Summary
Research Methodology
Cobalt’s State of Pentesting report data comes from two sets:
	
Æ 2,380 pentests conducted over the course of 2021.
	
Æ A survey of 602 cybersecurity and software development professionals.
For more information see Appendix B, “Methodology”.

We started to think, are teams reaching a breaking point, dealing with too much work? If so, could we 
capture or quantify the impact? Here are a few takeaways from our research that may make you pause:
	
Æ Nearly every team we surveyed has been affected by talent shortages.
	
Æ As a result, organizations are losing strength in their security posture and code quality, 
creating considerable risk of successful breaches.
	
Æ Try as they might to retain their talent, organizations are seeing a lot of resignations. More 
than half of survey respondents are considering quitting their jobs.
These stressful circumstances can wreak considerable damage, both to organizations and their 
people. Leadership should take a hard look at what is causing burnout and disillusionment, take stock 
of their go-to-market priorities versus their teams’ capacity, and consider the daily interactions they 
have with their colleagues. Our research highlights underlying concerns, but also proposes solutions. 
The first step? Acknowledge that business as usual is not usual. Not anymore, and perhaps may 
never go back to pre-pandemic expectations.

## The State of Pentesting 2022 at a Glance

Top Vulnerability Categories
Top Findings
1.	 Server Security Misconfigurations 
2.	 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
3.	 Broken Access Control
4.	 Sensitive Data Exposure
5.	 Authentication and Sessions
These vulnerability categories have stayed at 
the top of our list for 5 years straight.
To proactively fix and prevent vulnerabilities, both 
security and development teams need access to 
more resources, particularly manpower. 
Neither group has that luxury. Out of 602 
respondents, almost everyone said they struggle 
with talent shortages.

THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022 AT A GLANCE
Talent shortages have a tangible impact on security programs. As colleagues leave and roles 
stay open, teams are struggling to maintain security standards, particularly around compliance 
and supporting secure development. Vulnerabilities are more likely to slip past undetected, and 
teams are concerned they’re not ready to respond to an attack. Their biggest concerns are social 
engineering and third-party software exposure.

THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022 AT A GLANCE
Talent shortages are also straining collaboration efforts between security and development 
departments. This slows teams down, both in fixing critical vulnerabilities and meeting launch 
deadlines. In addition, the quality of developers’ work drops, raising the chance that new code will 
bring in even more vulnerabilities.
Teams are stressed and burnt out. A large portion of respondents are considering quitting their jobs. 
But it’s not all doom-and-gloom. For an overview of what employers can do to reverse this trend, 
check the section ‘Hiring, Onboarding, and Retention’.
Now that we’ve addressed the more abstract takeaways from the survey, let’s turn our sight towards 
the security vulnerabilities that slipped past teams’ defenses.

## What Are the Most Common Vulnerabilities?

The answer to this question comes in two parts. The first step is to look at Vulnerability Categories, 
such as Broken Access Control or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Nested within these categories are 
Findings, which are more granular descriptions of the specific flaw an attacker could exploit. 
Here’s an example: 
Vulnerability Category: An application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This 
happens when the application doesn’t validate and encode user-supplied input properly, so it gets 
treated as code, rather than as text. There are two possible findings under this category:
Finding #1: An instance of Reflected XSS.
An attacker creates a URL that contains a  vulnerable 
parameter. When they send that URL to another 
user, the user’s browser accepts the code string and 
performs whatever actions it describes—for example, 
generating an alert box that prompts users to share 
sensitive information. 
Finding #2: An instance of Stored XSS. When an attacker passes script code to the server in a user-
editable location, the application stores it on the server. When another user accesses the affected 
page, their browser interprets and renders the stored code as part of the page.
Following the same hierarchy, we started our analysis with the 5 most 
frequently discovered vulnerability categories in 2021: 
1.	 Server Security Misconfigurations: 38%
2.	 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): 13% 
3.	 Broken Access Control: 11% 
4.	 Sensitive Data Exposure: 10% 
5.	 Authentication and Sessions: 8%

These stats should be familiar to readers who follow the OWASP Top 10 list for Web Application 
Security Risks. Each of our top vulnerability categories had a spot in their 2021 list.
What’s interesting is how our top vulnerability categories have—or rather, haven’t—changed in the 
last 5 years.
What’s the same: Since 2017, Server Security Misconfigurations have stuck around at the top 
position and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) has stayed in second place for every year other than 2018. 
The two vulnerability categories are often related. If your application is missing a Content Security 
Policy (CSP) header—a type of security configuration—you are more vulnerable to an injection 
attack like XSS. The prevalence of these vulnerabilities boils down to the following problem: “There’s 
something you can turn on—but you didn’t.” We typically see this after teams forget to adjust default 
settings when deploying their applications to a cloud environment.

WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON VULNERABILITIES?
OWASP Top 10
OWASP’s most widely-known project is reporting the frequently observed vulnerabilities 
for web applications in their Top Ten list. Cobalt’s reporting has largely referred to their 
taxonomy, with a few exceptions: in 2021, OWASP filed Cross-Site Scripting under the larger 
“Injection” category and renamed “Sensitive Data Exposure” to “Cryptographic Failures.” 
“Authentication and Sessions” in our list maps to “Identification and Authentication 
Failures” in theirs.

What’s different: Where we saw a notable difference is the rise of the Broken Access Control 
category, and we’re not alone in our observations. OWASP noticed the same uptick. In the 2017 
version of their list, Broken Access Control was at 5th place, but it shot up to the top position in 
their 2021 update with this stat attached: “94% of applications were tested for some form of Broken 
Access Control.”
One possible reason for this is growth in operations. We like to think of it like this: If you had a 
house with one door, all you have to worry about is keeping that one door locked. But if you expand 
that house and add a garage door and 5 windows—or in our case, adopt more technology, expand 
systems, widen networks, and manage more users—you’re more likely to forget to lock everything. 
Creating or updating your user/access matrix can help.
Diving deeper into our data, we uncovered a similar pattern when it came to the top 5 findings: most 
flaws from 2020 stayed at the top, but a couple of new issues made their way onto the list.

TOP 5 VULNERABILITY CATEGORIES

### 01. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) took the top spot for most common findings in 2021. This is a 
very common vulnerability across the web, observed even in web apps as prominent as Apple’s 
iCloud. In theory, any feature that allows user input can be vulnerable, because it gives attackers an 
opportunity to inject and store malicious scripts into web applications.

### 02. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) were a prevalent finding both in 2020 and 2021. This type 
of flaw has the potential to give attackers access to personally identifiable information, which later 
enables identity theft, fraud, or blackmailing. In 2017, pentesters found an IDOR vulnerability that 
could leak users’ Airbnb messages.
Diving deeper into our data, we uncovered a similar pattern when it came to the top 5 findings: most 
flaws from 2020 stayed at the top, but a couple of new issues made their way onto the list.

WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON VULNERABILITIES?
01. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
02. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Breaking Down Stored XSS
Here’s an example of how it works: A web form has a field that accepts user text input, then 
stores that input somewhere on the server’s database. An attacker accesses that web form 
and enters a line of code, which the server accepts and stores in the database. 
The next time a user pulls up data that includes the attacker’s input, their browser attempts 
to run the malicious code.
How do you fix and prevent Stored XSS? 
Overall, you should treat all user-supplied input as untrusted (or potentially malicious) data. 
This means taking the following steps while designing the application:
1.	 Only accept untrusted data input in select locations.
2.	 Create a whitelist of allowed characters. 
3.	 Always sanitize input, encode output, or both, for any data that comes into or out of 
the application. 
4.	 Use a well-known and secure encoding API for input and output encoding, such as 
the OWASP ESAPI, or research and use an existing output encoder.
Note: We do not recommend trying to write input and output encoders, unless absolutely necessary.

### 03. Outdated Software Versions
The Outdated Software Versions finding was at third place for both 2020 and 2021. At first glance, 
outdated software doesn’t sound risky or important, but recent security news suggest otherwise. 

WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON VULNERABILITIES?
03. Outdated Software Versions
What to Do About IDOR
Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) can give access to resources via user-supplied 
input. Attackers could bypass authorization by modifying a value of a parameter that points 
directly to an object in your database. 
Here’s an example: Due to the way a website or application handles resources, one 
customer’s file has the ID “file123” in the URL, which corresponds to that file’s location in 
the database.
An attacker who can access “file124” changes the resource ID number in the URL to a 
different number, such as “file123” and can view the other customer’s file.
How do you fix and prevent IDOR? 
Use per-user or per-session indirect object references. For example, instead of using the 
resource’s database key, you could use a drop-down list of six resources authorized for 
the current user with the numbers “1” to “6” to indicate which value the user selected. The 
application then maps these per-user indirect references back to the actual database key on 
the server, and returns the requested information.
Check the user’s access when they try to view content. Each time the application uses 
a direct object reference from an untrusted source, the application should also make an 
access control check to ensure that the user is authorized to access the requested object.
Why Outdated Software Matters
Let’s look at a recent example of a vulnerability that sidetracked development and security 
operations everywhere: the Log4j flaw. In late 2021, any team using the Apache Log4j library 
for logging and configurations was vulnerable to a remote code execution attack. Hackers 
could run code on vulnerable devices and take full control of them.
Apache issued a patch to fix this vulnerability on December 6th. It later became clear this 
patch didn’t fully address the problem, so they released another patch on December 13th. 

TOP 5 FINDINGS
THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022    |

### 04. Insecure SSL or TLS protocols
Where we started to see year-over-year differences in our data was in the increased frequency of 
misconfigurations around encryption, particularly around the use of SSL protocols. 
SSL in itself is outdated and insecure, and should be replaced with TLS 1.2 or 1.3. This vulnerability 
is common with applications deployed to the cloud, because teams don’t always go into the 
provider’s settings and adjust security configurations. 
While this is another example of a low-severity flaw, the use of outdated transport protocols doesn’t 
come without its risks. Attackers with a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) position can break into older secure 
communication channels and attempt to decrypt the information. Some configurations also allow an 
attacker to downgrade communication from a stronger cipher suite to one that they can crack.

WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON VULNERABILITIES?
04. Insecure SSL or TLS protocols
Then another one on December 17th. And another one on December 28th. Teams who 
didn’t stay on top of patch releases and ran outdated versions of the software were still 
vulnerable to a flaw that has been described as a “a severe risk” by the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency.
How do you fix and prevent Outdated Software Versions? 
The core of the problem is version management, which can add a lot to teams’ workloads 
when it takes dozens of apps and programs to keep a website, product, or business running. 
Staying on top of updates for all of them can quickly spiral out of control, which is why our 
pentesters recommend using an automated Vulnerability Management System to scan for 
software updates and notify the IT team when there are fixes to deploy.
SSL vs TLS
SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer, which is a type of protocol responsible for encryption, 
protecting the transfer of sensitive information like credit card details, Social Security 
Numbers, or other types of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
Because SSL has serious cryptographic weaknesses, the next version of the protocol—TLS 
or Transport Layer Security—became available in 1999. There have been multiple security 
updates since then, but many servers still take connections using outdated versions of the 
protocol. What we recommend is that your servers accept TLS v 1.2 or higher.

### 05. Lack of Security Headers
Setting up security headers can be an effective and inexpensive way to strengthen the security of a 
web application. At the same time, implementing them can seem tedious, especially to a stretched 
development team. 
The impact of lacking security headers can vary depending on the context of the application. A 
missing HTTP Strict Transport Security header on an online banking application is concerning, 
because an attacker could successfully intercept users’ HTTP requests and redirect them to a clone 
page to steal their information. 
Teams should carefully consider which headers are most important to both their operations and 
users, and work towards adding them across their servers.

WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON VULNERABILITIES?
Insecure SSL or TLS protocols
How to fix and prevent Insecure SSL? 
1.	 Use only the most up-to-date TLS protocols. Configure your servers to accept only 
TLS version 1.2 or 1.3. 
2.	 Do not accept any Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) versions.
3.	 Configure the server to use only strong cipher suites, which include AES ciphers at 
128 bits or higher, TDES/TDEA triple-length keys, and RSA at 2048 bits or higher.
Note: For legacy clients that require insecure browsers (sorry, Internet Explorer), it may 
be necessary to enable TLS 1.0. However, if you need to be PCI DSS compliant (e.g. your 
company processes credit card information), this is strictly forbidden.
While you’re at it, now is also a good time to check your SSL certificates and make sure they 
have not expired.

05. Lack of Security Headers
TOP 5 FINDINGS
Why Bother with Security Headers?
Security Headers are a type of HTTP response header—code which instructs browsers how 
to display content and interact with a web page without any of that instruction rendering on 
the user’s screen.
THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022    |
13
WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON VULNERABILITIES?
Security headers regulate security features around that communication and can help mitigate 
different attacks, such as Clickjacking, XSS, and encryption-related downgrade attacks. 
They can also strengthen privacy by enabling users to use their browsers’ security features 
such as disabling access to their webcam or microphone. 
How to implement security headers:
Consider implementing the following recommended security headers, at minimum:
	
Æ HTTP Strict Transport Security
	
Æ X-Frame-Options
	
Æ X-Content-Type-Options
	
Æ Content-Security-Policy
	
Æ X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies
	
Æ Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy
For more information on these and other headers that your servers may need, see the 
OWASP Secure Headers Project.

## How Much Risk Are Teams Managing?
In 2021, the majority of vulnerabilities we found were lower risk, with 54% classed as “Low” severity 
and 11% classed as “Informational.” 24% were “Medium,” 10% were “High,” and less than 1%—0.88% 
to be exact—were “Critical.”
Compared to 2020, we reported fewer findings with a severity level of “Medium,” “High,” and 
“Critical”—what organizations might label “important”—while “Low” and “Informational” became more 
common in 2021. Do these drops signal that assets are becoming more secure? Not necessarily.

HOW MUCH RISK ARE TEAMS MANAGING?
What These Risk Levels Mean
Every pentesting company describes their findings’ risk level differently. Until 2021, Cobalt 
used a 3-level system based on Impact (how the flaw could affect technical and business 
operations) and Likelihood (how likely it is attackers will exploit the flaw). 
In 2021, we switched to 5 more granular and descriptive levels. These are still based on 
Impact and Likelihood, but capture more nuance to the highest and lowest ends of the risk 
scale. Here’s what they mean:
Informational: Notes vulnerabilities of minimal risk to your business.
Low: Specifies common vulnerabilities with minimal impact on their own, but 
possibly dangerous if chained. 
Medium: Vulnerabilities that are “Medium risk <> Medium impact,” “Low risk <> High 
impact,” or “High risk <> Low impact.”
High: Impacts the security of your application platform/hardware, including supporting 
systems. Includes high probability vulnerabilities with a high business impact.
Critical: Includes vulnerabilities such as administrative access, remote code 
execution, financial theft, and more.
THE STATE OF PENTESTING 2022    |
15
“Low” and “Informational” vulnerabilities often get ignored or postponed because they don’t trigger 
alarm bells. These flaws pile up and attackers can chain them into more impactful attacks. Here’s 
an example: 
Finding #1: Username enumeration with a lack of rate limiting. Attackers can send hundreds 
or thousands of login requests without being stopped. 
Finding #2: Weak password policy. Customers can set passwords like ‘12345.’
On their own, these findings might not look critical, but together they give attackers the opportunity 
to brute-force their way into the application. It takes only one user with a weak password. Once 
attackers have access, they can look for other ways to increase their privileges and do more damage.
As we help customers patch vulnerabilities, we can observe how teams react to these findings. The 
scenarios we see are:
	
Æ Teams fix the finding and request a retest to confirm if the fix is working correctly. Note that 
we offer retests on discovered findings for free, so there is no financial barrier to retesting.
	
Æ Teams mark the finding as “Accepted Risk” because its severity level doesn’t meet their 
remediation threshold. 
	
Æ Teams don’t report their decision back to us. The finding could have been fixed, but a retest 
hasn’t checked if their patch is working. Alternatively, it’s staying in their backlogs for an 
indefinite period of time.

HOW MUCH RISK ARE TEAMS MANAGING?

16
HOW MUCH RISK ARE TEAMS MANAGING?
Even if we don’t know the reason, the intent behind “Accepted Risk” findings is clear: there will 
not be immediate action to remove this vulnerability. Findings with no return information are more 
ambivalent. We don’t know the outcome on the customer’s side, but we do know that the patch 
hasn’t been retested—chances are, there could still be an issue that gives attackers access. When we 
look at our data, we see a clear trend. The less “critical” a finding is, the less likely it is that teams 
will fix and verify it. That might seem obvious, but the reasoning isn’t what you think. 
It’s wrong to assume the core of the problem is that teams don’t care. We looked into this in last 
year’s report and we found a much more nuanced situation: security teams are determined to 
prioritize low-risk flaws—nearly 80% said they wished their organization focused on them just 
as much as “High” or “Critical” flaws. The challenge is a lack of resources, where 25% of our 
respondents said it took at least 60 days to patch low-risk findings.

## How Much Time Does It Take to Fix Vulnerabilities?
The median number of days teams needed to fix vulnerabilities was 14. But things started to change 
as we dug into that number. Do findings with a certain risk level get fixed faster, or slower? Does 
company size—and by extension security and development team size—influence that number in any 
way? Based on industry benchmarks around company and team sizes (these don’t hold true for 
everyone, but they’re a good place to start), we broke down our remediation data one step further.
Our expectations were that the closer a finding’s risk level is to “Critical,” the faster it gets fixed. 
This is true in most cases, with the exception of “Enterprise” companies who need 21 days (median) 
for the task. A couple of factors could be causing this: they are the largest company type in our 
list and are therefore more likely to have more complicated environments and slower change-
management processes.

HOW MUCH TIME DOES IT TAKE TO FIX VULNERABILITIES?
What surprised us was that “Enterprise” companies on average took 7 days to fix “Informational” 
findings—we expected these to be left as the lowest priority, requiring 31 days or longer. It could be 
that they are more straightforward to fix and get remediated first as “low-hanging fruit,” while others 
are stuck somewhere in the pipeline.
This graph does confirm that smaller companies are faster in fixing their findings. The “Small” 
category seems to be the fastest with every risk level, but “Mid-Size”” aren’t too far behind. 
Why is this? We admit that a research best practice is to translate data into actionable insight, but 
we came up short when we tried to posit a conclusive answer. Our assumptions are that smaller 
companies might be more nimble, with smaller attack surfaces and fewer processes to follow. 
They can maintain velocity because they are often born in the cloud, practice agile processes, and 
smaller teams face greater scrutiny and individual accountability than their enterprise counterparts. 
Enterprises may follow a waterfall methodology, or be undergoing digital transformation to migrate 
legacy systems and processes. 
Regardless, we recognize that this is guesswork and aim to make it a point of further exploration in 
The State of Pentesting 2023.

## Talent Shortages Holding Back Security & Development
Our pentesting data helped us conclude that:
	
Æ Teams are struggling to fix and prevent the same vulnerabilities for at least the past 5 years in a row.
	
Æ The majority of findings stem from not staying on top of configurations, software updates, 
or access management controls. 
	
Æ Teams want to fix every vulnerability, but end up neglecting those classed as “low-risk.” 
	
Æ The findings that do get fixed typically take 14 days, but this number can fluctuate 
considerably based on the risk level, with some findings needing 31 days or longer. 
Teams want to have robust security, but struggle to meet that objective. Cobalt’s State of Pentesting 
reports explore why; last year we looked into tools, processes, and where workflows could be more 
efficient. But that’s only part of the story. 
Before anything else, successful security programs need the right people, and enough of them. 
Everyone within an organization can be a part of this process, but as companies move towards a
