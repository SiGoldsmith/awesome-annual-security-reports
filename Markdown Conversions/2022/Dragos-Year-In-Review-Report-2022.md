# 2022 Key Findings Overview
2022 saw a breakthrough escalation in capabilities 
by a new modular industrial control systems (ICS) 
malware, PIPEDREAM, developed by the threat group, 
CHERNOVITE. CHERNOVITE’S PIPEDREAM toolkit has 
the capabilities to impact devices that control critical 
infrastructure – devices that manage the electrical 
grid, oil and gas pipelines, water systems, and 
manufacturing plants. For industrial operators this 
can be viewed as a supply chain risk, as the methods 
target key vendor systems. 

PIPEDREAM is the first reusable cross-industry 
capability that impacts native functionality in 
industrial protocols and a wide variety of devices. 
Dragos and our third-party partners discovered and 
analyzed its capabilities before it was employed. 
Malware development is shifting towards improving 
on the known and successful techniques used in earlier 
ICS cyber attacks. This accumulated knowledge may 
have informed PIPEDREAM’s malware framework, 
which is more robust and modular and most likely will 
inform CHERNOVITE and other adversaries’ malware 
development in the future. 

The threats and ransomware attacks tracked by Dragos 
in 2022 show a continued increase. Highlights of these 
attacks by vertical industry include:
* The first attacks against the mining and metals 
industries in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) 
region.
* Continued targeting of renewable energy companies 
in the U.S. and the European Union (EU).
* Increased attacks on energy, food and beverage, 
pharmaceuticals, chemicals, water and wastewater
* Accelerated attacks in electrical, manufacturing, oil 
and natural gas, and liquefied natural gas
 
## Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine
On February 25, 2022, the day after Russia invaded 
Ukraine, the ransomware group Conti declared that 
if a cyber attack or warfare were directed against 
Russia, Conti would use “all possible resources to 
strike back at the critical infrastructure of an enemy.” [^1]
During 2022, Ukraine saw increased threat group 
activity targeting its energy and critical industrial 
infrastructure sectors. Russia’s 2022 invasion of 
Ukraine provided opportunities for Russia-aligned 
actors to use their cyber offensive capabilities 
preemptively and in parallel to its kinetic attacks. 

As Western countries placed sanctions on Russia 
and indicted key members of Russian cyber 
operations, the U.S. government’s Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) prepared for 
potential retaliation by issuing a call for “Shields 
Up,” which included actions to safeguard ICS and OT 
environments. 

According to an analysis of the threats against U.S. 
energy entities, adversaries are primarily focused on 
reconnaissance. Dragos has observed fewer cyber-
focused attacks on OT in U.S. energy sectors than 
predicted at the beginning of the war between Russia 
and Ukraine. Dragos has not observed any ICS Cyber 
Kill Chain Stage 2 follow-on attacks against U.S. 
energy entities. 

While Dragos observed less than the predicted activity, 
there was still at least one significant attack. The 
Dragos-designated threat group ELECTRUM deployed 
a new variant of CRASHOVERRIDE/INDUSTROYER 
at a Ukrainian power company; however, this 
new variant did not have the full capabilities of 
CRASHOVERRIDE.

## Impacts of Ransomware 
on Manufacturing
Ransomware attacks on industrial infrastructure 
organizations nearly doubled in 2022. With over 
70 percent of all ransomware attacks focused on 
manufacturing, ransomware actors continue to 
broadly target many manufacturing sectors and 
subsectors. As ransomware activity increases, it 
results in more risk for OT networks, particularly 
networks with poor segmentation.

## Trends in ICS/OT Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities saw an increase of 27 percent in 2022. 
This was a material increase, but a slowdown in the 
growth rate. Improvements in the rate of mistakes and 
risk ratings were a very positive signal. The standard 
information technology (IT) approach to vulnerability 
mitigation is a patch. To patch in the OT world often 
requires system and plant shut-downs. ICS/OT relies 
on alternative mitigation to both reduce risk and 
maintain production. The 77 percent of vulnerabilities 
that lack that mitigation makes maintaining 
operations very challenging. 

## Markers for a Strong ICS/OT 
Cyber Defense – 5 Critical 
Controls
On the defense side, Dragos recommends using the 
SANS “Five ICS Cybersecurity Critical Controls” for 
industrial cybersecurity as the frame to evaluate 
progress. The statistics shown are only “indicators” of 
the five critical controls, though derived from in-depth 
engagements with industrial clients.

Trends in ICS-Specific Incident Response, the 
first of SANS Five Critical Controls, were mixed, 
with improvements in detection, elevation, and 
plan activation; scores declined in the ability to 
communicate, document, and recover. Electric utilities 
showed the best preparedness, followed by oil and gas. 
Manufacturing represented the worst results among 
verticals. 

For Defensible Architecture, the second critical 
control, there were marked improvements to 
use of network segmentation in engagements. 
Environments with significant network segmentation 
issues were down 2700 basis points; but with 50 
percent of environments still having issues, there 
is plenty of room for improvement. Similarly, 
uncontrolled external connections into OT were found 
in 53 percent of engagements in 2022; still high, but 
much better than 2021’s 70 percent. 

ICS Network Visibility, the third critical control, 
continued to be a challenge. A full 80 percent of 
environments had little or no visibility into traffic 
and devices in ICS/OT environments. Though an 
improvement of 600 basis points from 2021, the 
large number indicates that a vast majority of 
environments will find it challenging to detect and 
investigate issues, much less maintain accurate asset 
inventory. 

Secure Remote Access is the fourth critical control, 
and showed negative trending, with users in 54 
percent of environments using same credentials 
for IT systems as OT systems. Remote access is the 
most common way for threat groups to penetrate OT 
systems; sharing the same credentials make it much 
easier for threats to cross from IT to OT systems. 

Finally, for Risk-Based Vulnerability Management, 
the reduction in outright mistakes is encouraging. 
Only fifteen percent of CVEs included errors in 
2022, down 4 percent from 2021. But with 77 
percent of vulnerabilities lacking mitigation steps, 
it demonstrates the challenge of employing a risk-
management approach that can both mitigate the 
risk of exploit AND reduce production downtime from 
patches. 

Of course, that is a summary of only some of the 
findings. Much more detail from Dragos’s intelligence 
research, platform measurements, and consulting 
engagements follow.

After analyzing year-over-year activity, Dragos 
assesses with low confidence that the increase in 
threat group activity and the focus on energy sectors 
(electric, renewables, and ONG) could be the result of 
geopolitical tensions between the Russian Federation 
and the European Union (EU) over energy resources 
and the ongoing war in Ukraine. Threat group activity 
is relatively steady, and some of the increase in 
activity is unrelated to geopolitical tensions. Some 
threats Dragos tracks such as CHERNOVITE may 
proliferate into disruptive and destructive capabilities 
in the future.

## Threat Activity Overview
Summary of Dragos-designated threat 
group intelligence for 2022: 
**KOSTOVITE, KAMACITE, 
XENOTIME** and **ELECTRUM** 
exhibit all aspects of the ICS Kill 
Chain Stage 1, and several of Stage 
2 (Develop, and Install/Modify).

**BENTONITE** and **WASSONITE** 
demonstrate only Stage 1 aspects 
of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain

There are two new threat groups: 
**CHERNOVITE** and **BENTONITE** 
**ERYTHRITE** demonstrates only Stage 2 
aspects of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain.

Twelve threat groups were dormant.  
Zero threat groups were retired in 2022.
For context, here are the Dragos-designated threat 
group statistics from the 2021 Year in review: 
Three new threat groups: **KOSTOVITE, ERYTHRITE** 
and **PETROVITE** 
Three active threat groups: **STIBNITE, WASSONITE** 
and **KAMACITE** 

There were eight 
active threat groups: 
**BENTONITE, 
CHERNOVITE, 
ELECTRUM, ERYTHRITE, 
KAMACITE, KOSTOVITE, 
WASSONITE** and 
**XENOTIME**. 
During 2022, Dragos tracked 20 threat groups and 
discovered two new threat groups — **CHERNOVITE** 
and **BENTONITE**.

**CHERNOVITE** is the threat group that 
developed PIPEDREAM. PIPEDREAM is 
the seventh and most recent ICS-targeted 
malware discovered in 2022.

**BENTONITE** targets the ONG and LNG 
industrial verticals in the U.S. 
**CHERNOVITE** represents the most 
dangerous threat group to date as it exhibits 
all aspects of the ICS Kill Chain Stage 1 and 
Stage 2.

## How Dragos Tracks Threat Activity 
To be prepared for future threats to industrial infrastructure, 
Dragos emphasizes the importance of understanding how 
adversaries steal information, and gain access to a company’s 
ICS/OT network and systems.

Dragos tracks threat groups that attempt to gain access to ICS/
OT networks and that could cause a potential threat to them in 
the future.

A number of the threats that Dragos tracks may evolve their 
disruptive and destructive capabilities in the future because 
adversaries often do extensive research and development (R&D) 
and build their programs and campaigns over time. This R&D 
informs their future campaigns and ultimately increases their 
disruptive capabilities. For instance, most of PIPEDREAM’s 
modules are examples of capabilities that were designed to 
target OT and ICS infrastructure. Even when an adversary 
accidentally stumbles onto an OT environment, there is still a 
risk to that environment. Adversarial intent is not necessarily 
positively correlated with attacks on ICS/OT environments 
– they may be “targets of opportunity” discovered during 
enterprise IT reconnaissance. 

For the 2022 Year in Review, Dragos 
has broadened its criteria for threat 
group reporting. Dragos now covers 
threat group activity from 2020 to 
2022.
 
This methodology is based on the 
following parameters: 
* If a threat group has been active 
during the last 24 months, it is 
considered active. 
* If there is no threat group activity 
during the last 24-48 months, it 
is considered dormant. 
* If there is no activity in 48 
months, the threat group is 
considered retired.
* Dragos maintains a list of 
dormant threat groups to analyze 
new activity, looking for any 
overlaps or similarities in the 
threat group tactics, techniques, 
and procedures (TTP) or target 
sets. 
This new approach allows Dragos to 
focus and provide intelligence on the 
cyber threats that occurred during 
the last two years. In cases where 
the evolution of an attack pattern is 
recognized, even when threat groups 
are retired, Dragos will report on 
this activity. Threat groups could go 
dormant for various reasons, such as 
the threat group stopping its activity 
or repurposing its operations. Or, 
potentially, we lost visibility of its 
actions.

# 2022 New Threat Groups
## CHERNOVITE
**CHERNOVITE** – Developer of PIPEDREAM 
**CHERNOVITE** is the developer of PIPEDREAM, a 
modular ICS attack framework and the seventh 
known ICS-specific malware, following STUXNET, 
HAVEX, BLACKENERGY2, CRASHOVERRIDE, TRISIS, 
and Industroyer2. CHERNOVITE’s PIPEDREAM is the 
first ever cross-industry disruptive/destructive ICS/
OT capability. It represents a substantial escalation in 
adversarial capabilities.

**CHERNOVITE** possesses a breadth of ICS-specific 
knowledge beyond what has been demonstrated by 
previously discovered threat groups. The ICS expertise 
demonstrated in the PIPEDREAM malware includes 
capabilities to disrupt, degrade, and potentially destroy 
physical processes in industrial environments. 

PIPEDREAM is the first scalable, cross-industry ICS 
attack framework known to date.
While PIPEDREAM itself is a new ICS capability, its 
emergence is also indicative of the trend toward more 
technically capable and adaptable adversaries targeting 
ICS/OT. In addition to implementing common ICS/
OT-specific protocols in PIPEDREAM, CHERNOVITE 
improved the techniques from prior ICS malware. 
CRASHOVERRIDE, and the associated threat group, 
ELECTRUM, exploited the OPC Data Access (OPC 
DA) protocol to manipulate breakers and electrical 
switchgear. CHERNOVITE, on the other hand, uses the 
newer but comparable OPC UA protocol. 

Dragos assesses with high confidence that a state 
actor developed PIPEDREAM intending to leverage 
it in future operations for disruptive or destructive 
purposes. Dragos assesses with moderate confidence 
that CHERNOVITE represents an “effects/impact team” 
instead of an “access team” — meaning, that PIPEDREAM 
was designed to be leveraged for impact after the initial 
access into the target environment has been obtained by 
another threat group. 

Most likely, CHERNOVITE developed PIPEDREAM’s 
capabilities for a malicious operator with the intent 
and motivation to access, manipulate, and disrupt OT 
environments and processes. PIPEDREAM’s capabilities 
can provide an adversary with a range of options for 
learning about a target’s OT network architecture and 
identifying its assets and processes. This information 
can set the stage for disruptive and destructive effects, 
but it also increases an adversary’s knowledge to develop 
even more capabilities to disrupt or destroy on a much 
broader scale.

In its present form, the PIPEDREAM attack framework 
could be leveraged to target equipment in multiple 
sectors and industries. Given PIPEDREAM’s modular 
nature, CHERNOVITE could easily adapt it to compromise 
and disrupt a broader set of targets.

Therefore, it is necessary for defenders to harden their 
environment against CHERNOVITE’s known set of 
capabilities and focus on the tactics, techniques, and 
procedures (TTP), abuse of environment-native protocols 
and functionality, and exploitation of a lack of OT asset 
visibility and network monitoring.

Dragos assesses with low confidence that no adversary 
has employed or leveraged components of PIPEDREAM 
against industrial networks for disruptive or destructive 
effects. Dragos’s discovery of CHERNOVITE constitutes 
a rare case of accessing and analyzing malicious 
capabilities developed by an adversary before its 
employment, giving defenders a unique opportunity to 
prepare in advance.

### CHERNOVITE
**ADVERSARY**
* Development and effects team 
focused on ICS disruption
**CAPABILITIES**
* Unique tool development
* Uses ICS-specific protocols for 
reconnaissance, manipulation, and 
disabling of PLCs
* PLC Credential Capture. Password 
brute forcing and denial of service
**VICTIMS**
* Could impact all industries, initially 
targeting electric, ONG, and 
manufacturing
* Companies with Schneider Electric, 
Omron, and CODESYS PLCs, as well 
as any OPC UA
**INFRASTRUCTURE**
* Unknown
**ICS IMPACT**
* Loss of View, Availability, Safety, 
and Control
* ICS Kill Chain Stage 2 – Install/
Modify, Execute ICS

<br>

## BENTONITE
**BENTONITE** 
**BENTONITE** is a new threat group increasingly and 
opportunistically targeting maritime oil and gas (ONG), 
governments, and the manufacturing sectors since 2021. 
**BENTONITE** conducts offensive operations for both espionage and 
disruptive purposes.

**BENTONITE** seeks to exploit vulnerable remote access assets or 
internet-exposed assets that can facilitate access. 
**BENTONITE**’s operations have impacted North American ONG 
maritime support organizations and State Local Tribal and 
Territorial (SLTT) governments. **BENTONITE** compromised these 
organizations by exploiting vulnerabilities on internet-facing 
assets through Log4J and VMWare Horizons vulnerabilities. 
Once **BENTONITE** achieves initial access, the adversary delivers 
a downloader-type malware implant to retrieve additional 
malware implants from adversary-created GitHub accounts. These 
malware implants conduct command and control to adversary-
owned infrastructure, reconnoiter the compromised host, conduct 
network reconnaissance, and establish a connection through SSH, 
enabling the adversary operator to perform interactive operations.

**BENTONITE**’s activities are highly opportunistic when it comes to 
the victims they target. Additionally, once **BENTONITE** gains access 
to a victim’s environment, this adversary is very tenacious in its 
persistence to retain its access by performing lateral movement 
to other hosts, collecting credentials, and establishing long-term 
persistence to re-enable access to the adversary operator through 
scheduled tasks in combination with malware implants. 

**BENTONITE** utilizes legitimate infrastructure, such as GitHub, 
and adversary-owned infrastructure for command and control 
and capability delivery. **BENTONITE** is capable of and has in past 
compromises  disrupted operations through wipers; however, 
this was not observed in the compromises of the ONG or SLTT 
organizations. 

**BENTONITE** has overlapping activity clusters with Microsoft’s 
activity group PHOSPHORUS (DEV-0270) and CrowdStrike’s 
activity group NEMESIS KITTEN.

### BENTONITE
**ADVERSARY**
* Associated with PHOSPHORUS
* Able to run multiple, concurrent 
operations
**CAPABILITIES**
* Multi-stage downloaders, victim 
enumeration, reconnaissance and C2 
capabilities
* Vulnerability exploitation
* Heavy use of Powershell to facilitate 
compromise
* Disruptive capabilities
**VICTIMS**
* Highly opportunistic
* U.S. oil and gas, manufacturing
* State, local, tribal and territorial 
organizations
**INFRASTRUCTURE**
* Credential harvesting
* Separate domains for phishing and 
C2
* Utilizes Github for delivery, SSH and 
HTTP for C2
**ICS IMPACT**
* Espionage, data exfiltrations, 
and IT compromise
* Disruptive effects possible

# Updates on Active Threat Groups
## KOSTOVITE, KAMACITE, XENOTIME, ELECTRUM, ERYTHRITE, WASSONITE
### KOSTOVITE
**KOSTOVITE**
In June 2021, Dragos began tracking the threat group 
**KOSTOVITE**. **KOSTOVITE**’s operational technology (OT)-related 
operations have focused on the compromise of an energy firm 
and the firm’s managed global power generation facilities.

**KOSTOVITE** has achieved Industrial Control System (ICS) 
Cyber Kill Chain Stage 1 and subsequent ICS Kill Chain Stage 2, 
Develop events.

While **KOSTOVITE**’s demonstrated capabilities do not 
extend to industrial control system (ICS)-disruption-specific 
tools or resources, **KOSTOVITE** has demonstrated skilled 
lateral movement and initial access operations into ICS/OT 
environments and on SCADA assets.

**KOSTOVITE** focuses on compromising and subverting internet- 
exposed remote access devices as a jump-off point into OT 
targets while establishing persistence across the upgrades of 
the remote access devices.

**KOSTOVITE** maliciously enlists third-party internet of things 
(IoT) devices to relay and obfuscate the origin of their activities. 
**KOSTOVITE** shows unusual discipline by dedicating a set of 
compromised IoT devices to a single target and then performing 
a clean-up operation at the end of its activities.

Based on non-public reporting on Manganese adversary 
activity and activity described by an early 2022 Kaspersky ICS 
CERT report[^2], multiple adversaries with different objectives 
may share a common infrastructure with **KOSTOVITE**.

While the infrastructure enumerated by Microsoft and 
Kaspersky shows a tentative link to the **KOSTOVITE** activity 
that Dragos observed in 2021, Dragos cannot definitively tie all 
these activities to one adversary.

Recent public reporting shows **KOSTOVITE** may be linked to 
the APT5 adversary group. The U.S. government reported in 
December 2022 that APT5 was actively exploiting a zero-day 
vulnerability in Citrix perimeter access devices, which parallels 
**KOSTOVITE**’s zero-day exploitation against an energy O&M 
firm in 2021, and previous APT5 campaigns targeting perimeter 
devices in 2019. Both **KOSTOVITE** and APT5 have leveraged 
vulnerabilities in perimeter-facing remote access appliances, 
achieving persistent access to targets over several months 
undetected. There is a likelihood that **KOSTOVITE**’s tooling may 

### KOSTOVITE
**ADVERSARY**
* High level of operational discipline 
and network device knowledge
* Lives off land with stolen sys/net-
admin creds
**CAPABILITIES**
* Zero-day exploits
* Undetected intrusion via internet 
remote access device compromise 
and subversion
**VICTIMS**
* Global energy company 
based in U.S.
* North America, Australia
**INFRASTRUCTURE**
* Dedicated per target
* Compromised home and small 
business IoT devices exposed to 
Internet
* Compromised enterprise perimeter 
devices
**ICS IMPACT**
* Stage 2 of ICS Kill Chain
* Intrusion into OT networks and 
devices

<br>

expand to include the remote access device zero-days 
exploited by APT5.

If **KOSTOVITE** once again takes aim at ICS and OT, 
asset owners and operators should be ready with 
robust detection, defense, and mitigation regimes for 
the ICS and OT enclaves that are inside the enterprise 
perimeter and potentially vulnerable to **KOSTOVITE** 
exploitation.

<br>

### KAMACITE
**KAMACITE** 
**KAMACITE** is a threat group targeting industrial infrastructure 
verticals since at least 2014. **KAMACITE** is linked to multiple 
industrial infrastructure intrusion events, including operations 
enabling the 2015 and 2016 Ukraine power events. **KAMACITE** 
possesses industrial control system (ICS)-specific capabilities 
but has also facilitated ICS disruptive events executed by other 
threat groups such as ELECTRUM.

Most recently, in June of 2022, Dragos identified **KAMACITE** 
network infrastructure communicating with an oblenergo (a 
regional power distribution entity) in Ukraine. The oblenergo 
**KAMACITE** targeted in this incident was one of the same 
oblenergos impacted in a 2015 cyber attack, which triggered a 
large-scale power outage across western Ukraine.

In February 2022, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in 
the UK released a joint report with CISA, NSA, and FBI detailing 
the new malware capability called CYCLOPS BLINK, stating that 
it targets “primarily small office/home office (SOHO) routers 
and network-attached storage (NAS) devices.”[^4] The CYCLOPS 
BLINK malware family targets routers and firewall devices from 
WatchGuard and ASUS and adds them to a botnet for command 
and control (C2).

Dragos assesses with high confidence that this activity is 
associated with **KAMACITE**. At the time of the February 2022 
report, Dragos identified victims in the electric, natural gas, and 
food and agriculture (including manufacturing, processing, 
and storage) industries communicating with **KAMACITE**’s C2 
infrastructure. 
 
In March of 2022, Dragos analyzed new CYCLOPS BLINK 
samples that appeared in the wild.[^6] Based on this analysis, 
Dragos discovered new C2 infrastructure associated with 
**KAMACITE**’s CYCLOPS BLINK operations. Dragos identified 
a set of hosting provider-owned IP addresses, which host 
domains for organizations in the rail, aerospace, food & 
beverage, and automotive sectors, along with three U.S. 
Government IP addresses communicating with this new 
CYCLOPS BLINK C2 infrastructure. 

Dragos assesses with moderate confidence that this was 
scanning activity to identify vulnerable target devices. 
In April of 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) released 
a public notice that stated that through March of 2022, the U.S. 
DOJ had been copying and removing malware from vulnerable
