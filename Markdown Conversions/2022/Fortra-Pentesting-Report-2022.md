We’ll show a comparison to the results of the 2021 survey and 
also uncover new insights, analyzing the general evolution and 
advancement of the penetration testing field.

Introduction

As the number of successful cyber\-attacks continues to increase 
at a frightening pace, many organizations are embracing holistic 
security strategies that incorporate ways to detect and minimize the 
impact of a breach, as well as methods to preempt such attacks by 
uncovering and closing security gaps. Penetration testing is a key 
component of this proactive approach by identifying and exploiting 
security weaknesses, safely demonstrating the potential impact. Such 
efforts lay out paths to remediation and help prioritize threats based 
on the specific level of risk they pose to the organization, allowing 
security professionals to act well before an attacker can.

Penetration testing encompasses a great variety of security 
assessments, tools, and services. Three years ago, Core Security, by 
HelpSystems launched its first penetration testing survey in order 
to get a better picture of how cybersecurity professionals are using 
penetration testing in the field, providing a detailed picture of pen 
testing strategies and the resources required to deploy a successful 
pen testing program.

After this inaugural survey established a strong baseline of data, we 
decided to build upon it by conducting it annually, tracking year over 
year changes, trends, challenges, and areas of improvement. In this 
third annual global survey, we continued to discover slight shifts in 
the role penetration testing plays in the cybersecurity landscape.

The results are explored in detail in this report, providing valuable 
data on the following key issues related to pen testing:

• Top security concerns like ransomware, phishing, and 
misconfigurations
• Testing frequency and remediation
• Compliance concerns

2022 Penetration Testing ReportReasons for Pen Testing

Organizations continue to pen test for multiple reasons, with 75% 
reporting they perform pen tests for compliance, 75% for measuring 
security posture, and 57% for vulnerability management program 
support (Figure 1\). The 5% increase in compliance from the 2021 
survey may reflect the increasing number of organizations that 
have to adhere to specific industry standards or regulations. Those 
needing to prove compliance to standards that don’t specifically 
mandate penetration testing may be taking advantage of the fact 
that pen testing is one of the most efficient ways to both fulfill and 
prove adherence.

While the decrease in use as a support for vulnerability management 
programs could be concerning, it may also reflect the current security 
climate of rapidly increasing risk. Many organizations have become 
so overwhelmed that they currently rely on having more of an ad 
hoc security approach. Others are perhaps beginning to incorporate 
more sophisticated cybersecurity practices in direct response to an 
attack. While a penetration test will always provide helpful insights, 
organizations can achieve more with a formalized program, in which 
tools can work in tandem to provide maximal coverage and impact.

must constantly be vigilant for, patching or executing workarounds 
as necessary. According to the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), 
over 19,000 vulnerabilities were discovered in 2020, and over 20,000 
were found in 2021\. Penetration testing can be an invaluable tool 
for both uncovering vulnerabilities and ensuring that such fixes are 
properly implemented.

Common Security Concerns

Respondents reported phishing (80%), ransomware (68%), and 
misconfigurations (57%) as top concerns, which aligns with what 
cyber attackers are commonly targeting and deploying (Figure 2\). 

The rising concern over phishing and poor passwords (55%) 
illustrates the inescapable threat that employees inadvertently pose 
to organizations, either by carelessly opening an email or choosing 
a password that is both easy to remember and simple to guess. 
According to PhishLabs, phishing attacks grew by 28% in 2021\. 
Regular social engineering penetration tests are one of the best ways 
to reduce the risk of successful phishing attacks, as they can both 
flag vulnerable employees and also help to keep such attacks top 
of mind, helping to ensure employees think twice before clicking 
anything.

The concern over ransomware is also well justified and connected to 
phishing. According to the 2021 Malware Report, the number one 
way previous ransomware breaches had entered organizations was 
through phishing emails (70%). The rapid increase in ransomware 
attacks is alarming, with a consistent growth rate of well over 
100% year over year. The cost of ransomware attacks has also 
become overwhelming. The average ransom demand in 2021 was a 
staggering $220,298–and this number only tells half the story. The 
average recovery cost for data recovery, ransomware removal, etc. is 
$1\.85m.

Lastly, concern over misconfigurations is also understandable, as 
IT infrastructures become ever more complex, with even small 
organizations having multi\-faceted environments with multiple tools 
and systems that consistently need updating and other maintenance 
that can be hard to keep up with. For example, security vulnerabilities

2022 Penetration Testing ReportGeneral Penetration Testing Challenges

The value of pen testing is acknowledged by cybersecurity professionals—94% of respondents noted that penetration testing is at least somewhat 
important to their security (Figure 4\). There was even a small increase of 3% from last year’s results. However, perhaps the strongest indicator of an 
increased backing of pen testing efforts is the reduction in respondents experiencing challenges. For example, hiring enough skilled personnel is down 12% 
(Figure 3\). While there is certainly still a cybersecurity skills shortage, this decrease may indicate that organizations have been given sufficient budgets to 
hire such highly desired professionals. This is supported by the 7% decrease in the challenge to get executive sponsorship and funding for such programs. 
Additionally, the 15% decrease for those having issues getting others to act on the findings indicates both that programs are better funded, and that 
cybersecurity threats have become a higher priority than ever before. While the struggle to find third\-party penetration testers remains steady at 45%, this 
most likely means that third\-parties are consistently booked.

It is worth acknowledging that the confidence level may still be a bit too high, with a 9% jump from last year (Figure 5\). While additional investment is 
certainly something to be proud of, the security climate is so precarious that even the smallest amount of overconfidence can lead to disaster. Though it’s 
important not to become pessimistic about cybersecurity, it is equally critical not to rest on our laurels, continuing to shift and evolve alongside of, and 
hopefully ahead of, attackers.

2022 Penetration Testing ReportCompliance and Pen Testing

As seen in Figure 1, compliance to external mandates was one of the primary reasons respondents conducted penetration tests. In fact, 96% of respondents 
reported pen testing was at least somewhat important for their compliance initiatives (Figure 6\).

Typically, regulations like HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, GDPR, or the CMMC mandate appropriate protection of highly sensitive data, like credit card numbers, social 
security numbers, and other personally identifying information. Pen testing can provide insight on potential security weaknesses, showing how an attacker 
could gain access to these different types of data. Organizations can use such test findings to prioritize anything endangering sensitive data, even running 
retests to confirm appropriate remediation.

In order to ensure organizations are obeying these requirements, such regulations require proof of compliance. Pen tests are not only a way to evaluate 
an organization’s security posture, but they can also help verify adherence, proving to auditors or other authorities that mandated security measures are 
in place or working properly. Pen testing is even mandated to comply with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) in requirement 11\.3, 
which states that a comprehensive pen testing program must be implemented. As some of these other regulations are revisited and revised, it wouldn’t be 
surprising to see penetration testing become an explicit component in the future.

2022 Penetration Testing ReportPhishing

Phishing remains a pervasive threat, with 80% of respondents listing 
it as a top security concern. Though the technique of phishing is 
decades old, attackers continue to refine their methods. For example, 
according to PhishLabs, vishing threats grew by 554% in 2021\. 
Such attacks involve emails that are concerningly realistic, so much 
so that they convince victims to call a phone number. From there, 
attackers continue the ruse and solicit sensitive information to a fake 
representative. A well\-crafted phish can be easy for anyone to fall for, 
especially if they aren’t looking for the signs. 

Given the risk that such attacks pose, it was encouraging to see a 
4% increase in ongoing testing this year (Figure 7\). However, a slight 
increase in those that responded that they never conduct phishing 
simulations was discouraging. It’s hard to think that it’s a matter of 
a lack of awareness considering its continued coverage in the news. 
Considering only 30% of respondents use third\-party testing services 
for social engineering tests, it may be due to a lack of resources 
(Figure 19\).

Given the numerous other priorities, it’s understandable that 
phishing assessments would be outside the scope of engagements. 
However, organizations may want to consider a phishing campaign 
tool to run their own tests, which can be straightforward and run 
routinely. In fact, 48% of respondents felt that phishing capabilities 
were a crucial feature in pen testing tools (Figure 22\). These tests not 
only reveal who is susceptible to such attacks in your organization, 
they can serve as a reminder to employees to be mindful of what’s 
in their inbox. The results of these tests also provide a starting point 
when crafting employee education efforts.

2022 Penetration Testing Reporton external threat intelligence. Penetration testing focuses on the 
exploitation of these weaknesses to see if and how easily an attacker 
may be able to breach an environment. Since both tools are essential, 
it’s important that organizations can distinguish between the two, 
ensuring they have both layers of proactive security.

Penetration Testing Frequency

This year’s results are quite similar to 2021\. There is only a slight drop 
in the number of people who never pen test and a minor rise in 
those who pen test annually (Figure 8\). Though small, it may indicate 
some progress towards incorporating a proactive security strategy 
in addition to other more reactive efforts like antivirus and breach 
detection. At the very least, it suggests the stability of penetration 
testing once it’s introduced into an organization’s strategy.

With the majority of respondents still only testing one or two times a 
year, retesting needs to be given more priority. An initial test helps to 
determine a prioritized list of security weaknesses so organizations 
know what remediations are most urgent. But how can you be sure 
that problems have been properly fixed? Retesting against the 
baseline of an initial test confirms whether improvements have been 
successfully implemented and security holes are closed.

Additionally, an annual test may be scoped to focus on only the 
most critical systems. However, as infrastructures grow, even the 
most critical systems may be too broad of a scope. It could help 
to incorporate automated penetration testing tools, which can 
streamline the process and enable those with less experience to run 
more frequent, routine tests.

17% of respondents reported pen testing daily or weekly, which 
is likely a result of confusion around the difference between 
vulnerability scans and a full pen test (Figure 8\). Vulnerability 
scanners have a broad focus and can be run more frequently, 
detecting known security weaknesses and prioritizing them based

a 26% increase in team members with 6 or more years of experience 
(Figure 11\). This could also be reflective of the seeming increase in 
budgets, as organizations may be able to hire advanced penetration 
testers.

There is a significant decrease in the number of respondents who 
have an internal pen testing team at their organization (41%), with a 
15% decrease from last year’s survey (Figure 9\). Interestingly, there is 
also a 10% increase in the number of respondents who have had an 
in\-house team in the past. This may be explained by the 11% increase 
in people not having an internal team because they felt they didn’t 
need one full time (Figure 12\).

However, this does not appear to mean that penetration testing 
has decreased as a priority, as there is a 7% increase in those who 
use third\-party testing exclusively (Figure 12\). Additionally, there is 
a dramatic 24% decrease in those that list funding as a reason they 
do not have an in\-house penetration testing team, so there does not 
appear to be an issue with resources, either. As the economy recovers 
from the pandemic, organizations may simply be finding a balance in 
what security processes work best.

This decrease in the number of in\-house teams may also indicate that 
security teams are instead being given the additional task of running 
basic penetration tests, which are now easier to do with penetration 
testing tools. In fact, 54% of respondents who did not have internal 
teams noted that pen testing technology influenced their decision 
on whether to have an in\-house pen testing team (Figure 13\).

It is worth noting that organizations that did have teams do seem to 
have grown both in size and experience. There was a 10% increase 
in those that have 6\-10 team members, and a 5% increase in those 
that have more than 11 members (Figure 10\). Additionally, there was

2022 Penetration Testing ReportRemote Work 

The COVID\-19 pandemic has made a lasting impact on the workforce, 
with many companies declaring their employees will now be 
permanently remote or hybrid. Security teams will have to continue 
to adapt to the challenges that such an infrastructure poses, shifting 
priorities as needed.

The top three changes are the same as last year, with network (38%) 
and web application tests (35%) being given more emphasis and 
the scope of pen tests being broadened (35%). The numbers are 
generally down from last year, which may reflect those strategies 
had already been revised sufficiently in 2020 (Figure 14\). The 8% 
increase for those that have had no impact on their pen testing 
priorities is somewhat surprising given how much remote work 
increases the attack surface. For example, security teams can’t verify 
how employees are managing their home networks, potentially 
adding multiple new attack vectors. Running more network security 
tests will help to identify new vulnerabilities that result from a newly 
remote workforce.

2022 Penetration Testing ReportThough many assume an in\-house team is meant as a replacement 
for third\-party services, organizations should ideally use both. IT 
environments are constantly changing, and small mistakes could 
easily open up new attack vectors. While third\-party services bring an 
objective outlook and diverse skillsets, internal pen testing team can 
provide regular, standardized testing. With 63% of respondent using 
both types of services in some capacity, it appears that a balance 
between internal and external pen testing is regularly being followed 
(Figure 18\).

Third\-Party Services

Third\-party pen testing teams remain a popular resource, with 83% 
of respondents leveraging third party teams in some capacity (Figure 
18\). For organizations that don’t have any tests conducted in\-house, 
third\-party pen testing teams may be the only way an organization 
can find out the state of their security. While not as large of an issue 
as it was in last year’s survey, 32% of respondents listed a lack of 
personnel to conduct such tests, emphasizing the importance of 
having pen testing services available (Figure 15\).

Even when organizations have security teams that can conduct 
penetration tests, they may not be dedicating 100% of their time 
to it. Third\-party teams are fully immersed specialists that can stay 
up to date on the latest trends. They can be an invaluable way to 
bring different skillsets to the organization, not to mention a fresh 
perspective. This external viewpoint (63%) and fresh skillset (56%) 
were top reasons respondents listed for why organizations use third\-
party teams (Figure 15\).

Wanting an impartial assessment from someone who is unfamiliar 
with their particular environment may also be a reason for why 79% 
of organizations tend to change services at least every 2\-3 years 
(Figure 17\). Alternatively, while it is not mandated by any specific 
compliance requirement, rotating between at least two firms is 
typically considered an industry best practice. Given how many 
respondents cited compliance (58%) as a reason for using thirdparty 
teams, this may also be part of why changing providers is so 
common (Figure 15\).

2022 Penetration Testing ReportPenetration Testing Tools

Respondents universally use at least one pen testing tool of some 
kind, illustrating how integral they are to the penetration testing 
process (Figure 20\). Penetration testing tools are a broad category 
and can include specialized tools like port scanners, password 
crackers, or SQL injection tools, as well as more comprehensive 
tools that offer multiple features to centralize the testing process. 
Consequently, most penetration testers use a variety of tools during 
engagements, either commercial, open\-source, or a combination 
of the two. There was a 12% increase from last year for those using 
both commercial and open\-source tools, potentially illustrating how 
some toolsets have been expanded (Figure 20\). Interestingly, there 
was a 13% decrease in those solely using free/open\-source tools, so 
perhaps organizations have gotten the budget to add one or more

commercial tools to their library.

Available features and functionality are top of mind when in the 
market for a paid pen testing tool, with 94% of respondents listing 
it as an important evaluation criterion (Figure 21\). In terms of the 
features that they’re looking for, reporting remained the most 
sought after capability in paid penetration testing tools, with 77% 
of respondents listing it as an important feature (Figure 22\). This 
corresponds with the high number of people who use pen testing 
for compliance— automated reporting functionality maintains 
consistency and produces reports that can be used for regulatory 
auditors.

At 67%, having an extensive threat library is the second most 
sought after feature (Figure 22\). Since exploit writing takes time 
and expertise, finding reliable, expertly tested exploit libraries that 
are regularly updated can make testing efforts significantly more 
efficient.

2022 Penetration Testing ReportOther Security 
Assessment Solutions

As mentioned earlier, penetration testing is an important 
component in a proactive security strategy. Other tools that security 
professionals are using are indicative of where organizations are in 
their vulnerability management journey (Figure 23\). Vulnerability 
scanners (87%), for example, are usually the first step, staying a bit 
higher level and having a broad scope, often covering large portions 
or the entirety of a security environment. Post\-exploitation and 
threat emulation, on the other hand, are commonly used in Red 
Teaming efforts, which are typically only used by those who have a 
fairly well\-established program in place.

Though integration wasn’t the most sought\-after feature in pen 
testing tools (42%), it experienced a small growth from last year, 
and may continue to do so as organizations expand their security 
portfolio and want to centralize as many tools as possible (Figure 
22\). Comprehensive penetration testing tools can be the ideal point 
of unification, as many can already integrate or incorporate with 
other common security assessment tools respondents are using, like 
vulnerability scanners (87%) (Figure 23\).

2022 Penetration Testing ReportPen Testing in Different Environments

As the most common operating system, it’s not surprising that Windows (87%) was the most common area respondents were most concerned about testing 
(Figure 24\). However, it’s clear that there is some level of concern about every type of environment. It was promising to see Linux have such a high level of 
concern (61%), considering how many used to believe Linux was innately secure and relatively immune to malware.

However, it is somewhat troubling to see both IoT (20%) and SCADA (8%) on the low end of the spectrum. Looking at respondents solely from the 
manufacturing industry, where SCADA is most common, only 20% of respondents are concerned about pen testing this environment. Many SCADA and IoT 
devices don’t have the more defensive measures in place. For example, there is no real antivirus for an MRI machine. Additionally, certain IoT devices and 
SCADA systems are essential to the primary function of an organization, so taking control of these devices or simply disabling them can completely cripple a 
business. Previous large scale attacks have even affected the functionality of cities or countries.

Similarly, while it was promising to see both external (86%) and internal (72%) infrastructures have high pen testing numbers, cloud infrastructures (46%) 
were significantly less commonly tested (Figure 25\). Cloud environment usage is still growing at a steady pace, and the myth persists on who is responsible 
for their security. The cloud provider is not solely in charge of ensuring that a cloud environment is protected. Depending on which environment an 
organization uses (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS), responsibilities will vary, but it is always a shared endeavor. Ideally, cloud environments should be pen tested just as 
often as internal and external environments.

2022 Penetration Testing ReportConclusion

The goal of this survey was to provide continued visibility into how cybersecurity professionals are utilizing pen testing. The results revealed the broad 
range of ways organizations pen test and gives every sign that penetration testing will remain a crucial practice for years to come. The flexibility in its 
implementation is key to ensuring these tests are routinely conducted—organizations have the option to use in\-house teams or third\-party services and 
open\-source or commercial tools. This is a positive indication that any organization can tailor a program to suit their needs and available resources.

While funding obstacles from last year appear to have been reduced, the continued challenges of phishing, ransomware, and inattention to specific 
environments prove more concerning long term, particularly given the prevalence of overconfidence in existing cybersecurity strategies. Putting your 
organization to the test on a regular basis is still the best way to ensure you’re continuously reducing your cyber risk exposure. The goal of pen testing 
shouldn’t simply be to check it off the to\-do list.

Penetration testing not only provides short term value by finding and prioritizing the security weaknesses that currently pose the highest risk, it can also 
provide long term value as part of a comprehensive security portfolio that is designed to adapt to both the new and persisting challenges of cybersecurity. 
By continuing to focus on building a comprehensive strategy, with proactive processes like penetration testing being prioritized as much as the traditionally 
defensive measures, organizations will deserve to feel confident in their security posture.
