Introduction by Tom Burt 
Corporate Vice President, Customer Security & Trust 
“The trillions of signals we analyze 
from our worldwide ecosystem 
of products and services reveal the 
ferocity, scope, and scale of digital 
threats across the globe” 
 
A snapshot of our landscape… 
Scope and scale of 
threat landscape 
The volume of password 
attacks has risen to an 
estimated 921 attacks 
every second – a 74% 
increase in just one year.
Dismantling 
cybercrime 
To date, Microsoft 
removed more than 
10,000 domains used 
by cybercriminals and 
600 used by nation 
state actors.
Addressing 
vulnerabilities 
93% of our ransomware 
incident response 
engagements revealed 
insufficient controls 
on privilege access and 
lateral movement.
On February 23, 2022, the cybersecurity world 
entered a new age, the age of the hybrid war.  
On that day, hours before missiles were launched 
and tanks rolled across borders, Russian actors 
launched a massive destructive cyberattack 
against Ukrainian government, technology, and 
financial sector targets. You can read more about 
these attacks and the lessons to be learned 
from them in the Nation State Threats chapter 
of this third annual edition of the Microsoft 
Digital Defense Report (MDDR). Key among 
those lessons is that the cloud provides the best 
physical and logical security against cyberattacks 
and enables advances in threat intelligence and 
end point protection that have proven their value 
in Ukraine. 
While any survey of the year’s developments in 
cybersecurity must begin there, this year’s report 
provides a deep dive into much more. In the 
report’s first chapter, we focus on activities of 
cybercriminals, followed by nation state threats in 
chapter two. Both groups have greatly increased 
the sophistication of their attacks which has 
dramatically increased the impact of their actions. 
While Russia drove headlines, Iranian actors 
escalated their attacks following a transition 
of presidential power, launching destructive 
attacks targeting Israel, and ransomware and 
hack-and-leak operations targeting critical 
infrastructure in the United States. China also 
increased its espionage efforts in Southeast 
Asia and elsewhere in the global south, seeking 
to counter US influence and steal critical data 
and information. 
Foreign actors are also using highly effective 
techniques to enable propaganda influence 
operations in regions around the globe, as 
covered in the third chapter. For example, 
Russia has worked hard to convince its citizens, 
and the citizens of many other countries, that 
its invasion of Ukraine was justified – while 
also sowing propaganda discrediting COVID 
vaccines in the West and simultaneously 
promoting their effectiveness at home. 
In addition, actors are increasingly targeting 
Internet of Things (IoT) devices or Operational 
Technology (OT) control devices as entry points 
to networks and critical infrastructure which 
is discussed in chapter four. Finally, in the last 
chapter, we provide the insights and lessons 
we have learned from over the past year 
defending against attacks directed at Microsoft 
and our customers as we review the year’s 
developments in cyber resilience. 
Each chapter provides the key lessons learned 
and insights based on Microsoft’s unique 
vantage point. The trillions of signals we analyze 
from our worldwide ecosystem of products and 
services reveal the ferocity, scope, and scale 
of digital threats across the globe. Microsoft is 
taking action to defend our customers and 
the digital ecosystem against these threats, 
and you can read about our technology that 
identifies and blocks billions of phishing 
attempts, identity thefts, and other threats to 
our customers.

Introduction
We also use legal and technical means to 
seize and shut down infrastructure used by 
cybercriminals and nation state actors and notify 
customers when they are being threatened 
or attacked by a nation state actor. We work 
to develop increasingly effective features 
and services that use AI/ML technology to 
identify and block cyber threats and security 
professionals defend against and identify 
cyber-intrusions more rapidly and effectively. 
Perhaps most importantly, throughout the MDDR 
we offer our best advice on the steps individuals, 
organizations, and enterprises can take to 
defend against these increasing digital threats. 
Adopting good cyber hygiene practices is the 
best defense and can significantly reduce the 
risk of cyberattacks. 
The state of cybercrime 
Cybercriminals continue to act as sophisticated 
profit enterprises. Attackers are adapting and 
finding new ways to implement their techniques, 
increasing the complexity of how and where 
they host campaign operation infrastructure. 
At the same time, cybercriminals are becoming 
more frugal. To lower their overhead and boost 
the appearance of legitimacy, attackers are 
compromising business networks and devices to 
host phishing campaigns, malware, or even use 
their computing power to mine cryptocurrency.

“The advent of 
cyberweapon 
deployment in 
the hybrid war 
in Ukraine is the 
dawn of a new  
age of conflict.” 
Nation state threats 
Nation state actors are launching increasingly 
sophisticated cyberattacks designed to evade 
detection and further their strategic priorities. 
The advent of cyberweapon deployment in 
the hybrid war in Ukraine is the dawn of a new 
age of conflict. Russia has also supported its 
war with information influence operations, 
using propaganda to impact opinions in Russia, 
Ukraine, and globally. Outside Ukraine, nation 
state actors have increased activity and have 
begun using advancements in automation, cloud 
infrastructure, and remote access technologies to 
attack a wider set of targets. Corporate IT supply 
chains that enable access to ultimate targets 
were frequently attacked. Cybersecurity hygiene 
became even more critical as actors rapidly 
exploited unpatched vulnerabilities, used 
both sophisticated and brute force techniques 
to steal credentials, and obfuscated their 
operations by using opensource or legitimate 
software. In addition, Iran joins Russia in the 
use of destructive cyberweapons, including 
ransomware, as a staple of their attacks. 
These developments require urgent adoption of 
a consistent, global framework that prioritizes 
human rights and protects people from reckless 
state behavior online. All nations must work 
together to implement norms and rules for 
responsible state conduct.

Devices and infrastructure 
The pandemic, coupled with rapid adoption 
of internet-facing devices of all kinds as a 
component of accelerating digital transformation, 
has greatly increased the attack surface of our 
digital world. As a result, cybercriminals and 
nation states are quickly taking advantage. 
While the security of IT hardware and software 
has strengthened in recent years, the security of 
IoT and OT devices security has not kept pace. 
Threat actors are exploiting these devices to 
establish access on networks and enable lateral 
movement, to establish a foothold in a supply 
chain, or to disrupt the target organization’s 
OT operations.

Introduction
Cyber influence operations
Nation states are increasingly using sophisticated 
influence operations to distribute propaganda 
and impact public opinion both domestically and 
internationally. These campaigns erode trust, 
increase polarization, and threaten democratic 
processes. Skilled Advanced Persistent 
Manipulator actors are using traditional media 
together with internet and social media to vastly 
increase the scope, scale, and efficiency of their 
campaigns, and the outsized impact they are 
having in the global information ecosystem. 
In the past year, we have seen these operations 
used as part of Russia’s hybrid war in Ukraine, 
but have also seen Russia and other nations, 
including China and Iran, increasingly deploy 
propaganda operations powered by social media 
to extend their global influence on a range 
of issues.

Cyber resilience
Security is a key enabler of technological success. 
Innovation and enhanced productivity can only 
be achieved by introducing security measures 
that make organizations as resilient as possible 
against modern attacks. The pandemic has 
challenged us at Microsoft to pivot our security 
practices and technologies to protect our 
employees wherever they work. This past year, 
threat actors continued to take advantage of 
vulnerabilities exposed during the pandemic 
and the shift to a hybrid work environment. 
Since then, our principal challenge has been 
managing the prevalence and complexity of 
various attack methods and increased nation 
state activity. In this chapter, we detail the 
challenges we have faced, and the defenses 
we have mobilized in response with our more 
than 15,000 partners.

Introduction
We believe Microsoft—independently and 
through close partnerships with others in 
private industry, government, and civil society
—has a responsibility to protect the digital 
systems that underpin the social fabric of our 
society and promote safe, secure computing 
environments for every person, wherever they 
are located. This responsibility is the reason we 
have published the MDDR each year since 2020. 
The report is the culmination of Microsoft’s 
vast data and comprehensive research. It shares 
our unique insights on how the digital threat 
landscape is evolving and the crucial actions that 
can be taken today to improve the security of 
the ecosystem. 
We hope to instill a sense of urgency, so readers 
take immediate action based on the data and 
insights we present both here and in our many 
cybersecurity publications throughout the year. 
As we consider the gravity of the threat to the 
digital landscape—and its translation into the 
physical world—it is important to remember that 
we are all empowered to take action to protect 
ourselves, our organizations, and enterprises 
against digital threats.
Thank you for taking 
the time to review  
this year’s Microsoft 
Digital Defense 
Report. We hope  
you will find that  
it provides valuable 
insight and 
recommendations 
to help us collectively  
defend the digital 
ecosystem. 
Tom Burt  
Corporate Vice President, 
Customer Security & Trust 
Our objective with this report is twofold:
 
1
To illuminate the evolving digital threat landscape for our customers, 
partners, and stakeholders spanning the broader ecosystem, shining 
a light on both new cyberattacks and evolving trends in historically 
persistent threats.
2
To empower our customers and partners to improve their 
cyber resiliency and respond to these threats.

The RaaS operator develops and maintains the tools to 
power the ransomware operations, including the builders 
that produce the ransomware payloads and payment portals 
for communicating with victims. 
A RaaS program (or syndicate) is an arrangement between 
an operator and an affiliate. The RaaS operator develops and 
maintains the tools to power the ransomware operations, 
including the builders that produce the ransomware 
payloads and payment portals for communicating with 
victims. Many RaaS programs incorporate a suite of 
extortion support offerings, including leak site hosting and 
integration into ransom notes, as well as decryption 
negotiation, payment pressure, and cryptocurrency 
transaction services. 
Affiliates are generally small groups of people “affiliated” 
with one or more RaaS programs. Their role is to deploy the 
RaaS program payloads. Affiliates move laterally in the 
network 
, persist on systems, and exfiltrate data. Each affiliate 
has unique characteristics, such as different ways of doing 
data exfiltration.
Access brokers sell network access to other cybercriminals, 
or gain access themselves via malware campaigns, brute 
force, or vulnerability exploitation. Access broker entities 
can range from large to small. Top tier access brokers 
specialize in high-value network access, while lower tier 
brokers on the dark web might have just 1–2 usable stolen 
credentials for sale.
Organizations and individuals with weak cybersecurity 
hygiene practices are at greater risk of having their network 
credentials stolen.

Introduction 
Cybercrime continues 
to rise, with increases 
in both random and 
targeted attacks. 
As cyber defenses improve and more 
governments and businesses take a proactive 
approach to prevention, we see attackers using 
two strategies to gain access required to facilitate 
cybercrime. One approach is a campaign with 
broad targets that relies on volume. The other 
uses surveillance and more selective targeting  
to increase the rate of return. Even when revenue 
generation is not the objective—such as nation 
state activity for geopolitical purposes—both 
random and targeted attacks are used. This past 
year, cybercriminals continued to rely on social 
engineering and exploitation of topical issues  
to maximize the success of campaigns. 
For example, while COVID-themed phishing  
lures were used less frequently, we observed 
lures soliciting donations to support the 
citizens of Ukraine increasing. 
Attackers are adapting and finding new ways 
to implement their techniques, increasing 
the complexity of how and where they host 
campaign operation infrastructure. We have 
observed cybercriminals becoming more 
frugal and attackers are no longer paying for 
technology. To lower their overhead and boost 
the appearance of legitimacy, some attackers 
increasingly seek to compromise businesses to 
host phishing campaigns, malware, or even use 
their computing power to mine cryptocurrency. 
In this chapter, we also examine the rise in 
hacktivism, a disruption caused by private 
citizens conducting cyberattacks to further 
social or political goals. Thousands of individuals 
around the world, both experts and novices, have 
mobilized since February 2022 to launch attacks 
such as disabling websites and leaking stolen 
data as part of the Russia-Ukraine war. It is too 
soon to predict whether this trend will continue 
after the end of active hostilities. 
Organizations must regularly review and 
strengthen access controls and implement 
security strategies to defend against 
cyberattacks. However, that is not all they 
can do. We explain how our Digital Crimes  
Unit (DCU) has used civil cases to seize malicious 
infrastructure used by cybercriminals and nation 
state actors. We must fight this threat together 
through both public and private partnerships. 
We hope that by sharing what we have learned 
over the past 10 years, we will help others 
understand and consider the proactive measures 
they can take to protect themselves and the 
wider ecosystem against the continually 
growing threat of cybercrime.

danger to all individuals as critical 
infrastructure, businesses of all sizes, 
and state and local governments are 
targeted by criminals leveraging a 
growing cybercriminal ecosystem.
Over the past two years, high profile ransomware 
incidents—such as those involving critical 
infrastructure, healthcare, and IT service 
providers—have drawn considerable public 
attention. As ransomware attacks have become 
more audacious in scope, their effects have 
become more wide ranging. The following are 
examples of attacks we’ve seen already in 2022:
• In February, an attack on two companies 
affected the payment processing 
systems of hundreds of gas stations 
in northern Germany. [^1]
• In March, an attack against Greece’s 
postal service temporarily disrupted mail 
delivery and impacted the processing of 
financial transactions. [^2]
• In late May, a ransomware attack against 
Costa Rican government agencies forced 
a national emergency to be declared after 
hospitals were shut down and customs  
and tax collection disrupted. [^3]
• Also in May, an attack caused flight delays and 
cancellations for one of India’s largest airlines, 
leaving hundreds of passengers stranded. [^4]
The success of these attacks and the extent 
of their real-world impacts are the result of 
an industrialization of the cybercrime economy, 
enabling access to tooling and infrastructure and 
expanding cybercriminal capabilities by lowering 
their skill barrier to entry. 
In recent years, ransomware has moved 
from a model where a single “gang” would 
both develop and distribute a ransomware 
payload to the ransomware as a service (RaaS) 
model. RaaS allows one group to manage the 
development of the ransomware payload and 
provide services for payment and extortion via 
data leakage to other cybercriminals—the ones 
who actually launch the ransomware attacks—
referred to as “affiliates” for a cut of the profits. 
This franchising of the cybercrime economy has 
expanded the attacker pool. The industrialization 
of cybercriminal tooling has made it easier for 
attackers to perform intrusions, exfiltrate data, 
and deploy ransomware. 
Human operated ransomware[^5]—a term coined 
by Microsoft researchers to describe threats 
driven by humans who make decisions at every 
stage of the attacks based on what they discover 
in their target’s network and delineate the threat 
from commodity ransomware attacks—remains 
a significant threat to organizations.
