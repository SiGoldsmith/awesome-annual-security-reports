Introduction by Tom Burt 
Corporate Vice President, Customer Security \& Trust 
“The trillions of signals we analyze 
from our worldwide ecosystem 
of products and services reveal the 
ferocity, scope, and scale of digital 
threats across the globe” 
 
A snapshot of our landscape… 
Scope and scale of 
threat landscape 
The volume of password 
attacks has risen to an 
estimated 921 attacks 
every second – a 74% 
increase in just one year.
Dismantling 
cybercrime 
To date, Microsoft 
removed more than 
10,000 domains used 
by cybercriminals and 
600 used by nation 
state actors.
Addressing 
vulnerabilities 
93% of our ransomware 
incident response 
engagements revealed 
insufficient controls 
on privilege access and 
lateral movement.
On February 23, 2022, the cybersecurity world 
entered a new age, the age of the hybrid war. 
On that day, hours before missiles were launched 
and tanks rolled across borders, Russian actors 
launched a massive destructive cyberattack 
against Ukrainian government, technology, and 
financial sector targets. You can read more about 
these attacks and the lessons to be learned 
from them in the Nation State Threats chapter 
of this third annual edition of the Microsoft 
Digital Defense Report (MDDR). Key among 
those lessons is that the cloud provides the best 
physical and logical security against cyberattacks 
and enables advances in threat intelligence and 
end point protection that have proven their value 
in Ukraine. 
While any survey of the year’s developments in 
cybersecurity must begin there, this year’s report 
provides a deep dive into much more. In the 
report’s first chapter, we focus on activities of 
cybercriminals, followed by nation state threats in 
chapter two. Both groups have greatly increased 
the sophistication of their attacks which has 
dramatically increased the impact of their actions. 
While Russia drove headlines, Iranian actors 
escalated their attacks following a transition 
of presidential power, launching destructive 
attacks targeting Israel, and ransomware and 
hack\-and\-leak operations targeting critical 
infrastructure in the United States. China also 
increased its espionage efforts in Southeast 
Asia and elsewhere in the global south, seeking 
to counter US influence and steal critical data 
and information. 
Foreign actors are also using highly effective 
techniques to enable propaganda influence 
operations in regions around the globe, as 
covered in the third chapter. For example, 
Russia has worked hard to convince its citizens, 
and the citizens of many other countries, that 
its invasion of Ukraine was justified – while 
also sowing propaganda discrediting COVID 
vaccines in the West and simultaneously 
promoting their effectiveness at home. 
In addition, actors are increasingly targeting 
Internet of Things (IoT) devices or Operational 
Technology (OT) control devices as entry points 
to networks and critical infrastructure which 
is discussed in chapter four. Finally, in the last 
chapter, we provide the insights and lessons 
we have learned from over the past year 
defending against attacks directed at Microsoft 
and our customers as we review the year’s 
developments in cyber resilience. 
Each chapter provides the key lessons learned 
and insights based on Microsoft’s unique 
vantage point. The trillions of signals we analyze 
from our worldwide ecosystem of products and 
services reveal the ferocity, scope, and scale 
of digital threats across the globe. Microsoft is 
taking action to defend our customers and 
the digital ecosystem against these threats, 
and you can read about our technology that 
identifies and blocks billions of phishing 
attempts, identity thefts, and other threats to 
our customers.

Introduction
We also use legal and technical means to 
seize and shut down infrastructure used by 
cybercriminals and nation state actors and notify 
customers when they are being threatened 
or attacked by a nation state actor. We work 
to develop increasingly effective features 
and services that use AI/ML technology to 
identify and block cyber threats and security 
professionals defend against and identify 
cyber\-intrusions more rapidly and effectively. 
Perhaps most importantly, throughout the MDDR 
we offer our best advice on the steps individuals, 
organizations, and enterprises can take to 
defend against these increasing digital threats. 
Adopting good cyber hygiene practices is the 
best defense and can significantly reduce the 
risk of cyberattacks. 
The state of cybercrime 
Cybercriminals continue to act as sophisticated 
profit enterprises. Attackers are adapting and 
finding new ways to implement their techniques, 
increasing the complexity of how and where 
they host campaign operation infrastructure. 
At the same time, cybercriminals are becoming 
more frugal. To lower their overhead and boost 
the appearance of legitimacy, attackers are 
compromising business networks and devices to 
host phishing campaigns, malware, or even use 
their computing power to mine cryptocurrency.

“The advent of 
cyberweapon 
deployment in 
the hybrid war 
in Ukraine is the 
dawn of a new 
age of conflict.” 
Nation state threats 
Nation state actors are launching increasingly 
sophisticated cyberattacks designed to evade 
detection and further their strategic priorities. 
The advent of cyberweapon deployment in 
the hybrid war in Ukraine is the dawn of a new 
age of conflict. Russia has also supported its 
war with information influence operations, 
using propaganda to impact opinions in Russia, 
Ukraine, and globally. Outside Ukraine, nation 
state actors have increased activity and have 
begun using advancements in automation, cloud 
infrastructure, and remote access technologies to 
attack a wider set of targets. Corporate IT supply 
chains that enable access to ultimate targets 
were frequently attacked. Cybersecurity hygiene 
became even more critical as actors rapidly 
exploited unpatched vulnerabilities, used 
both sophisticated and brute force techniques 
to steal credentials, and obfuscated their 
operations by using opensource or legitimate 
software. In addition, Iran joins Russia in the 
use of destructive cyberweapons, including 
ransomware, as a staple of their attacks. 
These developments require urgent adoption of 
a consistent, global framework that prioritizes 
human rights and protects people from reckless 
state behavior online. All nations must work 
together to implement norms and rules for 
responsible state conduct.

Devices and infrastructure 
The pandemic, coupled with rapid adoption 
of internet\-facing devices of all kinds as a 
component of accelerating digital transformation, 
has greatly increased the attack surface of our 
digital world. As a result, cybercriminals and 
nation states are quickly taking advantage. 
While the security of IT hardware and software 
has strengthened in recent years, the security of 
IoT and OT devices security has not kept pace. 
Threat actors are exploiting these devices to 
establish access on networks and enable lateral 
movement, to establish a foothold in a supply 
chain, or to disrupt the target organization’s 
OT operations.

Introduction
Cyber influence operations
Nation states are increasingly using sophisticated 
influence operations to distribute propaganda 
and impact public opinion both domestically and 
internationally. These campaigns erode trust, 
increase polarization, and threaten democratic 
processes. Skilled Advanced Persistent 
Manipulator actors are using traditional media 
together with internet and social media to vastly 
increase the scope, scale, and efficiency of their 
campaigns, and the outsized impact they are 
having in the global information ecosystem. 
In the past year, we have seen these operations 
used as part of Russia’s hybrid war in Ukraine, 
but have also seen Russia and other nations, 
including China and Iran, increasingly deploy 
propaganda operations powered by social media 
to extend their global influence on a range 
of issues.

Cyber resilience
Security is a key enabler of technological success. 
Innovation and enhanced productivity can only 
be achieved by introducing security measures 
that make organizations as resilient as possible 
against modern attacks. The pandemic has 
challenged us at Microsoft to pivot our security 
practices and technologies to protect our 
employees wherever they work. This past year, 
threat actors continued to take advantage of 
vulnerabilities exposed during the pandemic 
and the shift to a hybrid work environment. 
Since then, our principal challenge has been 
managing the prevalence and complexity of 
various attack methods and increased nation 
state activity. In this chapter, we detail the 
challenges we have faced, and the defenses 
we have mobilized in response with our more 
than 15,000 partners.

Introduction
We believe Microsoft—independently and 
through close partnerships with others in 
private industry, government, and civil society
—has a responsibility to protect the digital 
systems that underpin the social fabric of our 
society and promote safe, secure computing 
environments for every person, wherever they 
are located. This responsibility is the reason we 
have published the MDDR each year since 2020\. 
The report is the culmination of Microsoft’s 
vast data and comprehensive research. It shares 
our unique insights on how the digital threat 
landscape is evolving and the crucial actions that 
can be taken today to improve the security of 
the ecosystem. 
We hope to instill a sense of urgency, so readers 
take immediate action based on the data and 
insights we present both here and in our many 
cybersecurity publications throughout the year. 
As we consider the gravity of the threat to the 
digital landscape—and its translation into the 
physical world—it is important to remember that 
we are all empowered to take action to protect 
ourselves, our organizations, and enterprises 
against digital threats.
Thank you for taking 
the time to review 
this year’s Microsoft 
Digital Defense 
Report. We hope 
you will find that 
it provides valuable 
insight and 
recommendations 
to help us collectively 
defend the digital 
ecosystem. 
Tom Burt 
Corporate Vice President, 
Customer Security \& Trust 
Our objective with this report is twofold:
 
1
To illuminate the evolving digital threat landscape for our customers, 
partners, and stakeholders spanning the broader ecosystem, shining 
a light on both new cyberattacks and evolving trends in historically 
persistent threats.
2
To empower our customers and partners to improve their 
cyber resiliency and respond to these threats.

The RaaS operator develops and maintains the tools to 
power the ransomware operations, including the builders 
that produce the ransomware payloads and payment portals 
for communicating with victims. 
A RaaS program (or syndicate) is an arrangement between 
an operator and an affiliate. The RaaS operator develops and 
maintains the tools to power the ransomware operations, 
including the builders that produce the ransomware 
payloads and payment portals for communicating with 
victims. Many RaaS programs incorporate a suite of 
extortion support offerings, including leak site hosting and 
integration into ransom notes, as well as decryption 
negotiation, payment pressure, and cryptocurrency 
transaction services. 
Affiliates are generally small groups of people “affiliated” 
with one or more RaaS programs. Their role is to deploy the 
RaaS program payloads. Affiliates move laterally in the 
network 
, persist on systems, and exfiltrate data. Each affiliate 
has unique characteristics, such as different ways of doing 
data exfiltration.
Access brokers sell network access to other cybercriminals, 
or gain access themselves via malware campaigns, brute 
force, or vulnerability exploitation. Access broker entities 
can range from large to small. Top tier access brokers 
specialize in high\-value network access, while lower tier 
brokers on the dark web might have just 1–2 usable stolen 
credentials for sale.
Organizations and individuals with weak cybersecurity 
hygiene practices are at greater risk of having their network 
credentials stolen.

Introduction 
Cybercrime continues 
to rise, with increases 
in both random and 
targeted attacks. 
As cyber defenses improve and more 
governments and businesses take a proactive 
approach to prevention, we see attackers using 
two strategies to gain access required to facilitate 
cybercrime. One approach is a campaign with 
broad targets that relies on volume. The other 
uses surveillance and more selective targeting 
to increase the rate of return. Even when revenue 
generation is not the objective—such as nation 
state activity for geopolitical purposes—both 
random and targeted attacks are used. This past 
year, cybercriminals continued to rely on social 
engineering and exploitation of topical issues 
to maximize the success of campaigns. 
For example, while COVID\-themed phishing 
lures were used less frequently, we observed 
lures soliciting donations to support the 
citizens of Ukraine increasing. 
Attackers are adapting and finding new ways 
to implement their techniques, increasing 
the complexity of how and where they host 
campaign operation infrastructure. We have 
observed cybercriminals becoming more 
frugal and attackers are no longer paying for 
technology. To lower their overhead and boost 
the appearance of legitimacy, some attackers 
increasingly seek to compromise businesses to 
host phishing campaigns, malware, or even use 
their computing power to mine cryptocurrency. 
In this chapter, we also examine the rise in 
hacktivism, a disruption caused by private 
citizens conducting cyberattacks to further 
social or political goals. Thousands of individuals 
around the world, both experts and novices, have 
mobilized since February 2022 to launch attacks 
such as disabling websites and leaking stolen 
data as part of the Russia\-Ukraine war. It is too 
soon to predict whether this trend will continue 
after the end of active hostilities. 
Organizations must regularly review and 
strengthen access controls and implement 
security strategies to defend against 
cyberattacks. However, that is not all they 
can do. We explain how our Digital Crimes 
Unit (DCU) has used civil cases to seize malicious 
infrastructure used by cybercriminals and nation 
state actors. We must fight this threat together 
through both public and private partnerships. 
We hope that by sharing what we have learned 
over the past 10 years, we will help others 
understand and consider the proactive measures 
they can take to protect themselves and the 
wider ecosystem against the continually 
growing threat of cybercrime.

Ransomware 
and extortion: 
A nation\-level threat 
Ransomware attacks pose an increased 
danger to all individuals as critical 
infrastructure, businesses of all sizes, 
and state and local governments are 
targeted by criminals leveraging a 
growing cybercriminal ecosystem.
Over the past two years, high profile ransomware 
incidents—such as those involving critical 
infrastructure, healthcare, and IT service 
providers—have drawn considerable public 
attention. As ransomware attacks have become 
more audacious in scope, their effects have 
become more wide ranging. The following are 
examples of attacks we’ve seen already in 2022:
• In February, an attack on two companies 
affected the payment processing 
systems of hundreds of gas stations 
in northern Germany. Note 1
• In March, an attack against Greece’s 
postal service temporarily disrupted mail 
delivery and impacted the processing of 
financial transactions. Note 2 
• In late May, a ransomware attack against 
Costa Rican government agencies forced 
a national emergency to be declared after 
hospitals were shut down and customs 
and tax collection disrupted. Note 3 
• Also in May, an attack caused flight delays and 
cancellations for one of India’s largest airlines, 
leaving hundreds of passengers stranded. Note 4 
The success of these attacks and the extent 
of their real\-world impacts are the result of 
an industrialization of the cybercrime economy, 
enabling access to tooling and infrastructure and 
expanding cybercriminal capabilities by lowering 
their skill barrier to entry. 
In recent years, ransomware has moved 
from a model where a single “gang” would 
both develop and distribute a ransomware 
payload to the ransomware as a service (RaaS) 
model. RaaS allows one group to manage the 
development of the ransomware payload and 
provide services for payment and extortion via 
data leakage to other cybercriminals—the ones 
who actually launch the ransomware attacks—
referred to as “affiliates” for a cut of the profits. 
This franchising of the cybercrime economy has 
expanded the attacker pool. The industrialization 
of cybercriminal tooling has made it easier for 
attackers to perform intrusions, exfiltrate data, 
and deploy ransomware. 
Human operated ransomware Note 5—a term coined 
by Microsoft researchers to describe threats 
driven by humans who make decisions at every 
stage of the attacks based on what they discover 
in their target’s network and delineate the threat 
from commodity ransomware attacks—remains 
a significant threat to organizations.

The State of

Ransomware attacks have become even more 
impactful as the adoption of a double extortion 
monetization strategy has become a standard 
practice. This involves exfiltrating data from 
compromised devices, encrypting the data on 
the devices, and then posting or threatening to 
post the stolen data publicly to pressure victims 
into paying a ransom. 
Although most ransomware attackers 
opportunistically deploy ransomware to 
whatever network they get access, some 
purchase access from other cybercriminals, 
leveraging connections between access 
brokers and ransomware operators.
Our unique breadth of signal 
intelligence is gathered from multiple 
sources—identity, email, endpoints, 
and cloud—and provides insight into 
the growing ransomware economy, 
complete with an affiliate system 
which includes tools designed for 
less technically\-abled attackers.
Expanding relationships between specialized 
cybercriminals have increased the pace, 
sophistication, and success of ransomware 
attacks. This has driven the evolution of the 
cybercriminal ecosystem into connected players 
with different techniques, goals, and skillsets that 
support each other on initial access to targets, 
payment services, and decryption or publication 
tools or sites. 
Ransomware operators can now purchase access 
to organizations or government networks online 
or obtain credentials and access via interpersonal 
relationships with brokers whose main objective 
is solely to monetize the access they have gained.
The operators then use the purchased access to 
deploy a ransomware payload bought via dark 
web marketplaces or forums. In many cases, 
negotiations with victims are conducted by 
the RaaS team, not the operators themselves. 
These criminal transactions are seamless and the 
participants risk little chance of being arrested 
and charged due to the anonymity of the dark 
web and difficulty enforcing laws transnationally.
A sustainable and successful effort against 
this threat will require a whole\-of\-government 
strategy to be executed in close partnership with 
the private sector.
Digital threat activity 
is at an all\-time 
high and the level 
of sophistication 
increases every day.

Understanding the ransomware economy
The RaaS operator develops and maintains the tools to 
power the ransomware operations, including the builders 
that produce the ransomware payloads and payment portals 
for communicating with victims. 
A RaaS program (or syndicate) is an arrangement between 
an operator and an affiliate. The RaaS operator develops and 
maintains the tools to power the ransomware operations, 
including the builders that produce the ransomware 
payloads and payment portals for communicating with 
victims. Many RaaS programs incorporate a suite of 
extortion support offerings, including leak site hosting 
and integration into ransom notes, as well as decryption 
negotiation, payment pressure, and cryptocurrency 
transaction services. 
Affiliates are generally small groups of people “affiliated” 
with one or more RaaS programs. Their role is to deploy the 
RaaS program payloads. Affiliates move laterally in the 
network, persist on systems, and exfiltrate data. Each affiliate 
has unique characteristics, such as different ways of doing 
data exfiltration.
 
Access brokers sell network access to other cybercriminals, 
or gain access themselves via malware campaigns, brute 
force, or vulnerability exploitation. Access broker entities 
can range from large to small. Top tier access brokers 
specialize in high\-value network access, while lower tier 
brokers on the dark web might have just 1–2 usable stolen 
credentials for sale.
Organizations and individuals with weak cybersecurity 
hygiene practices are at greater risk of having their network 
credentials stolen. 
Contrary to how ransomware is sometimes 
portrayed in the media, it is rare for a single 
ransomware variant to be managed by one end\-
to\-end “ransomware gang.” Instead, there are 
separate entities that build malware, gain access 
to victims, deploy ransomware, and handle 
extortion negotiations. The industrialization 
of the criminal ecosystem has led to: 
• Access brokers that break in and hand 
off access (access as a service).
• Malware developers that sell tooling.
• Criminal operators and affiliates that 
conduct intrusions. 
• Encryption and extortion service 
providers that take over monetization 
from affiliates (RaaS).
All human\-operated ransomware campaigns 
share common dependencies on security 
weaknesses. Specifically, attackers usually 
take advantage of an organization’s poor 
cyber hygiene, which often includes infrequent 
patching and failure to implement multifactor 
authentication (MFA).

Case study: The dissolution of Conti
Conti, one of the top ransomware variants 
over the past two years, began shutting down 
operations in mid\-2022, with the Microsoft 
Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) observing 
a significant decrease in activity in late March 
and early April. We observed the last Conti 
ransomware deployments in mid\-April. 
However, much like the shuttering of other 
ransomware operations, Conti’s dissolution did 
not have a significant impact on ransomware 
deployments, as MSTIC observed Conti affiliates 
pivoting to deploy other ransomware payloads, 
including BlackBasta, Lockbit 2\.0, LockbitBlack, 
and HIVE. This is consistent with data from 
previous years and suggests that when 
ransomware gangs go offline, they re\-emerge 
months later or redistribute their technical 
capabilities and resources to new groups.
Our Microsoft threat intelligence teams track 
ransomware threat actors as individual groups 
(labeled as DEVs) based on their specific tools, 
rather than tracking them by the malware they 
use. This meant that when Conti’s affiliates 
dispersed, we were able to continue tracking 
these DEVs through their use of other tools or 
RaaS kits. For example: 
• DEV\-0230, which is affiliated with Trickbot, 
had been a prolific user of Conti. In late April, 
MSTIC observed it using QuantumLocker. 
• DEV\-0237 shifted from Conti’s ransomware 
kit to HIVE and Nokoyawa, including using 
HIVE in the May 31 attack against Costa 
Rican government agencies.
• DEV\-0506, another prolific user of the 
Conti ransomware kit, was observed 
using BlackBasta.
Example of an affiliate (DEV\-0237\) quickly shifting between RaaS programs
After a RaaS program such as Conti is shut down, the ransomware affiliate shifts to another one (Hive) 
almost immediately.
RaaS evolves the ransomware ecosystem 
and hinders attribution
Because human\-operated ransomware is driven 
by individual operators, attack patterns vary 
based on the target and alternate throughout the 
duration of an attack. In the past, we observed 
a close relationship between the initial entry 
vector, tools, and ransomware payload choices 
in each campaign of a single ransomware strain. 
This made attribution easier. The RaaS affiliate 
model, however, decouples this relationship. 
As a result, Microsoft tracks ransomware 
affiliates deploying payloads in specific attacks, 
rather than tracking the ransomware payload 
developers as operators. 
Put another way, we no longer assume the 
HIVE developer is the operator behind a HIVE 
ransomware attack; it is more likely to be 
an affiliate.
The cybersecurity industry has struggled to 
adequately capture this delineation between 
developers and operators. The industry still often 
reports a ransomware incident by its payload 
name, giving the false impression that a single 
entity, or ransomware gang, is behind all attacks 
using that particular ransomware payload, and 
all incidents associated with it share common 
techniques and infrastructure. To support 
network defenders, it is important to learn more 
about the stages that precede different affiliates’ 
attacks—such as data exfiltration and additional 
persistence mechanisms—and the detection and 
protection opportunities that might exist.
More so than malware, attackers 
need credentials to succeed in their 
operations. The successful human 
operated ransomware infection of 
an entire organization relies on access 
to a highly privileged account.

Spotlight on human\-operated 
ransomware attacks
Over the past year, Microsoft’s 
ransomware experts conducted deep 
investigations into more than 100 human\-
operated ransomware incidents to track 
attackers’ techniques and understand 
how to better protect our customers. 
It is important to note that the analysis we 
share here is possible only for onboarded, 
managed, devices. Non\-onboarded, unmanaged 
devices represent the least secure part of an 
organization’s hardware assets.
Most prevalent ransomware 
phase techniques:
75%
 
Use admin tools.
75% 
Use acquired elevated compromised 
user account to spread malicious 
payloads through SMB protocol.
99% 
Attempt to tamper with discovered 
security and backup products using 
OS\-built tools.
The typical human\-operated attack
Human\-operated ransomware attacks can be 
categorized into the pre\-ransomware phase 
and the ransomware deployment phase. 
During the pre\-ransomware phase, attackers 
prepare to infiltrate the network by learning 
about the organization’s typology and 
security infrastructure. 
Stop the attackers before 
they reach the ransomware 
deployment phase
Deployment!
Pre\-ransomware
Ransomware
This phase can range from a few 
days to several weeks or months, 
although it has been shortening 
over the past two years.
This phase 
can last only 
minutes.
Attackers prepare to infiltrate 
the network by learning as much 
as possible about the topology 
and security infrastructure. 
Attackers may also exfiltrate 
data in this phase.
Attackers aim 
to encrypt as 
much data as 
possible. 
Our investigations found most actors behind 
human\-operated ransomware attacks take 
advantage of similar security weaknesses and 
share common attack patterns and techniques. 
A durable security strategy
Combating and preventing attacks of this nature 
requires a shift in an organization’s mindset to 
focus on the comprehensive protection required 
to slow and stop attackers before they can 
move from the pre\-ransomware phase to the 
ransomware deployment phase. 
Enterprises must apply security best practices 
consistently and aggressively to their networks, 
with the goal of mitigating classes of attacks. 
Due to the human decision making these 
ransomware attacks can generate multiple, 
seemingly disparate security product alerts which 
can easily get lost or not responded to in time. 
Alert fatigue is real, and security operations 
centers (SOCs) can make their lives easier by 
looking at trends in their alerts or grouping alerts 
into incidents so they can see the bigger picture. 
SOCs can then mitigate alerts using hardening 
capabilities like attack surface reduction rules. 
Hardening against common threats can not 
only reduce alert volume, but also stop many 
attackers before they get access to networks.
Organizations must maintain 
continuous high standards of 
security posture and network 
hygiene to protect themselves 
from human\-operated 
ransomware attacks.
Actionable insights
Ransomware attackers are motivated by 
easy profits, so adding to their cost via 
security hardening is key in disrupting the 
cybercriminal economy.
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 
Build credential hygiene. More so than 
malware, attackers need credentials to 
succeed in their operations. The successful 
human\-operated ransomware infection of 
an entire organization relies on access to 
a highly privileged account like a Domain 
Administrator, or abilities to edit a Group Policy. 
2 
Audit credential exposure.
3 
Prioritize deployment of Active 
Directory updates.
4 
Prioritize cloud hardening.
5 Reduce the attack surface.
6 
Harden internet\-facing assets and 
understand your perimeter.
 
7 
Reduce SOC alert fatigue by hardening your 
network to reduce volume and preserve 
bandwidth for high priority incidents.

Ransomware insights 
from front\-line 
responders 
Organizations worldwide experienced 
a steady growth in human\-operated 
ransomware attacks beginning in 2019\. 
However, law enforcement operations 
and geopolitical events in the last 
year had a significant impact on 
cybercriminal organizations.
Microsoft’s Security Service Line supports 
customers through an entire cyberattack, from 
investigation to successful containment and 
recovery activities. The response and recovery 
services are offered via two highly integrated 
teams, with one focusing on the investigation and 
groundwork for recovery and the second one on 
containment and recovery. This section presents 
a summary of findings based on ransomware 
engagements over the past year.
93%
 
of Microsoft investigations 
during ransomware recovery 
engagements revealed 
insufficient privilege access 
and lateral movement controls.
Ransomware incident and recovery 
engagements by industry
As new small groups and threats emerge, 
defending teams must be aware of evolving 
ransomware threats while protecting against 
previously unknown ransomware malware 
families. The rapid development approach 
used by criminal groups led to the creation of 
intelligent ransomware packaged in easy\-to\-use 
kits. This allows greater flexibility in launching 
widespread attacks on a higher number 
of targets.
The following pages provide a deeper look at the 
most commonly observed contributing factors to 
weak protection against ransomware, grouped 
into three categories of findings: 
1\. Weak identity controls
2\. Ineffective security operations
3\. Limited data protection
Summary of most common findings in ransomware response engagements 
The most common finding among ransomware incident response engagements was insufficient privilege access 
and lateral movement controls.

The three main contributing 
factors seen in our onsite 
response engagements:
1 Weak identity controls: 
Credential theft attacks remain 
one of the top contributing factors
2 Ineffective security 
operations processes do not just 
present a window of opportunity 
for attackers but significantly 
impact the time to recover
3 Eventually it boils down to 
data—organizations struggle 
to implement an effective data 
protection strategy which aligns 
with their business needs
1 Weak identity controls
Human\-operated ransomware continues to evolve and employ credential theft and lateral 
movement methods traditionally associated with targeted attacks. Successful attacks are often 
the result of long\-running campaigns involving compromise of identity systems, like Active 
Directory (AD), that allow human operators to steal credentials, access systems, and remain 
persistent in the network.
Active Directory (AD) and Azure AD security
88%
 
of impacted customers did not employ AD 
and Azure AD security best practices. This has 
become a common attack vector as attackers 
exploit misconfigurations and weaker security 
postures in critical identity systems to gain 
broader access and impact to businesses.
Least privilege access and use of Privileged 
Access Workstations (PAW)
None of the impacted organizations 
implemented proper administrative credential 
segregation and least privilege access principles 
via dedicated workstations during the 
management of their critical identity and high\-
value assets, such as proprietary systems and 
business\-critical applications.
Privilege account security
88% 
of engagements, MFA was not implemented for 
sensitive and high privileged accounts, leaving 
a security gap for attackers to compromise 
credentials and pivot further attacks using 
legitimate credentials.
84%
 
Administrators across 84 percent of 
organizations did not use privilege identity 
controls such as just\-in\-time access to prevent 
further nefarious use of compromised 
privileged credentials.

2 Ineffective security operations
Our data shows organizations which suffered ransomware attacks have significant gaps in their 
security operations, tooling, and information technology asset lifecycle management. Based on 
the available data, the following gaps were most observed:
Patching:
68%
 
of impacted organizations did not have an 
effective vulnerability and patch management 
process, and a high dependence on manual 
processes versus automated patching led to 
critical openings. Manufacturing and critical 
infrastructure continue to struggle with 
maintenance and patching of legacy 
operational technology (OT) systems.
Lack of security operations tooling: 
Most organizations reported a lack of end\-
to\-end security visibility due to a lack or 
misconfiguration of security tools, leading to a 
decrease in detect and response effectiveness. 
60%
 
of organizations reported no use of an EDR6 
tool, a fundamental technology for detection 
and response. 
60% 
did not invest in security information and 
event management (SIEM) technology leading 
to monitoring silos, limited ability to detect 
end\-to\-end threats and inefficient security 
operations. Automation remains a key gap in 
SOC tooling and processes, forcing SOC staff 
to spend countless hours making sense of 
security telemetry.
84% 
of impacted organizations did not enable 
integration of their multi\-cloud environments 
into their security operations tooling.
Response and recovery processes:
76% 
Lack of an effective response plan was a critical 
area observed in 76 percent of impacted 
organizations, preventing proper organizational 
crisis readiness and negatively impacting time 
to respond and recover. 
3 Limited data protection
Many compromised organizations lacked 
proper data protection processes leading 
to a severe impact on recovery times 
and the capability to return to business 
operations. The most common gaps 
encountered include:
Immutable backup:
44%
 
of organizations did not have immutable 
backups for the impacted systems. Data also 
shows administrators did not have backups and 
recovery plans for critical assets such as AD.
Data loss prevention: 
Attackers usually find their way to compromise 
systems via exploiting vulnerabilities in 
the organization, exfiltrating critical data 
for extortion, intellectual property theft, 
or monetization. 
92%
 
of impacted organizations did not implement 
effective data loss prevention controls 
to mitigate these risks, leading to critical 
data loss.

Ransomware declined in some 
regions and increased in others 
This year we observed a drop in the 
overall number of ransomware cases 
reported to our response teams in North 
America and Europe compared to the 
previous year. At the same time, cases 
reported in Latin America increased.
While law enforcement 
activities likely slowed 
the frequency of attacks 
in 2022, threat actors 
might well develop new 
strategies to avoid being 
caught in the future.
One interpretation of this observation is 
cybercriminals pivoted away from areas 
perceived to have a higher risk of triggering 
law enforcement scrutiny in favor of softer 
targets. Since Microsoft did not observe a 
substantial improvement in enterprise network 
security worldwide to explain the decrease in 
ransomware\-related support calls, we believe 
the most likely cause is a combination of law 
enforcement activity in 2021 and 2022 which 
increased the cost of criminal activity, along with 
some geopolitical events of 2022\. 
One of the most prevalent RaaS operations 
belongs to a Russian\-speaking criminal group 
known as REvil (also known as Sodinokibi) that 
has been active since 2019\. In October 2021, 
REvil’s servers were taken offline as part of 
the international law enforcement Operation 
GoldDust. Note 7 In January 2022, Russia arrested 14 
alleged REvil members and raided 25 locations 
associated with them. Note 8 This was the first time 
Russia acted against ransomware operators 
on its soil.
2X 
Ransomware attacks decreased 
in some regions, but ransom 
demands more than doubled.
While law enforcement activities likely slowed 
the frequency of attacks in 2022, threat actors 
might well develop new strategies to avoid being 
caught in the future. Moreover, tension between 
Russia and the United States over Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine appears to have put an end 
to Russia’s nascent cooperation in the global 
fight against ransomware. After a brief period of 
uncertainty following the REvil arrests, the United 
States and Russia ceased cooperation in pursuing 
ransomware actors, which means cybercriminals 
might view Russia as a safe haven once more.
Looking ahead, we predict the pace of 
ransomware activities will depend on the 
outcome of some key questions:
1\. Will governments take action to prevent 
ransomware criminals from operating within 
their borders, or seek to disrupt actors 
operating from foreign soil? 
2\. Will ransomware groups change tactics to 
remove the need for ransomware and resort 
to extortion style attacks?
3\. Will organizations be able to modernize and 
transform their IT operations faster than 
criminals can exploit vulnerabilities?
4\. Will advancements in tracking and tracing 
ransom payments force ransom recipients 
to change tactics and negotiations?
Actionable insights
 
1 
Focus on holistic security strategies, as all 
of the ransomware families take advantage 
of the same security weaknesses to impact 
a network.
 
2 
Update and maintain security basics to 
increase defense\-in\-depth base level 
of protection and modernize security 
operations. Moving to the cloud allows 
you to detect threats more quickly and 
respond faster.

Cybercrime 
as a service 
Cybercrime as a service (CaaS) is a 
growing and evolving threat to customers 
worldwide. The Microsoft Digital Crimes 
Unit (DCU) observed continued growth 
of the CaaS ecosystem with an increasing 
number of online services facilitating 
various cybercrimes, including BEC 
and human\-operated ransomware. 
Phishing continues to be a preferred 
attack method as cybercriminals 
can acquire significant value from 
successfully stealing and selling 
access to stolen accounts. 
In response to the expanding CaaS market, 
DCU enhanced its listening systems to detect 
and identify CaaS offerings across the entire 
ecosystem of internet, deep web, vetted forums, Note 9 
dedicated websites, online discussion forums, 
and messaging platforms. 
Cybercriminals are now collaborating across time 
zones and languages to deliver specific results. 
For example, one CaaS website administered 
by an individual in Asia maintains operations 
in Europe, and creates malicious accounts in 
Africa. The multi\-jurisdictional nature of these 
operations present complex law and enforcement 
challenges. In response, DCU focuses its efforts 
on disabling malicious criminal infrastructure 
used to facilitate CaaS attacks and collaborating 
with law enforcement agencies around the world 
to hold criminals accountable. 
Cybercriminals are increasingly using analytics to 
maximize reach, scope, and gain. Like legitimate 
businesses, CaaS websites must ensure the 
validity of products and services to maintain a 
solid reputation. For example, CaaS websites 
routinely automate access to compromised 
accounts to ensure the validity of compromised 
credentials. Cybercriminals will discontinue sales 
of specific accounts when passwords are reset or 
vulnerabilities patched. Increasingly, we identified 
CaaS websites providing buyers with on\-demand 
verification as a quality control process. As a 
result, buyers can feel confident the CaaS website 
sells active accounts and passwords while 
reducing potential costs to the CaaS merchant 
if the stolen credentials are remediated prior 
to sale. 
DCU also observed CaaS websites offering 
buyers the option to purchase compromised 
accounts from specific geographic locations, 
designated online service providers, and 
specifically targeted individuals, professions, 
and industries. Frequently ordered accounts 
focus on professionals or departments that 
process invoicing, such as CFOs or “Accounts 
Receivable.” Similarly, industries participating in 
public contracting are often targeted due to the 
quantity of information that is made available 
through the public bidding process. 
DCU investigations into CaaS surfaced 
a number of key trends:
The number and sophistication of services 
is increasing.
One example is the evolution of web shells 
which typically consist of compromised web 
servers used to automate phishing attacks. 
DCU observed CaaS resellers simplifying the 
upload of phishing kits or malware through 
specialized web\-dashboards. CaaS sellers often 
subsequently attempt to sell additional services 
to the threat actor through the dashboard 
such as spam message services and specialized 
spam recipient lists based on defined attributes 
including geographic location or profession. 
In some instances, we observed a single web 
shell being used in multiple attack campaigns, 
which suggests threat actors might maintain 
persistent access to the compromised server. 
We also observed an increase in anonymization 
services available as part of the CaaS ecosystem 
as well as offers for virtual private networks 
(VPN) and virtual private server (VPS) accounts. 
In most instances, the VPN/VPS offered were 
initially procured through stolen credit cards. 
CaaS websites also offered a larger number of 
remote desktop protocol (RDP), secure shell 
(SSH), and cPanels for use as a platform to 
orchestrate cybercrime attacks. CaaS merchants 
configure the RDP, SSH, and cPanels with 
appropriate tools and scripts to facilitate 
various types of cyberattacks. 
Homoglyph domain creation services 
are increasingly requiring payment 
in cryptocurrencies.
Homoglyph domains impersonate legitimate 
domain names by utilizing characters that are 
identical or nearly identical in appearance to 
another character. The aim is to deceive the 
viewer into thinking the homoglyph domain 
is the genuine domain. These domains are a 
ubiquitous threat and a gateway for a significant 
amount of cybercrime. CaaS sites now sell 
custom homoglyph domain names, which allows 
buyers to request specific company and domain 
names to impersonate. After payment is received, 
the CaaS merchants use a homoglyph generator 
tool to select the domain name and then register 
the malicious homoglyph. Payment for this 
service is almost exclusively in cryptocurrency. 
2,750,000 
site registrations successfully 
blocked by DCU this year to get 
ahead of criminal actors that 
planned to use them to engage 
in global cybercrime.

The State of 
Cybercrime
CaaS sellers increasingly offer 
compromised credentials for purchase.
Compromised credentials enable unauthorized 
access to user accounts including email 
messaging service, corporate file sharing 
resources, and OneDrive for Business. 
If administrator credentials are compromised, 
unauthorized users could gain access to 
confidential files, Azure resources, and 
company user accounts. In many instances, 
DCU investigations identified unauthorized use 
of the same credential across multiple servers 
as a means to automate verifying credentials. 
This pattern suggests the compromised user 
might be a victim of multiple phishing attacks or 
have device malware allowing botnet keyloggers 
to collect credentials.
CaaS services and products with enhanced 
features are emerging to avoid detection. 
One CaaS seller offers phishing kits with 
increased layers of complexity and anonymization 
features designed to circumvent detection and 
prevention systems for as little as $6 USD per 
day. The service offers a series of redirects that 
perform checks before allowing traffic to the next 
layer or site. One of these runs over 90 checks 
for fingerprinting the device, including whether it 
is a virtual machine, gathering details about the 
browser and hardware being used, and more. 
If all checks pass, traffic is sent to a landing page 
used for phishing. 
End\-to\-end cybercrime services are selling 
subscriptions to managed services. 
Typically, each step in the commission of 
an online crime can expose threat actors 
if operational security is poor. The risk of 
exposure and identification increases if services 
are purchased from multiple CaaS sites. 
DCU observed a concerning trend in the dark 
web whereby there is an increase in services 
offering to anonymize software code and 
genericize website text to reduce exposure. End\-
to\-end cybercrime subscription service providers 
manage all services and guarantee results which 
further reduce exposure risks to the subscribing 
OCN. The reduced risk has increased the 
popularity of these end\-to\-end services.
Phishing as a service (PhaaS) is one example 
of an end\-to\-end cybercrime service. PhaaS is 
an evolution of prior services known as fully 
undetectable services (FUD) and is offered on a 
subscription basis. Typical PhaaS terms include 
keeping phishing websites active for a month.
DCU also identified a CaaS merchant offering 
distributed denial of service (DDoS) on a 
subscription model. This model outsources 
the creation and maintenance of the botnet 
necessary to carry out attacks to the CaaS 
merchant. Each DDoS subscription customer 
receives an encrypted service to enhance 
operational security and one year of 24/7 
support. The DDoS subscription service offers 
different architectures and attack methods, so 
a purchaser simply selects a resource to attack 
and the seller provides access to an array of 
compromised devices on their botnet to conduct 
the attack. The cost for the DDoS subscription is a 
mere $500 USD. 
DCU’s work to develop tools and techniques 
which identify and disrupt CaaS cybercriminals is 
ongoing. The evolution of CaaS services presents 
significant challenges, particularly in disrupting 
cryptocurrency payments.
PhaaS, cybercriminals offer multiple services within 
a single subscription. In general, a purchaser needs 
to take only three actions: 
1
 
Select a 
phishing site 
template/design 
from among the 
hundreds offered.
2
 
Provide an email 
address to receive 
credentials 
obtained from 
phishing victims.
3
 
Pay the PhaaS 
merchant in 
cryptocurrency.
Once these steps are completed, the PhaaS merchant creates services with three or four layers of redirect and 
hosting resources to target specific users. The campaign is subsequently launched, and victim credentials are 
harvested, verified, and sent to the email address provided by the purchaser. For a premium, many PhaaS 
merchants offer to host phishing sites on the public blockchain so they can be accessed by any browser and 
redirects can point users to a resource on the distributed ledger.

The State of 
Cybercrime
Criminal use of 
cryptocurrencies 
As the adoption of cryptocurrency 
becomes mainstream, criminals are 
increasingly using it to evade law 
enforcement and anti\-money laundering 
(AML) measures. This heightens the 
challenge for law enforcement to track 
and trace cryptocurrency payments 
to cybercriminals.
Worldwide spending on blockchain solutions 
grew by approximately 340 percent over the last 
four years, while new cryptocurrency wallets grew 
by around 270 percent. There are more than 
83 million unique wallets globally, and the total 
market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies was 
approximately $1\.1 trillion USD as of July 28, 2022\. Note 10
Source: Twitter.com—@PeckShieldAlert (PeckShield 
is a China\-based blockchain security company).
Tracking ransomware payments
Ransomware is one of the largest sources of 
illicitly gained cryptocurrency. In an effort to 
disrupt malicious technical infrastructure used in 
ransomware attacks—for example, the disruption 
of Zloader in April 2022 Note 11—Microsoft’s DCU 
tracks criminal wallets to enable cryptocurrency 
tracking and recovery capabilities.
DCU investigators have observed ransomware 
actors evolving their communication tactics with 
victims to conceal the money trail. Originally, 
cybercriminals included Bitcoin addresses in their 
ransom notes. However, this made it easy to 
follow payment transactions on the blockchain, 
so ransomware actors stopped including wallet 
addresses and instead appended email addresses 
or links to chat websites to communicate ransom 
payment addresses to victims. Some actors 
even created unique webpages and logins for 
each victim to prevent security researchers and 
law enforcement from obtaining the criminals’ 
wallet addresses by pretending to be victims. 
Despite criminals’ efforts to hide their tracks, 
some ransom payments can still be recovered 
by working with law enforcement and crypto 
analysis companies that can track movement 
on the blockchain.
Trending: DEX laundering of illicit proceeds
A key issue for cybercriminals is the 
conversion of cryptocurrency to fiat currency. 
Cybercriminals have several potential avenues 
for conversion, each of which carries a different 
degree of risk. One method used to reduce risk 
is to launder proceeds through a decentralized 
exchange (DEX) before cashing out via available 
cash\-out options, such as centralized exchanges 
(CEX), peer\-to\-peer (P2P) and over the counter 
(OTC) exchanges. DEXes are an attractive 
laundering location because they often do not 
follow AML measures.

Tracking illicitly gained cryptocurrency
Using the cryptocurrency investigative tool Chainalysis, Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit discovered the AcendEX 
hackers swapped their stolen funds at a smaller DEX called Curve in addition to Uniswap. This diagram illustrates 
the laundering routes the team uncovered. Each circle represents a cluster of wallets and the numbers on each line 
represent the total amount of Ethereum transmitted for laundering purposes. 
In December 2021, hackers attacked the global 
cryptocurrency trading platform AscendEx 
and stole approximately $77\.7 million USD in 
cryptocurrency belonging to its customers. Note 12 
AscendEx hired blockchain analytics firms and 
contacted other CEXs so the wallets receiving 
stolen funds could be blacklisted. Additionally, 
addresses where the coins were sent were 
labeled as such on the Ethereum blockchain 
explorer Etherscan. Note 13 In order to circumvent 
the alerting and blacklisting, the hackers sent 
$1\.5 million USD in Ethereum to Uniswap, one of 
the world’s largest DEXs, on February 18, 2022\. Note 14
The adoption of stronger AML measures by DEXs 
could blunt laundering activity on their platforms 
and force cybercriminals to use other obfuscation 
methods like coin tumbling or unlicensed 
exchanges. As an example, Uniswap recently 
announced it will start to use blacklists to block 
wallets known to be involved in illicit activities 
from transacting on the exchange. Note 15

If you are a victim of cybercrime who has 
paid the criminal using cryptocurrency, 
contact local law enforcement who might 
be able to help track and recover lost funds.

The State of 
Cybercrime 
The evolving phishing 
threat landscape 
Credential phishing schemes are on 
the rise and remain a substantial threat 
to users everywhere because they 
indiscriminately target all inboxes. 
Among the threats our researchers 
track and protect against, the volume of 
phishing attacks is orders of magnitude 
greater than all other threats. 
Using data from Defender for Office, we see 
malicious email and compromised identity 
activity. Azure Active Directory Identity 
Protection provides still more information 
through compromised identity event alerts. 
Using Defender for Cloud Apps, we see 
compromised identity data access events, and 
Microsoft 365 Defender (M365D) provides 
cross\-product correlation. The lateral movement 
metric comes from Defender for Endpoint (attack 
behavior alerts and events), Defender for Office 
(malicious email) and again M365D for cross\-
product correlation). 
710 million 
phishing emails blocked per week.

private data if you fall victim 
to a phishing email. Note 16
1hr 42m 
The median time for an attacker 
to begin moving laterally within 
your corporate network once a 
device is compromised. Note 17
Microsoft 365 credentials remain one of the most 
highly sought\-after account types for attackers. 
Once login credentials are compromised, 
attackers can log in to corporate\-tied computer 
systems to facilitate infection with malware and 
ransomware, steal confidential company data 
and information by accessing SharePoint files, 
and continue the spread of phish by sending 
additional malicious emails using Outlook, 
among other actions. 
In addition to campaigns with broader targets, 
phishing for credentials, donations, and personal 
information, attackers are targeting selective 
businesses for larger payouts. Email phishing 
attacks against businesses for financial gain 
are collectively referred to as BEC attacks. 
Microsoft detects millions of BEC emails every 
month, equivalent to 0\.6 percent of all phishing 
emails observed. A report from IC3 Note 18 published in 
May 2022 indicates an upward trend in exposed 
losses due to BEC attacks. 
The techniques used in phishing attacks 
continue to increase in complexity. In response 
to countermeasures, attackers adapt new ways 
to implement their techniques and increase 
the complexity of how and where they host 
campaign operation infrastructure. This means 
organizations must regularly reassess their 
strategy for implementing security solutions to 
block malicious emails and strengthen access 
control for individual user accounts.

The State of 
Cybercrime 
We continue to observe a steady year\-over\-year 
increase in phishing emails. The shift to remote 
work in 2020 and 2021 saw a substantial increase 
in phishing attacks aiming to capitalize on the 
changing work environment. Phish operators 
are quick to adopt new email templates using 
lures aligned with major world events such as 
the COVID\-19 pandemic and themes linked 
to collaboration and productivity tools such 
as Google Drive or OneDrive file sharing. 
While COVID\-19 themes have diminished, the 
war in Ukraine became a new lure starting in 
early March 2022\. Our researchers observed a 
staggering increase of emails impersonating 
legitimate organizations soliciting cryptocurrency 
donations in Bitcoin and Ethereum, allegedly to 
support Ukrainian citizens. 
Only a few days after the start of the war in 
Ukraine in late February 2022, the number 
of detected phishing emails containing 
Ethereum addresses encountered across 
enterprise customers increased dramatically. 
Total encounters peaked in the first week of 
March when half a million phishing emails 
contained an Ethereum wallet address. Prior to 
the start of the war, the number of Ethereum 
wallet addresses across other emails detected 
as phish was significantly less, averaging a few 
thousand emails per day. 
Phishing emails with Ethereum wallet addresses 
Total emails detected as phish containing Ethereum wallet addresses increased at the start of the Ukraine\-Russia 
conflict and tapered off after the initial push. 
More than ever, phishers are relying on legitimate 
infrastructure to operate, driving a rise in 
phishing campaigns aimed at compromising 
various aspects of an operation so they do 
not have to purchase, host, or operate their 
own. For example, malicious emails might 
originate from compromised sender accounts. 
Attackers benefit from using these email 
addresses which have a higher reputation score 
and are seen as more trustworthy than newly 
created accounts and domains. In some more 
advanced phishing campaigns, we observed 
attackers preferring to send and spoof from 
domains which have DMARC Note 19 incorrectly set up 
with a “no action” policy, opening the door for 
email spoofing. 
Large phish operations tend to use cloud 
services and cloud virtual machines (VMs) to 
operationalize large scale attacks. Attackers can 
fully automate the process of deploying and 
delivering emails from VMs using SMTP 
email relays or cloud email infrastructure to 
benefit from the high deliverability rates and 
positive reputation of these legitimate services. 
If malicious email is allowed to be sent through 
these cloud services, defenders must rely on 
strong email filtering capabilities to block emails 
from entering their environment. 
Microsoft accounts remain a top target for 
phishing operators, as evidenced by the 
numerous phishing landing pages which 
impersonate the Microsoft 365 login page. 
For example, phishers attempt to match the 
Microsoft login experience in their phish kits 
by generating a unique URL customized to 
the recipient. This URL points to a malicious 
webpage developed to harvest credentials, but 
a parameter in the URL will contain the specific 
recipient’s email address. Once the target 
navigates to the page, the phish kit will pre\-
populate user login data and a corporate logo 
customized to the email recipient, mirroring the 
appearance of the targeted company’s custom 
Microsoft 365 login page.

Cybercrime 
Spotlight on business 
email compromise 
Cybercriminals are developing 
increasingly complex schemes and 
techniques to defeat security settings 
and target individuals, businesses, 
and organizations. We are investing 
significant resources to further 
enhance our BEC enforcement 
program in response. 
BEC is the costliest financial cybercrime, with an 
estimated $2\.4 billion USD in adjusted losses 
in 2021, representing more than 59 percent of 
the top five internet crime losses globally. Note 20 To 
understand the scope of the problem and how 
best to protect users against BEC, Microsoft 
security researchers have been tracking the 
most common themes used in attacks. 
BEC themes (January–June 2022\) 
BEC themes by percentage of occurrence 
BEC trends 
As a point of entry, BEC attackers normally 
attempt to start a conversation with potential 
victims to establish rapport. Posing as a 
colleague or business acquaintance, the attacker 
gradually leads the conversation in the direction 
of a monetary transfer. The introduction email, 
which we track as a BEC lure, represents close to 
80 percent of detected BEC emails. Other trends 
identified by Microsoft security researchers over 
the past year include: 
• The most frequently used techniques in BEC 
attacks observed in 2022 were spoofing Note 21 
and impersonation. Note 22
• The BEC subtype causing the most financial 
damage to victims was invoice fraud (based on 
volume and requested dollar amounts seen in 
our BEC campaign investigations). 
• Business information theft such as accounts 
payable reports and customer contacts enable 
attackers to craft convincing invoice fraud. 
• Most payroll redirection requests were sent 
from free email services and seldom from 
compromised accounts. Email volume from 
these sources spiked around the first and 
fifteenth of each month, the most common 
pay dates. 
• Despite being well\-known avenues for fraud, 
gift card scams comprised only 1\.9 percent of 
the BEC attacks detected. 
Actionable insights 
Defending against phish 
To reduce your organization’s exposure to phish, IT administrators 
are encouraged to implement the following policies and features:
 
1 Require the use of MFA across all accounts 
to limit unauthorized access. 
 
2 
Enable conditional access features for 
highly privileged accounts to block 
access from countries, regions, and IPs 
that do not typically generate traffic at 
your organization. 
 
3 
Consider using physical security keys 
for executives, employees involved in 
payment or purchase activities, and other 
privileged accounts.
 
4 
Enforce the use of browsers which support 
services such as Microsoft SmartScreen 
to analyze URLs for suspicious behaviors 
and blocks access to known malicious 
websites. Note 23
 
5 
Use a machine\-learning based security 
solution that quarantines high probability 
phish and detonates URLs and 
attachments in a sandbox before email 
reaches the inbox, such as Microsoft 
Defender for Office 365\. Note 24
 
6 
Enable impersonation and 
spoofing protection features across 
your organization.
 
7 
Configure DomainKeys Identified Mail 
(DKIM) and Domain\-based Message 
Authentication Reporting \& Conformance 
(DMARC) action policies to prevent 
delivery of non\-authenticated emails that 
might be spoofing reputable senders.
 
8 Audit tenant and user created allow 
rules and remove broad domain and 
IP based exceptions. These rules often 
take precedence and can allow known 
malicious emails through email filtering.
 
9 Regularly run phishing simulators to 
gauge the potential risk across your 
organization and to identify and educate 
vulnerable users.

The State of 
Cybercrime 
Homoglyph deception 
BEC and phishing are common social 
engineering tactics. Social engineering 
plays a significant role in crime, 
persuading a target to interact 
with the criminal by gaining trust. 
In physical commerce, trademarks are used 
to secure trust in the origin of a product or 
service, and counterfeit products are an abuse 
of the trademark. Similarly, cybercriminals pose 
as a contact familiar to the target during a 
phishing attack, using homoglyphs to deceive 
potential victims. 
A homoglyph is a domain name used for email 
communication in BEC, in which a character 
is replaced by one that is identical or nearly 
identical in appearance, in order to deceive 
the target. 
Homoglyph techniques used in BEC attempts 
BEC generally has two phases, the first of which 
involves compromise of credentials. These types 
of credential leaks can be a result of phishing 
attacks or large data breaches. The credentials 
are then sold or traded on the dark web. 
The second phase is the fraud phase, 
where attackers use compromised credentials 
to engage in sophisticated social engineering 
using homoglyph email domains.

Analysis of over 1,700 homoglyph domains between 
January–July 2022\. While 170 homoglyph techniques 
were used, 75% of domains used just 14 techniques. 
A homoglyph in action 
A homoglyph domain that looks identical to a 
mail domain the victim recognizes is registered 
on a mail provider with a username that is 
identical. A hijacked email is then sent from the 
hijacked domain with new payment instructions. 
Leveraging open\-source intelligence and 
access to email threads, the criminal identifies 
individuals who have responsibility for 
invoicing and payments. They then create 
an impersonation of an email address of the 
individual sending invoices. This impersonation 
is composed of an identical username and 
mail domain that is a homoglyph of the 
genuine sender. 
The attacker copies an email chain containing 
a legitimate invoice, then changes the invoice 
to contain their own bank details. This new, 
modified invoice is then resent from the 
homoglyph impersonation email to the target. 
Because the context makes sense and the email 
looks genuine, often the target follows the 
fraudulent instructions.

The State of 
Cybercrime 
A timeline of botnet disruption from 
Microsoft’s early days of collaboration 
For more than a decade, DCU has worked to 
proactively stop cybercrime resulting in 26 malware 
and nation state disruptions. As the DCU team 
uses more advanced tactics and tools to shut down 
these illicit operations, we see the cybercriminals 
also evolve their approaches in an attempt to stay 
a step head. Here is a timeline showing a sample 
of the botnets disrupted by DCU and the strategies 
Microsoft adopted to shut them down. 
2008 
Conficker botnet 
Description: A fast\-spreading worm 
targeting the Windows OS, infecting 
millions of computers and devices in 
a common network; created network 
outages worldwide. 
Collaboration: Formation of 
the Conficker Working Group, 
the first consortium of its kind. 
Microsoft partnered with 16 
organizations across the globe 
to defeat the bot. 
Microsoft response: The 
group collaborated across many 
international jurisdictions and was 
successful bringing Conficker down. 
2009 
Waledac botnet 
Description: A complex spam 
botnet with US domains that 
collected email addresses and 
distributed spam that infected up to

The State of 
Cybercrime 
Cybercriminal abuse 
of infrastructure 
Internet gateways 
as criminal command 
and control infrastructure 
IoT devices are becoming an increasingly 
popular target for cybercriminals using 
widespread botnets. When routers are 
unpatched and left exposed directly to 
the internet, threat actors can abuse 
them to gain access to networks, 
execute malicious attacks, and even 
support their operations. 
The Microsoft Defender for IoT team conducts 
research on equipment ranging from legacy 
industrial control system controllers to cutting 
edge IoT sensors. The team investigates IoT\- and 
OT\-specific malware to contribute to the shared 
list of indicators of compromise. 
Routers are particularly vulnerable attack vectors 
because they are ubiquitous across internet 
connected homes and organizations. We have 
been tracking the activity of MikroTik routers, a 
popular router around the world residentially and 
commercially, identifying how they are utilized for 
command and control (C2\), domain name system 
(DNS) attacks, and crypto mining hijacking. 
More specifically, we identified how Trickbot 
operators utilize compromised MikroTik routers 
and reconfigure them to act as part of their C2 
infrastructure. The popularity of these devices 
compounds the severity of their abuse by 
Trickbot, and their unique hardware and software 
enable threat actors to evade traditional security 
measures, expand their infrastructure, and 
compromise more devices and networks. 
Distribution of exposed MikroTik routers 
around the world 
93,868

Number of exposed 
MikroTik routers
Exposed routers are at risk of having potential 
vulnerabilities exploited. 
By tracking and analyzing traffic containing 
secure shell (SSH) commands, we observed 
attackers using MikroTik routers to 
communicate with Trickbot infrastructure after 
obtaining legitimate credentials to devices. 
These credentials can be obtained through brute 
force attacks, exploiting known vulnerabilities 
with readily available patches, and using 
default passwords. Once a device is accessed, 
the attacker issues a unique command that 
redirects traffic between two ports in the router, 
establishing the line of communication between 
Trickbot\-affected devices and the C2\.

We have aggregated our knowledge of the 
various methods of attacking MikroTik devices, 
beyond just Trickbot, as well as known common 
vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) into an 
open\-source tool for MikroTik devices, which can 
extract the forensic artifacts related to attacks on 
these devices. Note 31
Devices acting as reverse proxies for malware 
C2 are not just unique to Trickbot and MikroTik 
routers. In collaboration with the Microsoft 
RiskIQ team, we traced back to the C2 involved 
and, through observing SSL certificates, 
identified Ubiquiti and LigoWave devices 
that are impacted as well. Note 32 This is a strong 
indication that IoT devices are becoming active 
components of nation state coordinated attacks 
and a popular target for cybercriminals using 
widespread botnets.

The State of 
Cybercrime 
Crypto criminals 
abusing IoT devices 
Gateway devices are an increasingly 
valuable target for threat actors as the 
number of known vulnerabilities has 
grown consistently from year to year. 
They are being used for crypto mining 
and other types of malicious activity. 
As cryptocurrency has become more popular, 
many individuals and organizations have invested 
computational power and network resources 
from devices such as routers to mine coins on 
the blockchain. However, mining cryptocurrency 
is a time\- and resource\-intensive process 
with a low probability of success. To increase 
the likelihood of mining a coin, miners pool 
together in distributed, cooperative networks, 
receiving hashes relative to the percentage of 
the coin they succeeded in mining with their 
connected resources. 
In the past year, Microsoft observed a growing 
number of attacks that abuse routers for 
redirecting cryptocurrency mining efforts. 
Cybercriminals compromise routers connected 
to mining pools and redirect mining traffic 
to their associated IP addresses with DNS 
poisoning attacks, which alters the DNS settings 
of targeted devices. Affected routers register 
the wrong IP address to a given domain name, 
sending their mining resources—or hashes—to 
pools used by threat actors. These pools might 
mine anonymous coins associated with criminal 
activities or use legitimate hashes generated by 
miners to acquire a percentage of the coin that 
they mined, thus reaping the rewards. 
With more than half of known 
vulnerabilities found in 2021 lacking a 
patch, updating and securing routers 
on corporate and private networks 
remains a significant challenge for 
device owners and administrators. 
Compromising devices for illegal crypto mining. 
27 
Portion of hashes from 
original pool are stolen 
by threat actors, or 
resources are transferred 
to their pool, or routers 
have malware on them 
that steal resources 
for mining. 
DNS poisoning of gateway devices compromises legitimate mining activities and redirects resources 
to criminal mining activities. 
Virtual machines as 
criminal infrastructure 
The widespread move to the cloud 
includes cybercriminals who leverage 
private assets of unwitting victims 
obtained through phishing or 
distributing malware credential stealers. 
Many cybercriminals are choosing to 
set up their malicious infrastructures 
on cloud\-based virtual machines (VMs), 
containers, and microservices. 
Once the cybercriminal has access, a sequence of 
events can occur to set up infrastructure—such 
as a series of virtual machines through scripting 
and automated processes. These scripted, 
automated processes are used to launch 
malicious activity including large scale email 
spam attacks, phishing attacks, and web pages 
hosting nefarious content. It can even include 
setting up a scaled virtual environment carrying 
out cryptocurrency mining, causing the end 
victim a bill of hundreds of thousands of dollars 
at the end of the month. 
Cybercriminals understand their malicious activity 
has a limited life span before it is detected and 
shut down. As a result, they have scaled up and 
now operate proactively with contingencies top 
of mind. They have been observed preparing 
compromised accounts ahead of time and 
monitoring their environments. As soon as an 
account (set up using hundreds of thousands of 
virtual machines) is detected, they traverse to 
the next account—already prepared by scripts to 
be immediately activated—and their malicious 
activity continues with little to no interruption. 
Like cloud infrastructure, on\-premises 
infrastructure can be used in attacks with 
virtual local environments that are unknown to 
the on\-premises user. This requires the initial 
access point to remain open and accessible. 
On\-premises private assets have also been 
abused by cybercriminals to initiate an onward 
chain of cloud infrastructure, set up to obfuscate 
their origin to avoid suspicious infrastructure 
creation detection. 
Actionable insights
 
1 
Implement good cyber hygiene and 
provide cybersecurity training for 
employees with guidance for avoiding 
being socially engineered. 
 
2 
Conduct regular automated user activity 
anomaly checks through detections at 
scale to help reduce these types of attacks.
 
3 
Update and secure routers on corporate 
and private networks.

The State of 
Cybercrime 
Is hacktivism 
here to stay? 
While hacktivism is not a new 
phenomenon, the war in Ukraine saw 
a surge of volunteer hackers, including 
some directed by governments to deploy 
cyber tools to damage the reputation 
or assets of political opponents, 
organizations, and even nation states. 
In February 2022, the Ukrainian government 
called on private civilians around the world 
to conduct cyberattacks on Russia as part of 
its 300,000 strong “IT Army.” Note 33 At the same 
time, established hacktivist groups such as 
Anonymous, Ghostsec, Against the West, 
Belarusian Cyber Partisans, and RaidForum2 
began conducting attacks in support of Ukraine. 
Other groups, including some of the Conti 
ransomware gang, sided with Russia. Note 34
In the months that followed, Anonymous’s 
activities were highly visible. Hackers acting 
in the group’s name—or in that of one of its 
affiliates—temporarily disabled thousands of 
Russian and Belarusian websites, leaked hundreds 
of gigabytes of stolen data, hacked Russian TV 
channels to play pro\-Ukrainian content, and 
even offered to pay Bitcoin for surrendered 
Russian tanks. 
The rise of citizen hackers 
Social media platforms enabled the rapid 
organization and mobilization of thousands 
of would\-be citizen hackers, who were 
provided directions for conducting easily 
executable attacks such as DDoS attacks. 
Organizers leveraged Twitter, Telegram, and 
private forums to rally hackers, organize 
operations, and disseminate hacking 
instruction manuals. 
However, most of these hackers likely have 
limited skills, even with instruction. This suggests 
two potential futures: one in which hundreds 
or thousands of individuals with rudimentary 
technical capabilities use attack templates 
to conduct future coordinated or individual 
hacktivist attacks against targets, or a second 
future where the eventual end of hostilities 
in Ukraine sees them leaving their hacktivism 
behind, at least until the next political or social 
issue inspires them to action. 
Politicization of hackers 
The greater risk posed by this political 
mobilization is the deployment of tech\-savvy 
hackers who might continue to conduct 
cyberattacks against foreign government targets 
to support their own national priorities, either 
on a self\-initiated basis or at the behest of 
their government. 
Iran, China, and Russia already use hacktivism 
as a feeder for recruitment into their state 
hacking groups. For example, in April 2022, the 
pro\-Russian hacking group Killnet launched 
DDoS attacks against Czech railroads, regional 
airports, and Czechia’s civil service server, even 
though Czechia is not directly involved in the 
war. Note 35 At the same time, some governments 
might use hacktivism as a cover for traditional 
cyberespionage or sabotage operations—for 
example, Iranian activities against Israel. 
In an environment of increased DDoS attacks 
linked to hacktivism, the technology industry is 
challenged to quickly decipher the difference 
between normal and abnormal traffic flow 
to a website. Microsoft and its partners have 
developed a collection of tools which distinguish 
malicious DDoS traffic and trace it back to its 
origin. In addition, Microsoft’s Azure platform can 
identify machines on the platform that produce 
extraordinarily high levels of outbound traffic 
and shut them down. 
Emergence of protestware 
Protestware has emerged as a direct result of 
emotional reactions to the war between Russia 
and Ukraine. Some open source software 
developers used the popularity of their software 
as a means to speak up or take action against 
an unfolding geopolitical situation. This included 
harmless text files opened on a desktop or a 
browser to spread messages of peace, but also 
included targeted attacks based on IP address 
geolocation and destructive actions such as 
wiping a hard drive. As other global events 
unfold, we can expect to see protestware surface 
again in the future. Since these are generally 
cases where well\-respected open\-source 
maintainers are deciding to make personal 
statements using their own open source 
components, there is currently no protection 
in place to stop these types of changes from 
occurring in the source file packages and users 
should maintain awareness of potential impact. 
Social media platforms enabled the 
organization and mobilization of 
thousands of would\-be citizen hackers, 
who were provided directions for 
conducting easily executable attacks 
such as DDoS attacks. 
Actionable insights
 
1 
The technology industry must come 
together to design a comprehensive 
response to this new threat. 
 
2 
Leading technology companies, including 
Microsoft, have tools to identify malicious 
traffic associated with DDoS attacks and 
disable the responsible machines. 
 
3 
Open source users should keep a 
heightened watch during times of 
geopolitical strife.

An overview of 
Nation State Threats 
Nation state actors are 
launching increasingly 
sophisticated cyberattacks 
to evade detection and further 
their strategic priorities. 
The advent of cyberweapon 
deployment in the hybrid 
war in Ukraine is the dawn 
of a new age of conflict. 
Russia has also supported its war with 
information influence operations, using 
propaganda to impact opinions in Russia, in 
Ukraine, and globally. This first full\-scale hybrid 
conflict has taught other important lessons. 
First, the security of digital operations and data 
can be best protected – both in cyberspace 
and in physical space – by moving to the cloud. 
Initial Russian attacks targeted on\-premises 
services with wiper malware, and targeted 
physical data centers with one of the first 
missiles launched. 
Ukraine responded by rapidly moving workloads 
and data to hyperscale clouds hosted in data 
centers outside Ukraine. Second, advances in 
cyber threat intelligence and endpoint protection 
powered by the data and advanced AI and ML 
services in the cloud have helped Ukraine defend 
against Russian cyberattacks. 
Elsewhere, nation state actors have increased 
activity and are using advancements in 
automation, cloud infrastructure, and remote 
access technologies to attack a wider set 
of targets. Corporate IT supply chains that 
enable access to ultimate targets were 
frequently attacked. Cyber security hygiene 
became even more critical as actors rapidly 
exploited unpatched vulnerabilities, used both 
sophisticated and brute force techniques to steal 
credentials, and obfuscated their operations 
by using opensource or legitimate software. 
And Iran joins Russia in use of destructive 
cyberweapons, including ransomware, 
as a staple of their attacks. 
These developments require urgent adoption 
of a consistent, global framework that prioritizes 
human rights and protects people from reckless 
state behavior online. All nations must work to 
implement agreed upon norms and rules for 
responsible state conduct.

Introduction 
Following high\-profile 
attacks in 2020 and 2021, 
nation state threat actors 
spent significant resources 
adapting to new security 
protections implemented 
by organizations to defend 
against sophisticated threats. 
Much like enterprise organizations, adversaries 
began using advancements in automation, cloud 
infrastructure, and remote access technologies 
to extend their attacks against a wider set of 
targets. These tactical adjustments resulted in 
new approaches and large scale attacks against 
corporate supply chains. IT security hygiene 
took on an even higher degree of importance 
as actors developed new ways to rapidly exploit 
unpatched vulnerabilities, expanded techniques 
for compromising corporate networks, and 
obfuscated their operations by using opensource 
or legitimate software. New attack techniques 
provided new and harder\-to\-detect vectors 
to gain access to a target’s network. Finally, 
as wartime physical attacks escalated, we 
saw cyberattacks take a prominent role in 
military activity. 
The conflict in Ukraine has provided an all\-
too\-poignant example of how cyberattacks 
evolve to impact the world in parallel with 
military conflict on the ground. Power systems, 
telecommunication systems, media, and 
other critical infrastructure all became targets 
of both physical attacks and cyberattacks. 
Network compromise attempts commonly 
observed as part of espionage and information 
exfiltration campaigns became focused in hybrid 
war on destructive wiper malware attacks against 
critical infrastructure systems. Connecting the 
security of these systems to the cloud resulted 
in early detection and disruption of potentially 
devastating attacks. Note 1
 
For the first time in a major cyber event, 
behavioral detections leveraging machine 
learning used known attack patterns to 
successfully identify and stop further attacks 
without prior knowledge of the underlying 
malware—even before humans were aware 
of the threats. We also confirmed the value 
of sharing threat intelligence in real\-time with 
defenders protecting these systems, giving 
them vital information to anticipate and 
defend against active attacks. 
Nation state threat actors around the world 
continue to expand their operations in new 
and old ways. China, North Korea, Iran, and 
Russia all carried out attacks on Microsoft 
customers. The IT services supply chain became 
a common target as actors shifted the focus 
to upstream services that can be access points 
to multiple organizations. We expect actors 
to continue to exploit trusted relationships 
in enterprise supply chains, emphasizing the 
importance of comprehensive enforcement 
of authentication rules, diligent patching, 
and account configuration for remote access 
infrastructure, and frequent audits of partner 
relationships to verify authenticity. 
Nation state actors, much like ransomware and 
criminal operators, have responded to increased 
exposure by moving toward targeting poorly 
configured or unpatched enterprise systems 
(VPN/VPS infrastructure, on\-premises servers, 
third\-party software) to perform living\-off\-
the\-land attacks. Many have increased use of 
commodity malware and open source red team 
tools to obfuscate their malicious activity. 
As a result, maintaining a strong baseline of IT 
security hygiene through prioritized patching, 
enabling anti\-tamper features, using attack 
surface management tools like RiskIQ to get 
an outside\-in view of an attack surface, and 
enabling multifactor authentication across 
the full enterprise have become baseline 
fundamentals to proactively defend against 
many sophisticated actors. 
Nation state actors have also increased 
use of ransomware as a tactic in their attacks, 
often reusing ransom malware created by that 
criminal ecosystem in their attacks. We have 
seen both Iran\- and North Korea\-based actors, 
leveraging commodity ransomware tools to 
damage targeted systems, often including 
critical infrastructure, within regional rivals. 
Finally, we have seen the growing threat of 
cyber mercenaries developing and selling 
tools, techniques, and services to extend 
exploits against vulnerable third\-party solutions. 
The sophistication and agility of attacks by nation 
state actors will continue to evolve each year. 
Organizations must respond by being informed 
of these actor changes and evolve defenses 
in parallel.

Threats 
Background on 
nation state data 
Nation state threats are cyber threat 
activities that originate in a specific country 
with the apparent intent of furthering 
national interests. Nation state actors 
present some of the most advanced and 
persistent threats our customers face, 
including intellectual property theft, 
espionage, surveillance, credential theft, 
destructive attacks, and more. 
We invest significant resources in discovering, 
understanding, and countering these threats. 
When an organization or individual account 
holder is targeted or compromised by observed 
nation state activities, Microsoft delivers an 
alert in the form of a nation state notification 
(NSN) directly to the customer, including the 
information they need to investigate the activity. 
As of June 2022, we had delivered over 67,000 
NSNs since we began in 2018\. 
Microsoft NSN alert data are presented in 
this chapter to provide a view of measurable 
activity. The level of nation state activity shown 
in the charts is based on the number of NSNs 
Microsoft issued to customers in response to 
the detection of nation state actors targeting 
or compromising at least one account in the 
customer organization. 
The four primary nation states whose threat 
groups we include in this report are Russia, 
China, Iran, and North Korea. These represent 
the countries of origin for the most commonly 
observed actors targeting Microsoft customers 
over the past year. The report also includes our 
observations about threat groups from Lebanon 
and from cyber mercenaries, or private sector 
offensive actors for hire. 
Microsoft identifies nation state groups by 
chemical element names (such as NOBELIUM), 
just some of which are shown on the following 
page. We use DEV\-\#\#\#\# designations as a 
temporary name given to an unknown, emerging, 
or developing cluster of threat activity, allowing 
us to track it as a unique set of information until 
we reach a high degree of confidence about the 
origin or identity of the actor behind the activity. 
Once it meets the criteria, a DEV is converted 
to a named actor or merged with existing actors. 
Throughout this chapter, we cite examples of 
nation state and DEV groups to provide a deeper 
view into attack targets, techniques, and analysis 
of motivations. Although many of these groups 
use the same tools as cybercriminals, they 
present unique threats in the form of bespoke 
malware, the ability to discover and capitalize 
on zero\-day vulnerabilities, and legal impunity.

The evolving 
threat landscape 
Microsoft’s mission to track nation state 
actor activity and notify customers 
when we see them being targeted or 
compromised is rooted in our mission 
to protect our customers from attacks. 
This notification is a crucial part of our 
commitment to informing customers whether 
observed attacks are successfully prevented 
by our security product protections, or if the 
attacks are effective because of unknown 
security weaknesses. Tracking notifications over 
time helps Microsoft identify evolving threat 
trends by actors and focus product protections 
on proactively mitigating threats to customers 
across our cloud services. 
This tracking also allows us to share data 
and insights about what we see. The analysts 
tracking these actors and following their attacks 
rely on a combination of technical indicators 
and geopolitical expertise to understand 
the motivations of the actors, combining 
technical and global context into new insights. 
This curation provides a unique view into the 
priorities of nation state cyber actors and how 
their motivations might mirror the political, 
military, and economic priorities of the nation 
states employing them. 
Political developments in the past year have 
shaped the priorities and risk tolerance of 
state\-sponsored threat groups worldwide. 
As geopolitical relationships have broken 
down and hawkish elements have acquired 
more control in some nations, cyber actors 
have become more brazen and aggressive. 
For example: 
• Russia relentlessly targeted the Ukrainian 
government and the country’s critical 
infrastructure to complement its on\-the\-
ground military action. Note 2
• Iran aggressively sought inroads into US 
critical infrastructure such as port authorities. 
• 
• 
Although nation state actors can be technically 
sophisticated and employ a wide variety of 
tactics, their attacks can often be mitigated by 
good cyber hygiene. Many of these actors rely on 
relatively low\-tech means, such as spear\-phishing 
emails, to deliver sophisticated malware instead 
of investing in developing customized exploits 
or using targeted social engineering to achieve 
their objectives.

Nation state groups targeted a range of sectors. Russian and Iranian state actors targeted the IT industry as a 
means to access the IT firms’ customers. Think tanks, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), universities, and 
government agencies remained other common targets of nation state actors. 
Nation state actors have a variety of objectives 
that can result in targeting specific groups 
of organizations or individuals. In the last 
year, supply chain attacks have increased, 
with a particular focus on IT companies. 
By compromising IT service providers, threat 
actors are often able to reach their original 
target through a trusted relationship with the 
company that manages connected systems, 
or potentially execute attacks on a much larger 
scale by compromising hundreds of downstream 
customers in one attack. After the IT sector, the 
most frequently targeted entities were think 
tanks, academics attached to universities, and 
government officials. These are desirable “soft 
targets” for espionage to collect intelligence 
on geopolitical issues.

data needed to stay inside a country in order to be secure. 
After the invasion, migrating data to the cloud and moving 
outside territorial borders is now a part of resiliency

The IT supply chain 
as a gateway to the 
digital ecosystem 
Nation state targeting of IT service 
providers might enable the threat actors 
to exploit other organizations of interest 
by taking advantage of trust and access 
granted to these supply chain providers. 
In the past year, nation state cyber threat 
groups targeted IT services providers to 
attack third\-party targets and gain access 
to downstream clients in government, 
policy, and critical infrastructure sectors. 
IT service providers are attractive intermediary 
targets as they serve hundreds of direct and 
thousands of indirect clients of interest to 
foreign intelligence services. If exploited, the 
routine business practices and the delegated 
administrative privileges these firms enjoy, might 
allow malicious actors to access and manipulate 
IT service provider client networks without 
immediately triggering alerts. 
In the past year, NOBELIUM attempted to 
compromise and leverage privileged accounts 
at cloud solutions and other managed services 
providers to attempt targeted downstream 
access into primarily US and European 
government and policy customers. 
NOBELIUM demonstrated how a “compromise 
one to compromise many” approach could 
be directed against a perceived geopolitical 
adversary. This past year, the threat actor pursued 
both third\-party and direct intrusions into 
sensitive organizations based in member states 
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), 
which the Russian government perceives as an 
existential threat. Between July 2021 and early 
June 2022, 48 percent of Microsoft’s customer 
notifications of Russian threat activity against 
online services customers went to IT sector 
firms based in NATO member countries, likely as 
intermediary access points. Overall, 90 percent 
of notifications about Russian threat activity 
during the same period went to customers based 
in NATO member states, primarily in the IT, 
think tanks and nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs), and government sectors, suggesting 
a strategy of pursuing multiple means of initial 
access to these targets.
There has been a shift from 
exploiting the software supply chain 
to exploiting the IT services supply 
chain, targeting cloud solutions and 
managed services providers to reach 
downstream customers. 
Approaches to compromise 
This diagram depicts NOBELIUM’s multi\-vectored approach to compromising its ultimate targets and the collateral 
damage to other victims along the way. In addition to the actions shown above, NOBELIUM launched password 
spray and phishing attacks against the entities involved, even targeting the personal account of at least one 
government employee as another potential route to compromise.

Threats 
Throughout the year, Microsoft Threat 
Intelligence Center (MSTIC) detected an 
increasing number of Iranian state and Iran\-
affiliated actors compromising IT companies. 
In many cases, actors were detected stealing 
sign\-in credentials to gain access to downstream 
clients for a range of objectives, from intelligence 
collection to retaliatory destructive attacks. 
• In July and August 2021, DEV\-0228 
compromised an Israeli business software 
provider to later compromise downstream 
customers in the Israeli defense, energy, 
and legal sectors. Note 4 
• From August to September 2021, Microsoft 
detected a spike in Iranian state actors 
targeting IT companies based in India. The lack 
of pressing geopolitical issues that would have 
prompted such a shift suggests this targeting 
is for indirect access to subsidiaries and clients 
outside India. 
• In January 2022, DEV\-0198, a group we 
assess is affiliated with the government of 
Iran, compromised an Israeli cloud solutions 
provider. Microsoft assesses the actor 
likely used compromised credentials from 
the provider to authenticate into an Israeli 
logistics company. MSTIC observed the same 
actor attempting to conduct a destructive 
cyberattack against the logistics company 
later that month. 
• In April 2022, POLONIUM, a Lebanon\-based 
group we assess collaborated with Iranian 
state groups on IT supply chain techniques, 
compromised another Israeli IT company 
to gain access to Israeli defense and legal 
organizations. Note 5 
This past year of activity demonstrates that 
threat actors like NOBELIUM and DEV\-0228 
are getting to know the landscape of an 
organization’s trusted relationships better than 
the organizations themselves. This increased 
threat emphasizes the need for organizations 
to understand and harden the borders and entry 
points of their digital estates. It also underscores 
the importance for IT service providers to 
rigorously monitor their own cybersecurity 
health. For example, organizations should 
implement multifactor authentication and 
conditional access policies that make it harder 
for malicious actors to capture privileged 
accounts or spread throughout a network. 
Conducting a thorough review and audit 
of partner relationships helps minimize any 
unnecessary permissions between your 
organization and upstream providers and 
immediately remove access for any relationships 
that look unfamiliar. Increasing familiarity with 
activity logs and reviewing available activity 
makes it easier to spot anomalies that could 
spark further investigation. 
Nation state targeting of third parties 
enables them to exploit sensitive 
organizations by taking advantage 
of trust and access in a supply chain. 
Actionable insights
 
1 
Review and audit upstream and downstream 
service provider relationships and delegated 
privilege accesses to minimize unnecessary 
permissions. Remove access for any partner 
relationships that look unfamiliar or have not 
yet been audited. Note 6 
 
2 
Enable logging and review all authentication 
activity for remote access infrastructure and 
virtual private networks (VPNs), with a focus 
on accounts configured with single factor 
authentication, to confirm authenticity and 
investigate anomalous activity.
 
3 
Enable MFA for all accounts (including 
service accounts) and ensure MFA is 
enforced for all remote connectivity.
 
4 
Use passwordless solutions to 
secure accounts. Note 7

Threats 
Rapid vulnerability 
exploitation 
As organizations strengthen their 
cybersecurity postures, nation state 
actors respond by pursuing new and 
unique tactics to deliver attacks and 
evade detection. The identification and 
exploitation of previously unknown 
vulnerabilities—known as zero\-day 
vulnerabilities—is a key tactic in this effort. 
Zero\-day vulnerabilities are a particularly 
effective means for initial exploitation and, once 
publicly exposed, vulnerabilities can be rapidly 
reused by other nation state and criminal actors. 
The number of publicly disclosed zero\-day 
vulnerabilities over the past year is on par with 
those from the previous year, which was the 
highest on record. 
As cyber threat actors—both nation state 
and criminal—become more adept at 
leveraging these vulnerabilities, we have 
observed a reduction in the time between 
the announcement of a vulnerability and 
the commoditization of that vulnerability. 
This makes it essential that organizations patch 
exploits immediately. Similarly, it is critical 
that organizations or individuals that uncover 
new vulnerabilities responsibly disclose or 
report them to affected vendors as soon as 
possible, in line with coordinated vulnerability 
disclosure procedures. 
This ensures that vulnerabilities are identified, 
and patches developed in a timely manner 
to protect customers from previously 
unknown threats. 
Many organizations assume they are less likely 
to be a victim of zero\-day exploit attacks if 
vulnerability management is integral to their 
network security. However, the commoditization 
of exploits is leading them to come at a much 
faster rate. Zero\-day exploits are often discovered 
by other actors and reused broadly in a short 
period of time, leaving unpatched systems at 
risk. Even though zero\-day exploitation can be 
difficult to detect, actors’ post\-exploit actions are 
often easier to detect and, if coming from fully 
patched software, can act as a warning sign of 
a compromise.

Speed and scale of vulnerability commoditization 
On average, it takes only 14 days for an exploit to be available in the wild after a vulnerability is publicly disclosed. 
This view provides an analysis of the timelines of exploitation of zero\-day vulnerabilities, along with the number of 
systems vulnerable to the given exploit and active on the internet from the time of first public disclosure. 
While zero\-day vulnerability attacks 
tend to initially target a limited set of 
organizations, they are quickly adopted 
into the larger threat actor ecosystem. 
This kicks off a race for threat actors 
to exploit the vulnerability as widely as 
possible before their potential targets 
install patches. 
While we observe many nation state actors 
developing exploits from unknown vulnerabilities, 
China\-based nation state threat actors are 
particularly proficient at discovering and 
developing zero\-day exploits. China’s vulnerability 
reporting regulation went into effect September 
2021, marking a first in the world for a government 
to require the reporting of vulnerabilities into 
a government authority for review prior to the 
vulnerability being shared with the product or 
service owner. This new regulation might enable 
elements in the Chinese government to stockpile 
reported vulnerabilities toward weaponizing 
them. The increased use of zero days over the last 
year from China\-based actors likely reflects the 
first full year of China’s vulnerability disclosure 
requirements for the Chinese security community 
and a major step in the use of zero\-day exploits as 
a state priority. The vulnerabilities described below 
were first developed and deployed by China\-
based nation state actors in attacks, before being 
discovered and spread among other actors in the 
larger threat ecosystem.

Threats
Even organizations that 
are not a target of nation 
state attacks have a limited 
period to patch zero\-day 
vulnerabilities in impacted 
systems before they are 
exploited by the broader 
actor ecosystem.
These examples of newly identified vulnerabilities 
demonstrate that organizations have on average 
60 days from the time a vulnerability is patched 
and a proof of concept (POC) code is made 
available online, and often picked up by other 
actors for reuse. Similarly, organizations have 
on average 120 days before a vulnerability is 
available in automated vulnerability scanning 
and exploitation tools such as Metasploit—
which often result in the exploit being used 
on a massive scale. This highlights that even 
organizations that are not a target of nation state 
threat actors have a limited period to patch zero\-
day vulnerabilities in impacted systems before 
the vulnerabilities are exploited by the broader 
actor ecosystem.
CVE\-2021\-35211 SolarWinds Serv\-U
In July 2021, SolarWinds released a security 
advisory for CVE\-2021\-35211, crediting Microsoft 
with the notification. Note 8 At the time, we discovered 
nation state aligned threat actor DEV\-0322 
actively exploiting the SolarWinds Serv\-U 
vulnerability. Our RiskIQ team observed 12,646 IP 
addresses hosting internet connected versions of 
the impacted devices between June 15 and July 9\.
CVE\-2021\-40539 Zoho ManageEngine 
ADSelfService Plus
In September 2021, our researchers observed 
China\-affiliated actors exploiting Zoho 
ManageEngine at several US\-based entities. 
The vulnerability was publicly reported 
on September 6 as CVE\-2021\-40539 Zoho 
ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus, which 
organizations typically use to handle password 
resets. Note 9 DEV\-0322 exploited the vulnerability 
later in September, using it as an initial vector 
to gain a foothold in networks and performing 
additional actions including credential dumping, 
installing custom binaries, and dropping malware 
to maintain persistence. At the time of disclosure, 
RiskIQ observed 4,011 instances of these systems 
active and on the internet.
CVE\-2021\-44077 Zoho ManageEngine 
ServiceDesk Plus
In late October 2021, we observed DEV\-0322 
leveraging a vulnerability (CVE\-2021\-44077\) 
in a second Zoho ManageEngine product, 
ServiceDesk Plus—an IT help\-desk software 
with asset management. DEV\-0322 used 
this vulnerability to target and compromise 
entities in healthcare, information technology, 
higher education, and critical manufacturing 
sectors. On December 2, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a 
joint advisory warning to the public about nation 
state threat actors leveraging the vulnerability. 
At the time of disclosure, RiskIQ observed 
7,956 instances of these systems active and 
on the internet.
CVE\-2021\-42321 Microsoft Exchange

CVE\-2021\-42321 was revealed during the Tianfu 
Cup, an international cybersecurity summit and 
hacking competition held October 16 and 17, 
2021 in Chengdu, China. Security researchers at 
Microsoft observed the exploit for the Exchange 
vulnerability used in the wild on October 21, only 
three days after the vulnerability was revealed.

CVE\-2022\-26134 Confluence
A China\-affiliated actor likely had the zero\-day 
exploit code for the Confluence vulnerability 
(CVE\-2022\-26134\) four days before the 
vulnerability was publicly disclosed on June 2, 
and likely leveraged it against a US\-based entity.

instances of vulnerable Confluence systems on 
the internet.
Vulnerabilities are being picked up and 
exploited on a massive scale, and in 
increasingly shorter timeframes. 
Actionable insights
1 
Prioritize patching of zero\-day 
vulnerabilities as soon as they are 
released; don’t wait for the patch 
management cycle to deploy.
2 
Document and inventory all 
enterprise hardware and software 
assets to determine risk and to quickly 
determine when to act on patches.

 Russian state actors’ 
wartime cyber tactics 
threaten Ukraine 
and beyond 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This year saw Russian state actors launching 
cyber operations to complement military 
action during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, 
often using the same tactics and techniques 
deployed against targets outside of Ukraine. 
It is critical that organizations worldwide 
take measures to harden cybersecurity 
against digital threats stemming from 
Russia\-aligned threat actors.
The situation on the ground continues 
to fluctuate as the military conflict persists, 
and Ukraine and its allies should be prepared 
to defend themselves if Russian state cyber 
operators increase the frequency or intensity 
of intrusions in line with military objectives. 
During the first four months of the war, 
Microsoft observed threat actors associated 
with the Russian military launch multiple waves 
of destructive cyberattacks against nearly 50 
distinct Ukrainian agencies and enterprises 
and espionage\-focused intrusions against 
many others. Excluding operations against 
online services customers, 64 percent of 
Russian threat activity against known targets 
was directed at Ukraine\-based organizations 
between late February and June. 
In each operation, Russian threat actors 
employed many of the tactics, techniques, 
and procedures (TTPs) we observed being used 
before invasion against targets both within and 
outside of Ukraine. These actors intended to 
destroy data and put Ukrainian government 
agencies off balance in the initial period of the 
conflict. They have since sought to derail the 
transport of military and humanitarian assistance 
to Ukraine, disrupt public access to services and 
media, and steal information of longer\-term 
intelligence or economic value to Russia.
Targeting transportation threatens an area of 
critical importance to Ukrainian citizens trying 
to survive the conflict. According to a UNICEF\-
sponsored survey in May, respondents in 
conflict\-affected urban areas were most worried 
about transport and fuel, supply disruptions, 
security, and limited access to food, medical 
services, and financial services. Note 10 In June, the 
UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine said at least 
15\.7 million people in Ukraine were in urgent 
need of humanitarian assistance, and the 
number would grow as the war continues. Note 11
Outside of Ukraine, Microsoft detected 
Russian network intrusion efforts against 
128 organizations in 42 countries between 
late February and June. The United States was 
Russia’s number one target. Poland, through 
which much of the international military and 
humanitarian assistance to Ukraine transits, 
was also a significant target during this period. 
Threat actors affiliated with the Russian state 
pursued organizations in Baltic countries and 
computer networks in Denmark, Norway, Finland, 
and Sweden in April and May as well.

Federal, state, and local government organizations in Ukraine have remained priority targets for Russian state and 
state\-affiliated threat groups throughout the conflict. The focus on transportation, energy, financial, and media 
sector organizations highlight the risk that these cyber operations pose to services on which Ukrainian citizens rely.

We have seen an increase in similar 
activity targeting the foreign ministries of 
NATO countries.
Russian state threat groups remained interested 
in compromising critical infrastructure both 
within and outside of Ukraine this past year. 
IRIDIUM deployed the Industroyer2 malware in a 
failed effort to leave millions of people in Ukraine 
without power. Outside of Ukraine, BROMINE 
conducted intrusions against organizations 
involved in manufacturing, and industrial control 
systems in early 2022\.
Russian state and state\-affiliated actors directed 
cyber operations against Ukraine, its allies, and 
other targets of intelligence value this year using 
many of the following TTPs:
Spear phishing with malicious attachments 
or links
Russian state and Russia\-affiliated groups like 
ACTINIUM, NOBELIUM, STRONTIUM, DEV\-
0257, SEABORGIUM, and IRIDIUM all used 
phishing campaigns to gain initial access to 
desired accounts and networks in organizations 
within and outside Ukraine. Many campaigns 
utilized compromised or spoofed accounts 
at targeted organizations or within the same 
industry and compelling themes to lure victims. 
NOBELIUM used compromised diplomatic 
accounts to send phishing mail disguised as 
diplomatic communications to foreign ministry 
employees across the globe. STRONTIUM created 
spoof accounts based on publicly available 
names of account holders at think tanks in the 
United States and sent phishing messages to 
gain access to accounts at those think tanks. 
SEABORGIUM phished using lures related to 
reporting on the Ukraine conflict to gain initial 
access to accounts at international affairs think 
tanks in the Nordic countries.
Exploitation of IT services supply chain to 
impact downstream customers
In late 2021, Russian state actors compromised 
IT services providers and used the access 
to facilitate website defacements and the 
deployment of Whispergate destructive malware 
by DEV\-0586 in January. Note 12 DEV\-0586 also 
compromised the network of an IT firm that built 
resource management systems for Ukraine’s 
Ministry of Defense and other organizations in 
the communications and transportation sectors, 
indicating the group was exploring third\-party 
attack options in those sectors as well. 
Worldwide, but especially in the United States 
and Western Europe, NOBELIUM targeted IT 
services providers to gain access to government 
and other sensitive networks throughout 
2021–2022 (see the discussion of supply chain 
vulnerabilities earlier in this chapter).

Exploitation of public\-facing applications 
to gain initial access to networks 
 
Since at least late 2021, STRONTIUM worked 
to develop and refine its capabilities to exploit 
public\-facing services, such as Microsoft 
Exchange servers, to steal information. 
STRONTIUM exploited unpatched Exchange 
servers to access Ukrainian government accounts 
as well as military and defense industry\-related 
organizations in the United States, Lebanon, Peru, 
and Romania, and other government agencies 
based in Armenia, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Malaysia. 
DEV\-0586, also affiliated with the Russian military, 
exploited Confluence server vulnerabilities to 
gain initial access to government and IT sector 
organizations in Ukraine and other Eastern 
European countries. 
Russian state and affiliated threat 
actors use many of the same TTPs to 
compromise organizations of interest 
during times of war and peace.
Use of administrative accounts and protocols, 
and native utilities for network discovery and 
lateral movement 
After gaining initial access to a network, 
Microsoft observed Russian state actors 
leveraging legitimate accounts and software 
utilities used to perform basic maintenance 
tasks to evade detection for as long as 
possible. They relied on compromised 
identities with administrative capabilities and 
valid administration protocols, tools, and 
methods to move laterally within networks 
without immediately attracting the attention of 
automated monitors and network defenders.
Basic cyber hygiene and employment of endpoint 
detection and response tools can help mitigate 
the negative impact of these types of operations 
in peacetime as well as during times of war.
The unpredictability of the ongoing 
conflict demands that organizations 
worldwide take measures to harden 
cybersecurity against digital threats 
stemming from Russian state and 
Russia\-affiliated threat actors.
Actionable insights
1 Minimize credential theft and account 
abuse by protecting the identities 
of your users by implementing MFA 
identity protection tools and enforcing 
least privilege access to secure the 
most sensitive and privileged accounts 
and systems.
2 Apply updates to ensure all your systems 
get the highest level of protection as soon 
as possible and are kept up to date.
3 Deploy anti\-malware, endpoint detection, 
and identity protection solutions across 
your organization. A combination of 
defense\-in\-depth security solutions, paired 
with trained and capable personnel, can 
empower your organization to identify, 
detect, and prevent intrusions impacting 
your business. 
4 Enable investigations and recovery in the 
event you detect or receive notification of 
a threat to your environment by backing 
up critical systems and enabling logging. 
Establishing an incident response plan is 
strongly encouraged.

 China expanding 
global targeting for 
competitive advantage
 
 
 
 
 
In today’s complex geopolitical climate, 
Chinese state and state\-affiliated threat 
actors conducting cyber operations often 
aim to further the country’s strategic military, 
economic, and foreign relations goals as part 
of China’s objective to attain competitive 
advantage. In the last year, Microsoft 
has observed widespread Chinese threat 
activity targeting countries around the world.
Since mid\-2021, China has been maneuvering 
to ensure economic and financial stability amid 
the worst COVID\-19 surge in two years. Note 13 China 
continued to juggle their position on geopolitical 
events, such as the struggle to balance their 
“limitless” partnership with Russia, Note 14 and maintain 
their position on the world stage. Note 15 In addition, 
China’s stance against the United States and 
its allies over Taiwan Note 16 and the South China 
sea continued to strain foreign relations 
with many countries. Note 17 
Chinese state and state\-affiliated threat 
groups increased targeting of smaller 
nations around the globe with a focus 
on Southeast Asia to gain competitive 
advantage on all fronts.
Countries targeted by Chinese state 
and state\-affiliated groups
China also continued expanding its economic 
influence globally through previously established 
Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI), attempting to 
revive a comprehensive investment framework 
with the EU, Note 18 and negotiating a new regional 
trade agreement with 15 countries in Asia 
Pacific known as the Regional Comprehensive 
Economic Partnership. Note 19 Microsoft assesses China 
will continue to utilize cyber collection as a tool 
to help advance its strategic political, military, 
and economic goals due to observed cyber 
operations and the breadth of entities targeted.
Cyber targeting likely to advance economic 
and military interests.
Microsoft observed widespread targeting of 
smaller nations around the world by Chinese 
state and state\-affiliated threat groups, 
suggesting China is likely using cyberespionage 
as a component of its global economic and 
military influence.

Think tanks/NGOs, media, IT, government, and education sectors were among the most targeted sectors 
for China\-based threat groups, probably for persistent intelligence collection and reconnaissance.
The span of targets included, but were not 
limited to, countries in Africa, the Caribbean, 
the Middle East, Oceania, and South Asia, with a 
particular focus on those countries in Southeast 
Asia, and the Pacific Islands.
In line with China’s BRI strategy, China\-based 
threat groups targeted entities in Afghanistan, 
Kazakhstan, Mauritius, Namibia, and Trinidad and 
Tobago. Note 20 For example, Trinidad and Tobago was 
the first Caribbean country to endorse China’s 
BRI strategy in 2018, and China considers it an 
important partner in the region. NICKEL has 
had persistent network operations targeting 
Trinidad and Tobago since 2021\. For instance, in 
March 2022, NICKEL conducted reconnaissance 
activities targeting a government agency, likely 
for intelligence collection purposes.

Meanwhile, Microsoft observed Chinese state 
and state\-affiliated threat groups focusing their 
network operations against entities in Southeast 
Asia and expanding to Pacific Island countries as 
China shifted its military and economic priorities 
to cope with the challenges of the United States’ 
renewed interest in the region. In January 2022, 
Microsoft observed RADIUM targeting an energy 
company and an energy\-associated government 
agency in Vietnam, and an Indonesian 
government agency. RADIUM’s activities likely 
aligned with China’s strategic goals in the South 
China Sea. Note 21 In late February and early March, 
GALLIUM compromised more than 100 accounts 
affiliated with a prominent intergovernmental 
organization (IGO) in the Southeast Asia region. 
The timing of GALLIUM’s targeting of the IGO in 
the region coincided with the announcement of 
a scheduled meeting between the United States 
and regional leaders. GALLIUM actors were likely 
tasked to monitor communications and collect 
intelligence before the event.
As China expanded its influence in Pacific Island 
countries, Chinese threat groups’ activities 
followed. In April, China and the Solomon 
Islands signed a security agreement intended to 
“promote peace and security.” The agreement 
potentially allows China to deploy armed police 
and military to the Solomon Islands. Note 22 In May, 
China hosted the second China\-Pacific Island 
Countries (PICs) Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in 
Fiji and proposed to advance a “comprehensive 
strategic partnership” to further political, cultural, 
social, security, and climate change interests and 
also to fight the pandemic. Note 23 Around the same 
time in May, Microsoft identified GADOLINIUM’s 
malware on Solomon Islands government 
systems. RADIUM also ran malicious code on 
systems of a telecommunications company in 
Papua New Guinea. We assess these activities 
were likely for intelligence collection purposes 
to support China’s overall regional strategy.
Microsoft disrupts NICKEL operations, but the 
threat group shows its persistence.
In December 2021, the Microsoft Digital Crimes 
Unit (DCU) filed pleadings with the US District 
Court for the Eastern District of Virginia seeking 
authority to seize 42 command and control (C2\) 
domains controlled by NICKEL. These C2 domains 
were used in operations against governments, 
diplomatic entities, and NGOs across Central and 
South America, the Caribbean, Europe, and North 
America since September 2019\. Note 24 Through these 
operations, NICKEL achieved long\-term access to 
several entities and consistently exfiltrated data 
from some victims since late 2019\.
As China continues to establish bilateral 
economic relations with more countries—
often in agreements associated with BRI—
China’s global influence will continue to grow. 
We assess Chinese state and state\-affiliated 
threat actors will pursue targets in their 
government, diplomatic, and NGO sectors to 
gain new insights, likely in pursuit of economic 
espionage or traditional intelligence collection 
objectives. Since Microsoft’s disruption, NICKEL 
has targeted several government agencies, 
likely trying to regain lost access. Between late 
March and May 2022, NICKEL re\-compromised 
at least five government agencies across the 
globe. This suggests the group had additional 
entry points to those entities or regained access 
through new C2 domains. NICKEL’s persistence in 
repeatedly compromising the same government 
agencies globally indicates the importance of the 
task at a high level.
China is being more assertive 
with their stance on foreign policy. 
We assess cyber\-enabled economic 
espionage and intelligence collection 
will likely continue.
Actionable insights
1
 
 
Boost cyber defense to mitigate cyber 
threats proactively. The persistence 
of Chinese threat actors requires 
organizations to identify, protect, detect, 
and respond possible intrusions in a 
timely fashion.

Threat actors abuse scheduled tasks Note 25 as 
a common method of persistence and 
defense evasion, ensure your environment 
employs additional security guidelines 
to protect against this commonly used 
technique. Note 26

 Iran growing 
increasingly 
aggressive following 
power transition 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Microsoft has observed Iranian state 
groups and affiliated actors increase the 
pace and scope of cyberattacks against 
Israel, expand ransomware attacks 
beyond regional adversaries to US and EU 
victims, and target high profile US critical 
infrastructure to at least pre\-position for 
potential destructive cyberattacks.
Iranian state actors’ growing cyber aggression 
has followed a transition of its presidential 
power. In the summer of 2021, hardline President 
Ibrahim Raisi replaced moderate President 
Hassan Rouhani. In sharp contrast to Raisi, who 
is a protégé of the Supreme Leader and a close 
ally of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps 
(IRGC), former President Rouhani’s penchant 
for diplomacy often brought him at odds with 
the Supreme Leader and IRGC senior leaders. Note 29 
The hawkish views of the Raisi administration 
appear to have raised the willingness of Iranian 
actors to take bolder action against Israel and the 
West, particularly the United States, despite the 
resumption of diplomatic engagement to revive 
the nuclear deal with Iran.
Increased pace and scope of Iranian 
cyberattacks against Israel
Within weeks of Raisi completing the formation 
of his foreign policy team, Note 30 Iranian state actors 
resumed destructive cyberattacks against 
Israel at a faster pace than the prior year. 
These ransomware and hack\-and\-leak attacks 
were conducted every few weeks beginning 
in September and involved at least three Iran\-
affiliated actors, suggesting the attacks might 
have been part of a nationwide campaign of 
retaliation against Israel. In at least one case, 
Microsoft assessed a ransomware attack 
against an Israeli organization in late 2021 was 
meant to conceal an underlying data deletion 
attack. Microsoft malware analysis determined 
the ransomware delivered to the victim was 
programmed to execute wiper malware 
following encryption.
By 2022, Iranian cyberattacks escalated in target 
selection and form of attacks. In February, 
DEV\-0198 attempted to conduct a destructive 
attack against Israeli critical infrastructure. 
Microsoft also assesses an Iran\-affiliated actor 
was most likely responsible for a sophisticated 
cyberattack that set off emergency rocket sirens 
in Israel in June probably by using software that 
adjusts audio over IP networks.
Iranian threat to US and Israeli critical 
infrastructure mounted throughout the year 
Iranian state actors Microsoft assesses are 
affiliated with the IRGC (PHOSPHORUS and 
DEV\-0198\) targeted high\-profile US and Israeli 
critical infrastructure from late 2021 to mid\-2022\. 
The likely aim was to provide Tehran with options 
to retaliate against the same sectors that senior 
IRGC officials blamed the United States and Israel 
for disrupting in Iran. Note 31 We assess this activity is 
tied to statements in late October 2021 by IRGC 
General Gholamreza Jalali, head of Iran’s Passive 
Defense Organization, who echoed accusations 
from other influential figures within the regime 
that the United States and Israel conducted 
cyberattacks on Iran’s ports, railways, and fueling 
stations. Note 32 Jalali delivered this accusation a 
second time in prepared remarks during a staged 
Friday prayer speech at a podium with the image 
of a missile striking the words “USA,” suggesting 
his seniors held the same view. Note 33
PHOSPHORUS began widespread scanning 
of US organizations in October 2021 for 
unpatched Fortinet and ProxyShell vulnerabilities. 
Once compromised, these unpatched systems 
were used to execute ransomware attacks, in 
several cases against critical infrastructure in 
the United States and other Western nations. 
These marked the first confirmed cases of Iranian 
state affiliated ransomware attacks outside the 
Middle East. Following the cyberattack against 
Iran’s fueling stations in late October, Microsoft 
observed a spike in Iranian ransomware 
attacks against US companies, suggesting 
possible correlation.
At the same time, PHOSPHORUS moved into 
directed targeting, often via spear phishing, of 
high\-profile US critical infrastructure companies 
including major seaports and airports of entry, 
transit systems, utility companies, and oil and 
gas companies. This targeting, often conducted 
via spear phishing, lasted until mid\-2022\. 
The targets directly align with the sectors Tehran 
has blamed the United States and Israel for 
attacking in Iran, and likely provided Iran with 
options for retaliation. The compromise of near 
identical targets would provide an opportunity 
to deter such future attacks, while seeking to 
avoid escalation by signaling the cause of attacks 
without admitting guilt.

In Israel, DEV\-0198 targeted Israeli railways, 
logistics companies, software providers of 
logistics companies, and fuel companies with a 
focus on gas stations. In early 2022, the group 
conducted a disruptive attack on the network 
of a major Israeli logistics company, which 
forced the company to shut down its computers 
and some of its operations to contain the 
attack. In another case, we observed the group 
attempt to access the network of a major Israeli 
transportation provider via stolen or reused 
credentials. Meanwhile, another Iranian actor, 
DEV\-0343—whose targeting of defense, maritime 
transportation, and satellite imagery companies 
suggests links to the IRGC—compromised 
accounts at Israeli transportation and port\-
related entities throughout early 2021\.
Iranian threat groups are likely to remain a threat 
to US and Israeli transportation and energy 
companies, particularly as diplomatic efforts 
to revive the Iranian nuclear deal wane and 
Washington, Tel Aviv, and Tehran seek alternative 
coercive means to lever concessions.

Lebanon\-based group with links 
to Iran targeting Israel 
Microsoft monitors cyber threat activities 
regardless of platform, targeted victim, or 
geographical region. We maintain visibility 
and active threat hunting worldwide to 
write better detections for our customers.
Although threats from Russia, China, Iran, and 
North Korea represent the majority of our 
observed nation state actor activity, we also track 
and communicate about threats from NATO 
member countries and democratic nations. 
Last year, we featured activity by a Turkey\-based 
actor (SILICON) and a Vietnam\-based actor 
(BISMUTH). This year, we are expanding on 
the details of a Lebanon\-based group that we 
previously disclosed publicly. Note 36
Microsoft uncovered a previously undocumented 
Lebanon\-based group that we assess 
with moderate confidence operated in 
coordination with actors affiliated with Iran’s 
Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). 
Such collaboration or direction from Tehran 
would align with revelations since late 2020 that 
the Government of Iran is using third parties to 
carry out cyber operations, likely to enhance 
Iran’s plausible deniability.
In the observed activity, POLONIUM targeted 
or compromised two dozen Israel\-based 
organizations and one IGO with operations 
in Lebanon between February and May 2022, 
before Microsoft disrupted and publicly revealed 
 
 
 
 
its activity. Nearly half the Israeli organizations 
were part of Israel’s defense industry or had 
links to Israeli defense companies, indicating 
the group has a similar set of interests as Iran 
in collecting intelligence on and/or directly 
countering Israel. Note 37
POLONIUM’s assessed links to MOIS groups 
are based on observed victim overlaps and 
commonality of tools and techniques.

 Note 39
POLONIUM deployed a series of custom 
implants using cloud services for C2 and data 
exfiltration—notably OneDrive and DropBox. 
POLONIUM often created unique OneDrive 
applications for targets, likely to evade detection. 
As of June 2022, Microsoft suspended more than 
20 POLONIUM\-created OneDrive applications, 
notified affected organizations, and deployed 
a series of security intelligence updates to 
quarantine POLONIUM\-developed tools. 
Microsoft 
successfully 
detected and 
disabled POLONIUM’s 
abuse of OneDrive 
as a C2\.

 North Korean cyber 
capabilities employed 
to achieve regime’s 
three main goals 
 
 
 
 
 
 
North Korea’s cyber priorities over the past 
year reflected the government’s stated 
global priorities. Kim Jong Un emphasized 
the three priorities of building defense 
capacity, bolstering the country’s struggling 
economy, and ensuring domestic stability 
in several key addresses. Note 43 The actions taken 
by North Korean state actors clearly show 
that cyber is being utilized to achieve these 
three goals.
North Korean 
state actors used a 
variety of tactics to 
attempt to penetrate 
aerospace companies 
around the globe. 
North Korean state threat groups, primarily 
CERIUM and ZINC, used a variety of tactics to 
attempt to penetrate networks of defense and 
aerospace companies around the globe. As North 
Korea embarked on its most aggressive period of 
missile testing ever in the first half of 2022, it used 
cyberespionage to help North Korean researchers 
gain an edge in developing indigenous defense 
systems and countermeasures for the advances 
its adversaries made.
We observed COPERNICIUM targeting a variety 
of cryptocurrency\-related companies around the 
world, often with success, to help support North 
Korea’s struggling economy. While we cannot 
confirm whether the group was able to exfiltrate 
money after a compromise, we observed 
COPERNICIUM infect dozens of machines by 
sending malicious documents masquerading as 
proposals from other cryptocurrency companies.
Finally, a group Microsoft tracks as DEV\-0215 
worked to uphold stability and loyalty in North 
Korea by targeting news organizations that 
report on North Korean issues. These outlets 
have sources both in North Korea and within 
communities of defectors, which Pyongyang 
views as an existential threat. In addition, the 
group worked to gain access to networks of 
Korean\-speaking Christian groups, which tend 
to be outspoken against North Korea and work 
actively with North Korean defectors.
Targeting of defense and aerospace companies
North Korean state actors led by CERIUM and 
ZINC put significant effort into developing tactics 
aimed at penetrating defense and aerospace 
companies. CERIUM repeatedly probed South 
Korean virtual private networks (VPNs) by 
downloading clients and looking for weaknesses. 
It also downloaded common applications used 
by South Korean military and government clients, 
likely looking for vulnerabilities. The group 
closely followed current events and wrote new 
lure documents which used high profile topics 
as bait to encourage targets to click on their 
malware executables and links.
Both ZINC and CERIUM used social media and 
social engineering in campaigns. ZINC was 
particularly adept at creating fake profiles on 
LinkedIn and other professional social media 
sites, where its operators posed as recruiters 
for major defense and aerospace companies. 
Using these profiles, they sent links or malicious 
file attachments to potential victims using direct 
messages on social media or email.
In addition to employees of corporations, 
CERIUM also broadly targeted members of the 
South Korean military, showing special interest 
in both South Korean military academies and 
military members working in academia.
Targeting cryptocurrency to balance losses
Since UN sanctions were levied in 2016, North 
Korea’s economy has continued to contract, 
compounded by natural disasters such as floods Note 44 
and drought Note 45 as well as a near\-total lockdown 
of borders to imports since the onset of the 
COVID\-19 pandemic in early 2020\. Note 46 Although 
North Korea opened its borders for trade with 
China briefly in early 2022, they were soon closed 
again. Note 47 In mid\-May, North Korea reported its 
first domestic case of COVID\-19\. Note 48 It has since 
applied a China\-style “zero COVID” strategy 
of mass lockdowns to combat the virus which 
has negatively impacted North Korea’s already 
fragile economy.
The North Korean state group COPERNICIUM 
tried to offset some of the lost revenue by 
stealing money—typically in the form of 
cryptocurrency—from any company whose 
networks it could penetrate. We saw dozens 
of machines compromised belonging to 
cryptocurrency\-related companies in the United 
States, Canada, Europe, and throughout Asia. 
COPERNICIUM even compromised machines 
belonging to cryptocurrency\-related companies 
within North Korea’s strongest ally, China, both 
on the mainland and in Hong Kong. The group 
relied heavily on social media for its early 
reconnaissance and approaches to targets. 
Actors would build profiles pretending to be 
developers or senior officers in businesses 
related to cryptocurrency. They would then 
establish relationships with those in the industry, 
sending malicious links or files once they had 
built up rapport.

A group related to PLUTONIUM develops 
and deploys ransomware
 
A group of actors originating from North 
Korea that Microsoft tracks as DEV\-0530 began 
developing and using ransomware in attacks 
in June 2021\. This group, which called itself 
H0lyGh0st, utilized a ransomware payload with 
the same name for its campaigns and successfully 
compromised small businesses in multiple 
countries as early as September 2021\.
Microsoft assessed that DEV\-0530 had 
connections with another North Korean\-based 
group tracked as PLUTONIUM (also known 
as DarkSeoul or Andariel). While the use of 
H0lyGh0st ransomware in campaigns is unique 
to DEV\-0530, MSTIC observed communications 
between the two groups, as well as DEV\-0530 
using tools created exclusively by PLUTONIUM.
It is not certain that DEV\-0530 activity was 
government\-sponsored. Although ransomware 
attacks could have been ordered by the 
government for the same reason it sponsors 
theft from cryptocurrency companies, it is 
also possible the actors behind DEV\-0530 
were acting independently to earn money for 
themselves. If it were North Korean hackers 
operating independently, that would explain why 
the activity was not widespread compared to 
government\-sponsored theft operations against 
cryptocurrency companies.
Targeting North Korean news outlets, 
defectors, religious groups, and 
aid organizations
In the last year, Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un 
was publicly more focused on internal security 
and loyalty than missiles and nuclear weapons. 
Reflecting this preoccupation with domestic 
issues, at least two North Korean state groups 
focused on aspects the regime would view as 
domestic threats.
The first was a group Microsoft tracks as DEV\-
0215, which targets media organizations that 
closely follow North Korean news. One likely 
reason for this targeting is these media outlets 
obtain their news from North Korean defectors, 
Chinese citizens who work closely with North 
Korea, and even some North Korean citizens 
based inside the country, using a variety of 
methods to communicate with the outside world. 
The North Korean government views these 
groups as an existential threat to its survival, 
particularly citizens inside North Korea who 
would be viewed as traitors and spies. DEV\-0215 
likely sought to identify these outlets’ sources so 
they could neutralize potential information leaks.

Microsoft also saw evidence of DEV\-
0215 targeting Korean\-speaking Christian 
communities. Evangelical Christian Korean 
churches tend to be critical of both North Korea 
and South Korean governments that favor 
engagement with North Korea. These churches 
are likely to conduct outreach to defectors, and 
some engage in humanitarian work with North 
Korea. North Korea views them as a threat 
because, while the stream of defectors coming 
from North Korea almost dried up during the 
pandemic, Note 49 these Christian groups often play 
a critical role in helping defectors escape. 
DEV\-0215 has generated fake documents about 
Christian conferences for Korean speakers as 
lures to target the group and discover who is 
helping organize defections. 
Finally, state group OSMIUM showed steady 
interest in international aid organizations 
throughout the year, including organizations 
that have assisted North Korea in the past. 
While North Korea has generally shunned offers 
of help from outside the country, especially since 
the outbreak of COVID\-19, Note 50 it is possible that 
North Korea is considering taking up offers of 
help, but is wary of the security ramifications of 
allowing foreign aid workers into the country. 
North Korea may be penetrating the networks 
of aid organizations worldwide to determine 
whether to allow such aid into their own country.
Actionable insights
1
 
North Korean state actors are skilled, 
relentless, and creative, but organizations 
can defend against them. 
2 
Most successful attacks can be stopped 
with basic cyber hygiene, such as two 
factor authentication or not opening 
attachments from unknown individuals 
in a virtual environment.

Among North Korea experts, there has 
long been debate over whether the 
North Korean government is in earnest 
with its public statements or whether it 
is posturing for effect. The alignment 
of cyberattacks with North Korea’s 
announced priorities validates the belief 
that North Korea means what it says 
when it speaks publicly about its goals.

 Cyber mercenaries 
threaten the stability 
of cyberspace 
 
 
 
 
There is a growing industry of private 
companies that develop and sell tools, 
techniques, and services that enable their 
clients—often governments—to break into 
networks, computers, phones, and internet\-
connected devices. An asset for nation 
state actors, these entities often endanger 
dissidents, human rights defenders, 
journalists, civil society advocates, and 
other private citizens. We refer to these 
as cyber mercenaries or private sector 
offensive actors. 
A world where private sector companies create 
and sell cyberweapons is more dangerous 
for consumers, businesses of all sizes, and 
governments. These offensive tools can be used 
in ways that are inconsistent with the norms 
and values of good governance and democracy. 
Microsoft believes the protection of human rights 
is a fundamental obligation, and one we take 
seriously by curtailing “surveillance as a service” 
across the globe. 
Microsoft has assessed certain state actors 
across democratic and authoritarian regimes 
outsource the development or use of 
“surveillance as a service” technology. This is 
how they avoid accountability and oversight, 
as well as acquire capabilities that would be 
difficult to develop natively. 
These cyberweapons provide nation 
states with surveillance capabilities 
they would not have been able to 
develop alone.
The market in which cyber mercenaries operate 
is opaque. Nevertheless, we continue to observe 
these groups using zero\-day exploits and 
even zero\-click exploits that require no victim 
interaction at all, enabling surveillance as a service. 
Microsoft recently announced a European private 
sector offensive actor we call KNOTWEED, an 
Austria\-based PSOA called DSIRF. Multiple news 
reports have linked the company to the 
development and attempted sale of a malware 
toolset called Subzero. Note 51 Victims include law firms, 
banks, and strategic consultancies in countries 
such as Austria, the UK, and Panama. Note 52 
Because these offensive surveillance capabilities 
are no longer highly classified capabilities created 
by defense and intelligence agencies, but rather 
commercial products now offered to companies 
and individuals, any regulatory regime for 
cyberweapons needs to move beyond export 
control. The impact of these cyberweapons can 
be devastating. 
When a cyber mercenary exploits a 
vulnerability in a product or service, they 
put the entire computing ecosystem at risk. 
When vulnerabilities are identified publicly, 
companies are in a race against time to 
release protections before broad based 
attacks ensue (see our earlier discussion of 
vulnerability exploits). This is a dangerous 
and difficult cycle for both software suppliers 
(who must expediently develop patches) and 
consumers of products (who must implement 
the patches immediately). 
As a founding member of the Cybersecurity 
Tech Accord Note 53—a leading alliance bringing 
together more than 150 technology companies—
Microsoft has made a commitment not to 
engage in offensive operations online. We stand 
by that commitment and by our human rights 
responsibilities in this area. We have engaged 
in technical disruptions and legal challenges to 
highlight the negative impacts caused by the 
services provided by cyber mercenaries and 
will continue to protect our customers when 
we see abuse.
Cyber mercenaries create and provide 
“surveillance as a service” capabilities 
that are technologically sophisticated 
and broadly available, including 
advanced malware, and a range 
of techniques.
Actionable insights for governments
1
 
Implement transparency and oversight 
requirements for surveillance as a service, 
particularly in procurement, including 
the banning of these offensive actors, 
as the US has done with the Department 
of Commerce listing of companies on the 
Entity List. 
2
 
Establish post\-employment restrictions 
for former employees in this sector.
 
3
 
Aim to implement “know your customer” 
obligations and encourage companies to 
uphold their human rights commitments.

 Operationalizing 
cybersecurity norms 
for peace and security 
in cyberspace 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We urgently need a consistent, global 
framework that prioritizes human rights 
and protects people from reckless state 
behavior online. Nowhere is this more 
clearly demonstrated than in the ongoing 
war in Ukraine. In addition to a global 
strategic effort, governments can act now 
to have an immediate positive impact.
Five years ago, Microsoft called for a “Digital 
Geneva Convention” to advance responsibilities 
and obligations across sectors to defend peace 
and security online. Cyberspace was emerging 
as a distinct and volatile domain of conflict 
and competition between states, with attacks 
becoming more common, even in times of peace.
Today, there is still a clear need for such a 
framework—evidenced by Russian cyberattacks 
against Ukraine as part of Russia’s invasion. This war 
has created a new front line that is dramatically 
different from any we have known before.
Bringing stability to cyberspace will require 
strengthening and reimagining global 
governance institutions to make them fit\-for\-
purpose. Cyberspace is fundamentally different 
from other domains—it is borderless, synthetic, 
and maintained largely by private industry. 
This means asking the technology industry to 
take greater responsibility for both the security 
of products and services and the wider digital 
ecosystem. While there has been notable 
progress on all fronts, the challenges have 
grown dramatically.
We must redouble collective efforts to defend 
the security of cyberspace. We cannot take the 
rights and freedoms we have come to expect 
online for granted. While we struggle to address 
the challenges, malicious actors are planning 
how and where to strike next using AI, leveraging 
disinformation, and finding ways to undermine 
the fledgling metaverse. Human rights defenders, 
the technology industry, and rights\-respecting 
governments must work together towards an 
affirmative vision for a safe and secure online 
world. The road ahead is long, but there are 
things governments can do now to immediately 
improve the cybersecurity ecosystem:
• Cite norms, laws, and consequences in 
attributions. One major improvement over 
the past five years has been the speed and 
coordination of government attributions of 
cyberattacks. Beyond simply naming and 
shaming, these statements need to highlight 
which international laws or norms are violated 
and what manner of consequences will be 
imposed to help strengthen recognition of 
international expectations.
• Clarify international law interpretation online. 
While governments agree that international 
law applies online, questions remain about 
how it applies in specific instances. This is 
particularly pertinent in the aftermath of the 
Ukraine invasion. Governments can go a long 
way toward setting expectations, avoiding 
misunderstandings, and building trust by 
stating how they understand their obligations 
under international law.
• Consult with other stakeholders. 
As international forums continue to 
discover the best ways to facilitate robust 
multistakeholder inclusion, governments can 
support informed dialogue by consulting 
with multistakeholder communities, in 
particular the technology industry, to 
ensure dialog benefits from those with 
indispensable expertise.
• Form a standing body to support responsible 
state behavior in cyberspace. The work of 
international diplomatic forums to advance 
responsible state behavior online has never 
been more important. There is a clear need 
for a permanent UN mechanism to deal with 
cyberspace as a domain of conflict.
• Define new norms for evolving threats. 
Cyberspace threats are constantly evolving 
alongside innovations in technology. 
While international norms should be 
technology neutral, they will need to be 
updated and attenuated based on changes 
in the threat landscape and how we use 
technology. Even today, we see gaps in the 
existing international framework being abused. 
States should commit to expressly protect core 
processes underpinning the digital ecosystem 
that are not currently protected, like the software 
update process. Moreover, specific areas 
deserve additional protections. For example, 
as we have learned amid the pandemic, norms 
for protecting healthcare are essential.
 
 
Nation state actors and attacks are 
increasing in volume and sophistication, 
creating a situation that is untenable.
Immediate action is imperative—there 
are things governments can do now to 
immediately improve the cybersecurity 
ecosystem, including implementing agreed 
upon norms and rules for state behavior in 
cyberspace and working with the broader 
multistakeholder community to address 
emerging gaps.
Multilateral institutions must be 
reimagined to address the pressing 
challenge of nation state cyberattacks.

 Introduction 
Accelerating digital 
transformation has increased 
the cybersecurity risk to 
critical infrastructure and 
cyber\-physical systems.
The last several years have seen unprecedented 
change in the digital world. Organizations are 
evolving to harness advances in computing 
capability from both the intelligent cloud and 
the intelligent edge. As a result of the pandemic 
forcing entities to digitize to survive and the 
rate at which industries worldwide are adopting 
internet\-facing devices, the attack surface of the 
digital world is increasing exponentially.
This rapid migration has outpaced the security 
community’s ability to keep up. Over the past 
year, we have observed threats exploiting devices 
in every part of the organization, from traditional 
IT equipment to operational technology (OT) 
controllers or simple Internet of Things (IoT) 
sensors. Although security of IT equipment has 
strengthened in recent years, IoT and OT device 
security has not kept pace. Threat actors are 
exploiting these devices to establish access on 
networks and enable lateral movement or disrupt 
the organization’s OT operations. We have seen 
attacks on power grids, ransomware attacks 
disrupting OT operations, IoT routers being 
leveraged for increased persistency, and attacks 
targeting vulnerabilities in firmware.
While the prevalence of IoT and OT vulnerabilities 
is a challenge for all organizations, critical 
infrastructure is at increased risk because threat 
actors have learned that disabling critical services 
is a powerful lever. The 2021 ransomware attack 
on the Colonial Pipeline Company demonstrated 
how criminals can disrupt a critical service to 
increase the likelihood of a ransom payment. 
And Russia’s cyberattacks against Ukraine 
demonstrate that some nation states view 
cyberattacks against critical infrastructure 
as acceptable sabotage to achieve its 
military objectives.
However, there is hope on the horizon. 
Policymakers and network defenders are 
acting to improve the cybersecurity of critical 
infrastructure, including the IoT and OT devices 
they rely on. Policymakers are accelerating the 
development of laws and regulations to build 
public trust in the cyber security of critical 
infrastructure and devices. 
Microsoft is partnering with governments around 
the world to seize this opportunity to enhance 
cybersecurity and we welcome additional 
engagement. We are, however, concerned that 
inconsistent, bespoke, or complex requirements 
could have unintended effects, including 
decreasing security in some cases by diverting 
scarce security resources toward compliance with 
multiple duplicative certifications.
From a security operation standpoint network 
defenders take multiple approaches to improving 
their organization’s IoT/OT security posture. 
One approach is to implement continuous 
monitoring of IoT and OT devices. Another is to 
“shift\-left”—meaning to demand and implement 
better cybersecurity practices for the IoT and 
OT devices themselves. A third approach is to 
implement a security monitoring solution which 
spans both IT and OT networks. This holistic 
approach has the significant added benefit of 
contributing to critical organizational processes, 
such as “breaking the silos” between OT and IT, 
which in turn enables the organization to reach 
an enhanced security posture while meeting 
business objectives.

Governments worldwide are developing 
and evolving policies to manage critical 
infrastructure cybersecurity risk. Many are 
also enacting policies to improve IoT and 
OT device security. The growing global 
wave of policy initiatives is creating 
enormous opportunity to enhance 
cybersecurity but also poses challenges 
to stakeholders across the ecosystem.
Developing a holistic vision for managing critical 
infrastructure cyber risk is critical, but complex, 
especially given the degree of interconnection across 
technologies and global suppliers, the range of 
technology uses and associated risks, and the need 
to invest in both short\-and long\-term strategies. 
Effectively scoped policies that drive iterative 
learning and improvements, and support global, 
cross\-sector interoperability, can help manage 
complexity and enable a more security\-minded 
digital transformation. However, a fragmented 
approach to legislation could lead to overlapping 
and inconsistent regulatory requirements. This could 
impact resources and ultimately undermine security 
objectives. For example, organizations could 
divert resources from innovation and security to 
formalistic compliance exercises.
Microsoft seeks to partner with governments 
around the world in pursuing effective critical 
infrastructure cybersecurity policies, increasing 
understanding of challenges and opportunities, 
and supporting efforts to enhance collective 
risk posture.
Policy developments in critical infrastructure 
cybersecurity risk management
During the last year, multiple jurisdictions 
including Australia, Chile, the European Union 
(EU), Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom (UK), 
and the United States, have developed, updated, 
or implemented cross\-sector or sector\-specific 
cybersecurity requirements. Note 1 Many of these 
governments—and others such as India Note 2 and 
Switzerland Note 3—already issued or are developing 
cybersecurity incident reporting requirements 
for critical infrastructure and essential service 
providers. Note 4
Some notable policy developments occurred in 
Australia, the EU, Indonesia, and the United States 
during the last year. Australia enacted two laws to 
help it manage cross\-sector critical infrastructure 
cybersecurity risks. The laws, among other things, 
designate new critical infrastructure sectors, 
require the development of risk management 
plans, mandate cybersecurity incident reporting, 
and empower the government to intervene if it 
determines a critical infrastructure operator is 
unwilling or unable to adequately respond to 
an incident.

The EU worked to update its NIS Directive 
of 2016, which provides a framework for EU 
member states to regulate technology services 
and products deemed critical to their economy 
and the functioning of society. The proposed 
NIS 2 includes revisions that would create a 
new category of critical digital infrastructure, 
increase requirements for cyber incident 
reporting, and impose additional cybersecurity 
risk management requirements, The EU also 
developed a proposed update to its Digital 
Operational Resilience Act (DORA), creating new 
requirements for information communication 
technologies used in the financial services sector.
In May, Indonesia issued a presidential 
regulation on the protection of vital information 
infrastructure (“IIV”), which will take effect in 
May 2024 and cover sectors such as energy, 
transportation, finance, and health, among 
others. Indonesia’s objective with the regulation 
is to protect the continuity of the implementation 
of IIV, prevent cyberattacks, and increase 
preparedness in handling cyber incidents. 
IIV providers will be responsible for conducting 
secure and reliable protection, implementing 
effective cyber risk management, and reporting 
cyber risk results to corresponding government 
agencies. The regulation includes a requirement 
to report cyber incidents within 24 hours.

The US Congress passed a law that authorized 
the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA) to issue regulations 
to require cyber incident reporting from 
critical infrastructure operators, and the US 
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) 
issued new sector\-specific cybersecurity 
requirements in the transportation sector. 
In 2021, TSA issued two security directives 
to hazardous liquid and natural gas pipeline 
operators in response to the ransomware 
attack on the Colonial Pipeline Company:
• The first directive required operators to 
designate a cybersecurity coordinator, report 
cyber incidents within 12 hours, and conduct 
a vulnerability assessment of their systems.
• The second directive, which TSA revised in 
2022, required them to implement specific 
mitigation measures to protect against 
ransomware attacks and other known threats 
to IT and OT systems, develop and implement 
a cybersecurity contingency and response 
plan within 30 days, and undergo an annual 
cybersecurity architecture design review.
Building on its regulations for pipelines, TSA issued 
two additional security directives later in 2021 that 
promulgated cybersecurity requirements to freight 
rail, passenger railroad carrier, or rail transit systems. 
The directives required that covered operators 
designate a cybersecurity coordinator, report 
cybersecurity incidents within 24 hours, develop 
and implement a cybersecurity incident response 
plan, and complete a cybersecurity vulnerability 
assessment. TSA simultaneously announced it also 
updated its aviation security programs to require 
airport and airline operators to implement the first 
two provisions, designating a coordinator and 
reporting incidents within 24 hours. 
Policy developments in IoT 
and OT device security
Across dozens of countries, governments are 
active in developing requirements to advance the 
cybersecurity of information and communications 
technology (ICT) products and services, including 
IoT and OT devices. In the context of ICT products 
and services, the biggest concerns are software 
supply chain security and IoT security.
• The European Commission proposed the 
Cyber Resilience Act, which would establish 
cybersecurity requirements for standalone 
software and connected devices and ancillary 
services. Note 5 Relevant practices for software 
vendors include leveraging a secure software 
development lifecycle Note 6 and providing a 
Software Bill of Materials. Note 7 New security 
requirements would apply to connected 
devices and all manufacturers would be tasked 
with managing coordinated vulnerability 
disclosure Note 8 processes for released products.
Policymakers have also focused their attention 
on the continued proliferation of IoT devices 
and networked OT devices.
• In the UK, the draft Product Security and 
Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill 
will require manufacturers of consumer 
connectable products, such as smart TVs, 
to stop using default passwords that are an 
easy target for cyber criminals, to establish a 
vulnerability disclosure policy (such as a way to 
receive notice of security flaws), and to provide 
transparency about the minimum length of 
time during which they will provide security 
updates. Note 9
• In the EU, new security standards or 
requirements are being implemented via 
multiple legislative instruments, including 
a delegated act to the Radio Equipment 
Directive that applies to wireless devices 
and seeks to improve network resilience, 
protect consumers’ privacy, and reduce the 
risk of monetary fraud. Note 10 In addition, use 
of a cloud certification scheme, Note 11 currently 
in development as a result of the 2019 EU 
Cybersecurity Act, Note 12 might be required.

The need for consistency
In many cases, the range of activity across 
regions, sectors, technologies, and operational 
risk management areas is being pursued 
simultaneously, resulting in potential overlap 
or inconsistency in scope, requirements, 
and complexity for organizations seeking to 
leverage guidance or demonstrate compliance. 
Without a universally accepted definition of 
IoT, scope is especially challenging for IoT and 
OT device regulations. The examples above 
potentially apply to “connected products and 
ancillary services,” “consumer connectable 
products,” and “wireless devices.” At the same 
time, many governments aim to implement 
more robust assessment regimes to better 
understand whether and how organizations 
and products meet current, emerging, and 
evolving requirements. As these trends merge, 
complexity will increase. Encouragingly, questions 
posed during the EU Cyber Resilience Act 
consultation explored how new regulation could 
potentially interact with existing cybersecurity 
regulation, indicating intent to avoid conflicting 
cybersecurity requirements.
Iterative approaches that are risk\-based 
and outcome\- or process\-oriented (versus 
implementation\-specific) could foster enhanced 
cybersecurity and continuous improvement. 
Likewise, a focus on enabling interoperability 
across sectors, regions, and policy areas 
could consistently raise cybersecurity across 
interconnected global supply chains.

There are increasingly complex critical 
infrastructure cybersecurity policies in 
development across regions, sectors, 
and topic areas. This activity brings 
great opportunities and significant 
challenges. How governments proceed 
will be crucial to the future of digital 
transformation and ecosystem\-
wide security.
Accelerating ecosystem\-wide investments in software 
supply chain security and Zero Trust architecture
 
US Executive Order (EO) 14028 on 
improving cybersecurity has been a 
catalyst to expedite Microsoft’s ongoing 
initiatives to invest in our own and 
ecosystem\-wide supply chain security 
and to enable our customers to meet 
Zero Trust objectives.
We have long believed that enhancing the 
software supply chain requires sharing learnings 
and best practices, beginning with our public 
release of Microsoft’s Security Development 
Lifecycle about 15 years ago.
In addition, we are partnering closely with the 
National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence 
to demonstrate approaches to Zero Trust 
Architecture applied to both on\-premises and 
cloud technology and establishing new product 
capabilities, including the ability to enforce 
phishing\-resistant authentication for hybrid 
and multi\-cloud environments.
 
 
 
Today, we’re going beyond the EO’s 
requirements to demonstrate conformance 
with software supply chain security 
requirements and provide Software Bill of 
Materials (SBOM) information in two ways:
1\. First, we’re sharing an open\-source version 
of our SBOM generator tool, which we built 
to be easily integrated with CI/CD pipelines 
supporting builds on Windows, Linux, Mac, 
iOS, and Android platforms. Note 13
2\. Second, we’re contributing to the 
development of industry standards for 
Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, 
and Trust (SCITT). This will allow for the 
automated exchange of verifiable supply 
chain information, including artifacts that 
demonstrate conformance with requirements 
such as those resulting from the EO’s 
software supply chain guidance.
Actionable insights

 IoT and OT exposed: 
Trends and attacks 
The increasingly connected digital world 
means devices are rapidly coming online, 
communicating with larger systems, 
collecting data, and creating visibility across 
formerly obscured spaces. This brings 
opportunity for organizations and threat 
actors alike, with the business of cybercrime 
becoming both a multi\-billion dollar 
industry and risk.
IoT devices—including everything from printers 
to web cameras, climate control devices, and 
building accesses controls—pose unique 
security risks to individuals, organizations, and 
networks. While critical to many organizations’ 
operations, they can quickly become a liability 
and security risk. The rapid adoption of IoT 
solutions in almost every industry has increased 
the number of attack vectors and the exposure 
risk of organizations. 
Malware as a service has moved into large 
scale operations against civil infrastructure and 
utilities (including hospitals, oil and gas, electrical 
grids, transportation services, and other critical 
infrastructure) as well as corporate networks. 
Significant research efforts are required by threat 
actors to uncover and exploit the configuration of 
operating environments and embedded IoT and 
OT devices.
IoT devices pose unique security 
risks as entry and pivot points in the 
network. Millions of IoT devices are 
unpatched or exposed.
Exposed devices can be discovered through 
internet search tools by identifying services 
listening on open network ports. These ports 
are commonly used for remote management of 
devices. If not secured correctly, an exposed IoT 
device can be used as a pivot point into another 
layer of the enterprise network as unauthorized 
users can remotely access the ports. We have 
observed a variety of threat actors attempting to 
exploit vulnerabilities in internet exposed devices 
ranging from cameras to routers to thermostats. 
However, despite the risk, millions of devices 
remain unpatched or exposed.

Revamped malware utility
As cybercrime groups have evolved, so has their 
deployment of malware and choice of targets. 
In the past year, we observed attacks against 
common IoT protocols—such as Telnet—
drop significantly, in some cases as much as 
60 percent. At the same time, botnets were 
repurposed by cybercrime groups and nation 
state actors. The persistence of malware, such as 
Mirai, highlights the modularity of these attacks 
and the adaptability of existing threats.

 IoT and OT exposed: 
 Trends and attacks 
Continued
Mirai evolved to infect a wide range of IoT 
devices including internet protocol cameras, 
security camera digital video recorders, and 
routers. The attack vector bypassed legacy 
security controls and poses a risk for endpoints 
within the network by exploiting additional 
vulnerabilities and moving laterally. Mirai has 
been redesigned multiple times, with variants 
adapting to different architectures and exploiting 
both known and zero\-day vulnerabilities to 
compromise new attack vectors.
The use of Mirai grew among both 32\- and 64\-bit 
x86 CPU architectures over the past year, and the 
malware was given new capabilities that were 
rapidly adopted by nation state and criminal 
groups. Nation state attacks now leverage new 
variants of existing botnets in distributed denial 
of service (DDoS) attacks on foreign adversaries.
As revenue from attacks against IoT devices 
declined in 2022, we observed several threat 
actor groups abusing vulnerabilities—such as 
Log4j and Spring4Shell—to deliver a malicious 
payload to devices such as servers, infecting 
them and recruiting them into large botnets 
carrying out DDoS attacks. The revamped 
utility of malware designed to target vulnerable 
IoT devices has serious implications for both 
organizations and nations, as lateral movement 
can expose backdoors to additional payloads 
and other devices on networks.
Many industrial control system protocols 
are unmonitored and therefore vulnerable to 
OT\-specific attacks. This can mean increased 
risk for critical infrastructure.
 
 
Relative prevalence of user name and password pairs seen 
among IoT/OT devices in 45 days of sensor signals
Using common username and password pairs increases risk of compromise. Based on a sample size of over 
39 million IoT and OT devices, those using identical usernames and passwords represented around 20 percent.

While weak configurations and default

observed many web\-based exploits utilizing 
HTTP. We observed this increase in attacks 
on web\-based services using legacy botnets. 
Meanwhile, there was a decrease in the number 
of open telnet ports on the internet, a positive 
sign for network security as botnets which posed 
historical risk to devices are losing relevance. 
Despite this decrease in open telnet ports, we still 
observed persistent botnets in sensor networks.

Industrial control system protocol vulnerabilities
We looked into OT data from our cloud 
connected sensors, revealing the most common 
industrial control system (ICS) protocols. 
These protocols provide insights into the nature 
of these devices and their attack surface. This is 
especially relevant to the security of critical 
infrastructure. Some key learnings are:
1\. Most of the protocols represented are 
proprietary, so standard IT monitoring tools 
won’t have adequate security visibility across 
these devices and protocols. As a result, 
networks are left unmonitored and therefore 
more vulnerable to OT\-specific attacks.
2\. There is a large variety of vendor\-specific 
protocols. This means vendor\-specific security 
solutions won’t be able to adequately cover 
the whole network. Microsoft prioritizes 
a vendor agnostic approach, to provide 
security coverage for the broad variety of 
different devices.
3\. Organizations should ensure these protocols 
are not exposed directly to the internet from 
their networks. This exposure could pose a 
major security risk due to vulnerabilities and 
the unsecure nature of these protocols.
Malware such as Mirai persists by developing 
new capabilities and is being adopted by 
cybercrime groups and nation state actors, 
leveraging new variants of existing botnets 
in DDoS attacks on foreign adversaries.
Actionable insights
 
1
Ensure devices are robust by applying 
patches, changing default passwords, 
and default SSH ports.
 
2
 
Reduce the attack surface by eliminating 
unnecessary internet connections and 
open ports, restricting remote access by 
blocking ports, denying remote access, 
and using VPN services.
 
3
Use an IoT/OT\-aware network detection 
and response (NDR) solution and 
a security information and event 
management (SIEM)/security orchestration 
and response (SOAR) solution to monitor 
devices for anomalous or unauthorized 
behaviors, such as communication with 
unfamiliar hosts.
 
4
Segment networks to limit an attacker’s 
ability to move laterally and compromise 
assets after initial intrusion. IoT devices 
and OT networks should be isolated from 
corporate IT networks through firewalls.
 
5
Ensure ICS protocols are not exposed 
directly to the internet.

 Supply chain and 
firmware hacking 
Almost every internet\-connected device 
has firmware, which is software embedded 
in the device’s hardware or circuit board. 
Over the past few years, we have seen 
increased targeting of firmware to launch 
devastating attacks. As firmware is likely to 
continue to be a valuable target for threat 
actors, organizations must protect against 
firmware hacking.
Firmware is responsible for a device’s primary 
functions, such as connecting to a network 
or storing data. Firmware is found in routers, 
cameras, televisions, and other devices used in 
Enterprises (IoT) along with industrial control 
equipment (OT) used in critical infrastructure. 
Historically, firmware has been written 
with unsecured code, creating significant 
vulnerabilities which can be exploited to take 
over the device or inject malicious code into 
the firmware.
This risk is compounded when it comes to 
the supply chain. Most devices are built using 
software and hardware components from 
numerous manufacturers as well as open\-
source libraries. In many cases device operators 
do not have visibility into the hardware and 
software bill of materials (H/SBOM) to evaluate 
the supply chain risk of devices on their 
network. In June 2020, vulnerabilities were 
disclosed in a networking stack used by many 
different manufacturers affecting hundreds 
of millions of IoT devices in the consumer and 
industrial equipment space. Note 14 In some cases, 
the network stack was rebranded by other 
vendors and there was no indication a device 
was vulnerable. We see a growing threat of 
malicious actors targeting this software and 
hardware supply chain of IoT/OT devices to 
compromise organizations.
The firmware updating process varies widely 
across devices, and the complexity and logistical 
challenge of performing it impacts the update 
frequency. It is not always possible to determine 
if a device is running the latest firmware, making 
it difficult for security professionals to monitor 
and ensure the security posture in their IoT 
and OT devices. In addition, some devices have 
firmware that is not cryptographically signed, 
enabling them to be updated without verification 
from the user. These weaknesses further open the 
devices up to supply chain attacks throughout 
the production and distribution chain.
To address these threats, Microsoft invests 
significantly in ensuring the security and integrity 
of the firmware as it moves through various 
stages of the supply chain, and in attesting at any 
time that it has not been tampered with during 
ingestion or along the way. This will allow us to 
validate trust between each pipeline segment 
and provide a certified and provable end\-to\-end 
chain of custody for every component we ship 
to customers. We are working with our partners 
to bring this chip\-to\-cloud security to all devices 
on the enterprise and OT network.
 
 
 
“ICT infrastructure suppliers are increasingly 
targets as they enable widespread replication 
of a single attack. At the same time, global 
legislation, regulation, and customer demands 
for supply chain security and resiliency are on 
the rise, often diverging in their requirements.
The solution is partnership. Together with 
suppliers and global governments, Microsoft 
is committed to addressing security across our 
supply chain ecosystem, exceeding demands 
from customers and regulators alike. To do 
this, we are driving a comprehensive approach 
to security and operational resiliency that is 
flexibly deployed across the supply chain.
Driving firmware integrity from design 
through to device operation is key to our 
collective approach. Ensuring suppliers’ SDL 
processes and deploying hardware root of 
trust innovation are examples of how we can 
‘build in’ supply chain integrity.
Our community is leveraging collective 
research and development spanning new 
anti\-tampering techniques and cryptographic 
mechanisms, combined with ongoing 
monitoring and anomaly detection. Together, 
we are progressing in minimizing the allure 
of supply chain as an attack surface.”

Spotlight on firmware 
vulnerabilities 
Attackers are increasingly leveraging 
vulnerabilities in IoT device firmware 
to infiltrate corporate networks. 
Unlike traditional IT endpoints that 
use XDR agents to identify weaknesses, 
vulnerability identification within IoT/OT 
devices is much more elusive.
A recent survey conducted by Microsoft and 
the Ponemon Institute highlights both the 
opportunity and the security challenge of IoT/
OT devices in an enterprise. Note 15 While 68 percent 
of respondents believe the adoption of IoT/OT is 
critical to their strategic digital transformation, 
60 percent recognize that IoT/OT security is 
one of the least secured aspects of the IT/
OT infrastructure.
An example of attackers using vulnerabilities 
in IoT device firmware to infiltrate a network 
is the Trickbot trojan which leveraged default 
passwords and vulnerabilities in Mikrotik 
routers Note 16 to bypass corporate defense systems. 
The fundamental challenge with IoT device 
firmware is the lack of visibility into the security 
posture and vulnerabilities of devices.
 
While there are solutions available to build secure 
devices, there are billions of devices already 
on the market and deployed in enterprises. 
These are known as brownfield devices. In 2021, 
Microsoft acquired ReFirm Labs to shine a light 
on brownfield device security and enable device 
builders to improve the security of their products. 
ReFirm Labs analyzes the binary firmware image 
of a device and produces a detailed report on 
potential security weaknesses. Note 17 This technology 
is being incorporated into a future release of 
Microsoft Defender for IoT.
Over the past year, we examined aggregate 
results of the unique firmware scanned by 
our customers. While not every weakness 
discovered might be exploitable, they 
underscore the fundamental challenge 
of device firmware security.
Note the types of weaknesses that exist in IoT/OT 
devices would never be acceptable on traditional 
Windows or Linux endpoints.
• Weak passwords: Twenty\-seven percent 
of the firmware images scanned contained 
accounts with passwords encoded using 
weak algorithms (MD5/DES), which are 
easily broken by attackers.
 
 
 
• Known vulnerabilities: Like other systems, 
IoT/OT device firmware extensively leveraged 
open\-source libraries. However, devices 
frequently ship with out\-of\-date versions of 
these components. In our analysis, 32 percent 
of the images contained at least 10 known 
vulnerabilities (CVEs) rated as critical (9\.0 or 
higher). Four percent contained at least 10 
critical vulnerabilities that were more than 
six years old.
• Expired certificates: Certificates are used to 
authenticate connections and identities, as 
well as protect sensitive data, but 13 percent 
of the images analyzed contained at least 10 
certificates that had expired more than three 
years ago.
 
 
• Software components: Thirty\-six percent of 
the images contain software components 
Microsoft recommends be excluded in IoT 
devices such as packet capture tools (tcpdump, 
libpcap), which can be leveraged for network 
reconnaissance as part of an attack chain.

Firmware attacks in the wild 
Viasat: Using a firmware vulnerability 
to target satellite communication
In February 2022, a satellite network incident 
disconnected a strategic communication network 
with impacts felt across Europe. Viasat’s KA\-SAT 
system received a large amount of traffic that 
disconnected many modems and a denial of 
service attack was initiated against the network. 
As fixed broadband was disrupted, thousands 
of wind turbines became remotely inaccessible 
to operators and malicious wiper malware was 
deployed to affected modems. The disruption 
affected more than 30,000 satellite terminals 
used by companies and organizations 
for communication.
Cyclops Blink: Using a firmware supply 
chain attack to target firewall gateways
For threat actors, the development and 
expansion of command and control (C2\) and 
attack infrastructure is a crucial component of 
success. As the need for a stable C2 infrastructure 
has grown, routers have become a desirable 
attack vector due to their infrequent patching 
and lack of comprehensive security solutions.
 
 
 
Microsoft is partnering with 
government and industry on firmware 
analysis technology to bring deeper 
visibility into device security and 
provide full lifecycle security for 
device builders and operators.
Since June 2019, a nation state\-affiliated 
advanced persistent threat (APT) group used 
the modular malware Cyclops Blink to target 
vulnerable WatchGuard firewall devices and 
ASUS routers by executing malicious firmware 
updates and recruiting them to a large botnet. 
The malware successfully infects devices by 
exploiting a known vulnerability that allows a 
privilege escalation, enabling the threat actors to 
manage the device. Once infected, the malware 
allows further modules to be installed and evades 
firmware updates. Compromised devices have 
been observed connecting to C2 servers hosted 
on other WatchGuard devices. Issuing many SSL 
certificates for their C2 on various TCP ports, 
Cyclops Blink operators gained privileged remote 
access to networks by executing malicious 
firmware updates and by evading traditional 
security methods such as scanning.
How Microsoft is improving supply 
chain security
Microsoft is partnering with government and 
industry to address these IoT and OT device 
security challenges (see the discussion on page 
66\). Our contribution will include leveraging 
firmware analysis technology to provide device 
operators with visibility into the security posture 
of the devices on their network. This will enable 
customers to identify and prioritize devices in 
need of additional protections, upgrades, or 
replacement—and drive demand for device 
builders to invest in device security. At the 
same time, we are supporting builders with 
comprehensive solutions to architect secure 
devices and adopt secure development lifecycles.
Another key component is providing builders 
and operators robust infrastructure to allow 
device firmware to be updated as security 
issues are discovered and resolved. Microsoft is 
bringing together firmware analysis and Defender 
for IoT with Device Update for IoT Hub to provide 
a solution to address the full lifecycle of IoT and 
OT device security. These are important steps 
in realizing our vision for customers to secure 
the infrastructure by adoption of devices that 
support a Zero Trust approach to their IoT and 
OT solutions. Note 18
Attackers are increasingly targeting 
vulnerabilities in IoT device firmware 
to infiltrate corporate networks.
 
 
Actionable insights
 
1
Gain deeper visibility into IoT/OT 
devices on your network and prioritize 
them by risk to the enterprise if they 
are compromised.
 
2
Use firmware scanning tools to understand 
potential security weaknesses and work 
with vendors to identify how to mitigate 
the risks for high\-risk devices.
 
3
Positively influence the security of IoT/
OT devices by requiring the adoption 
of secure development lifecycle best 
practices by your vendors.

 Reconnaissance\-based 
OT attacks 
Complex supply chains use specific design 
information to plan the actual system. 
Of the myriad assets that compose this 
design information, the most sensitive is the 
project file, which defines the environment 
and its assets. This file is a crucial strategic 
target for threat actors seeking to gain 
access and deploy a successful attack 
wholly tailored to the environment.
Targeting industrial systems to disrupt 
operational processes involves two steps. 
1\. First, the attacker must access the OT network. 
This can be done by entering through IoT devices 
on the enterprise side of the network (Purdue 
Model Level 4\) and crossing the IT\-OT boundary, 
traditionally separated by firewalls and networking 
equipment, into the operation and control levels.
2\. Second, the network devices must be 
identified. Industrial systems use standard 
devices and components in customized 
architectures specifically designed for their 
environments. One of these standard devices 
is the programmable logic controller (PLC). 
Every manufacturer develops unique interfaces 
and functions for their PLCs, which are a 
crucial component of industrial systems, and 
these devices are further configured with 
customized schemas specifically designed for 
the customer’s environments.
The unique configuration of each PLC is 
described in the project file, which contains the 
definition of the environment and its assets, the 
ladder logic, and more. 
In most environments that show evidence of an 
attack, analysis shows the timeline preceding the 
attack far exceeds the length of the attack itself. 
Threat actors often invest months in simulating 
the environment and its assets remotely, making 
many attempts to construct a model and 
prepare their targeted attack. As environments 
continuously change and integrate new devices, 
vulnerabilities are created specifically around 
the data in the project and configuration files. 
The theft of a project file can advance an attack 
by weeks or months and enable attackers to 
model the target environment rapidly and 
accurately, increasing the difficulty in detecting 
malicious activity.
Industroyer and Incontroller
We have observed increased attacks on 
organizations, critical infrastructure, and 
government targets by state sponsored actors 
using modular malware and attack frameworks. 
New attempts to interfere with critical operations 
in Ukraine underscore the growing threat of 
reconnaissance\-based OT attacks that are 
highly tailored to their target environments. 
The extended reconnaissance and research 
phases carried out by nation state cyber actors 
points to a strategy of using cyber warfare to 
cripple infrastructure remotely to meet specific 
strategic or operational goals in blended cyber\-
kinetic operations and political strategy.

In early 2022, two adaptable critical OT attacks 
were identified. A cyber\-physical attack on 
electrical substations and protection relays 
in Ukraine was carried out with customized 
malware, including a variant of Industroyer, 
a malware known to have caused power outages 
in Ukraine after its deployment in 2016\.
Industroyer2 is the first known redeployment 
of malicious OT attack malware on a new 
target. It utilized the IEC104 protocol (standard 
protocol for power system monitoring and 
control) plugin developed for Industroyer and 
targeted mostly PLC\-like remote terminal units 
with model number ABB RTU540/560\. The writer 
of this malware used knowledge of the victim’s 
environment to issue commands repeatedly 
to predetermined outputs, ensuring they 
could not be turned on manually. This ensured 
longer lasting power outages and a more 
damaging impact.
Incontroller, a modular attack framework 
identified during the same period, is a modular 
toolkit that significantly reduces the lead time 
to penetrate and attack OT devices, bypassing 
legacy security solutions. The general\-purpose 
toolkit has data\-collection, reconnaissance, and 
attack capabilities that are highly customizable 
to different environments and can greatly impact 
the research phase for an OT attack, reducing 
the time necessary to perform reconnaissance, 
supporting the simulation of environments 
by extracting information about devices and 
their configurations.
The Incontroller framework supports protocols 
for Schneider Electric and Omron PLCs and 
collects information, such as firmware version, 
model type, and connected devices. The toolkit 
can issue commands to change configurations 
and turn outputs on and off. Once an 
environment is accessed, the framework supports 
implanting backdoors in devices for the delivery 
of more payloads, issuing vulnerabilities to 
increase access points, uploading of ladder logic, 
and the ability to initiate DoS attacks. The generic 
nature of the toolkit enables a threat actor to 
attack an environment quickly without needing 
to write new attacks for every PLC or location. 
This allows the actor to easily interact with 
different types of machines potentially across 
many industries.

 An overview of 
Cyber Influence 
Operations 
Today’s foreign influence 
operations utilize new methods 
and technologies, making 
their campaigns designed 
to erode trust more efficient 
and effective. 
Nation states are increasingly using sophisticated 
influence operations to distribute propaganda 
and impact public opinion both domestically and 
internationally. These campaigns erode trust, 
increase polarization, and threaten democratic 
processes. Skilled Advanced Persistent 
Manipulator actors are using traditional media 
together with internet and social media to vastly 
increase the scope, scale, and efficiency of their 
campaigns, and the outsized impact they are 
having in the global information ecosystem. 
In the past year, we have seen these operations 
used as part of Russia’s hybrid war in Ukraine, 
but have also seen Russia and other nations, 
including China and Iran, increasingly turning 
to social\-media powered propaganda operations 
to extend their global influence. 
 
 
 
 
Cyber influence operations are becoming increasingly 
sophisticated as more governments and nation states 
are using these operations to shape opinion, discredit 
adversaries, and promote discord.

Cyber Influence 
Operations
Introduction 
Democracy needs 
trustworthy information 
to flourish. A key area of 
focus for Microsoft are the 
influence operations being 
developed and perpetuated by 
nation states. These campaigns 
erode trust, increase 
polarization, and threaten 
democratic processes.
Foreign influence operations have always been 
a threat to the information ecosystem. However, 
what differs in the age of the internet and 
social media is the vastly increased scope, scale, 
and efficiency of campaigns, and the outsized 
impact they can have on the health of the global 
information ecosystem.
The age\-old adage that “a lie gets halfway 
around the world before the truth has a chance 
to put its shoes on,” is now being borne out with 
data. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
(MIT) study Note 1 found that falsehoods are 70 percent 
more likely to be retweeted than the truth 
and they reach the first 1,500 people six times 
faster. The information ecosystem has become 
increasingly murky as propaganda campaigns 
flourish on the internet and social media and 
undermine trust in traditional news. In a 2021 
study, Note 2 only seven percent of US adults said they 
have “a great deal” of trust and confidence in 
newspapers, television, and radio news reporting, 
while 34 percent reported “none at all.”
Microsoft has been working to identify the main 
actors, threats, and tactics in the foreign cyber 
influence space and to share lessons learned. 
In June this year, we published a comprehensive 
report on the lessons learned from Ukraine, 
which contained a detailed look at Russia’s 
cyber influence operations. Note 3
 
 
 
We are also studying how advanced technologies 
such as deep fakes can be weaponized and 
undermine the credibility of journalists. 
And we are working with industry, government, 
and academia to develop better ways to detect 
synthetic media and restore trust—such as 
artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can 
spot fakes.
The rapidly changing nature of the information 
ecosystem and nation state online propaganda, 
including the melding of traditional cyberattacks 
with influence operations and the interference in 
democratic elections, requires a whole\-of\-society 
approach to mitigate against both online and 
offline threats to democracy.
Microsoft is dedicated to supporting a healthy 
information ecosystem in which trusted news 
and information thrive. We are developing tools 
and threat detection capabilities to combat 
the evolving and expanding risk of nation state 
driven influence operations. To enable this work, 
we recently acquired Miburo Solutions, we 
partner with third\-party validators such as the 
Global Disinformation Index and NewsGuard, and 
we participate and at times lead multistakeholder 
partnerships, including the Coalition for Content 
Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). Only by 
working together can we succeed in taking 
on those who seek to undermine democratic 
processes and institutions.

 Trends in cyber 
influence operations 
Cyber influence operations are becoming 
increasingly sophisticated as technology 
evolves at pace. We are seeing an overlap 
and expansion of the tools used in 
traditional cyberattacks being applied 
to cyber influence operations. Additionally, 
we are seeing an increased coordination 
and amplification among nation states.
Microsoft invested in combating foreign influence 
operations this year by the acquisition of Miburo 
Solutions, a company specializing in analysis of foreign 
influence operations. Combining these analysts 
with Microsoft’s threat context analysts, Microsoft 
formed the Digital Threat Analysis Center (DTAC). 
DTAC analyzes and reports on nation state threats, 
including both cyberattacks and influence operations, 
combining information and threat intelligence 
with geopolitical analysis to provide insights and 
inform effective response and protections.
More than three\-quarters of people across the 
world said they worry about the weaponization of 
information, Note 4 and our data support these concerns. 
Microsoft and its partners have been tracking how 
nation state actors are using influence operations 
to achieve their strategic objectives and political 
goals. In addition to destructive cyberattacks and 
cyber espionage efforts, authoritarian regimes 
are increasingly using cyber influence operations 
to shape opinion, discredit adversaries, incite fear, 
promote discord, and distort reality.
These foreign cyber influence operations 
typically have three stages:
Pre\-position
Like the pre\-positioning of malware within 
an organization’s computer network, foreign 
cyber influence operations pre\-position false 
narratives in the public domain on the internet. 
The pre\-positioning tactic has long helped 
more traditional cyber activities, especially 
if IT administrators scan their most recent 
network activity. Malware that lays dormant for 
an extended time on a network can make its 
subsequent use more effective. False narratives 
that lay unnoticed on the internet can make 
subsequent references seem more credible.
Launch
Often at the time most beneficial to achieve 
the goals of the actor, a coordinated campaign 
is launched to propagate narratives through 
government\-backed and influenced media 
outlets and social media channels.
Amplification
Finally, nation state\-controlled media and proxies 
amplify narratives inside targeted audiences. 
Often, unwitting tech enablers extend the 
narratives’ reach. For example, online advertising 
can help finance activities and coordinated 
content delivery systems 
can flood search engines.
This three\-step approach was applied in late 
2021 to support the Russian false narrative 
around purported bioweapons and biolabs in 
Ukraine. This narrative was first uploaded to 
YouTube on November 29, 2021 as part of a 
regular English\-language show by a Moscow\-
based American expatriate who claimed that 
US\-funded biolabs in Ukraine were connected to 
bioweapons. The story went largely unnoticed 
for months. On February 24, 2022, just as Russian 
tanks crossed the border, the narrative was sent 
into battle. A data analytics team at Microsoft 
identified 10 Russian\-controlled or influenced 
news sites that simultaneously published 
reports on February 24 pointing back to “last 
year’s report” and seeking to give it credence. 
In addition, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
officials held press conferences that further 
seeded false claims about US biolabs in the 
information environment. Russian\-sponsored 
teams then worked to amplify the narrative on 
social media and internet sites more broadly. 
We are seeing authoritarian regimes around 
the world working together to pollute the 
information ecosystem to their mutual advantage. 
For instance, throughout the COVID\-19 pandemic 
Russia, Iran, and China employed propaganda and 
influence operations using a blend of overt, semi\-
covert, and covert methods of dissemination 
to target democracies and further geopolitical 
goals (discussed further on page 76\). The three 
regimes played on one another’s messaging and 
information ecosystems to promote preferred 
narratives. Much of this coverage consisted of 
criticisms or conspiracy theories about the United 
States and its allies peddled by government figures 
in official statements while promoting their own 
vaccines and responses to COVID\-19 as superior 
to the United States and other democracies. 
By amplifying one another, state operated media 
outlets created an ecosystem in which negative 
coverage of democracies—or positive coverage 
of Russia, Iran, and China—produced by one 
state media outlet was reinforced by others.

To add to the challenge, private sector 
technology entities might unwittingly 
enable these campaigns. Enablers can include 
companies that register internet domains, 
host websites, promote material on social 
media and search sites, channel traffic, and 
help pay for these exercises through digital 
advertising. Organizations must be aware of the 
tools and methods employed by authoritarian 
regimes for cyber influence operations so they 
can detect and then prevent the spread of 
campaigns. There is also a growing need to help 
consumers develop a more sophisticated ability 
to identify foreign influence operations and limit 
engagement with their narratives or content.
Cyber influence operations, including 
authoritarian propaganda, are a threat 
to democracies worldwide as they 
erode trust, increase polarization, 
and threaten democratic processes.

Spotlight on influence 
operations during COVID\-19 
and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 
Nation states seeking to control the 
information environment throughout the 
pandemic and during the Russian invasion 
of Ukraine provide stark examples of how 
authoritarian regimes blend cyber and 
information operations.
COVID\-19 propaganda
Russia, Iran, and China employed propaganda 
and influence campaigns throughout the 
COVID\-19 pandemic. COVID\-19 featured 
prominently in these campaigns in two 
central ways:
1\. Representations of the pandemic itself.
2\. Campaigns that used COVID\-19 as a strategic 
device to achieve broader political objectives.
The broad objective of these types of campaigns 
is two\-fold: first, to undermine democracies, 
democratic institutions, and the image of the 
United States and its allies on the global stage; 
and second, to bolster their own standing 
domestically and internationally.
An example of this can be seen in the 
messaging by known Russian accounts and 
media organizations targeting English language 
readers versus how the Russian government 
communicated with its own people regarding 
the vaccine and severity of COVID\-19\.
 
Topics covered by top 10 most\-viewed coronavirus stories on RT.com 
(October 2021–April 2022\)
Anti\-vaccine propaganda targets non\-Russian readers
 
 
Russian 
(Translated below to English)
English 
“Lockdowns and boosters 
prevent transmission”
“Vaccinations fail to curb transmission and are 
ineffective against new strains”
“Russian public figures are testing positive”
“Pfizer vaccine has dangerous side effects”
“Cases and deaths are increasing in Russia”
“Mass vaccination is politically motivated”
“The Sputnik V vaccine is highly effective”
“Pfizer and Moderna conduct 
unregulated trials”
“Vaccine proof needed on public transport”
 
Russian COVID\-19 messaging differs by language.
Campaigns that sought to obscure the origin 
of the COVID\-19 virus offer another example. 
Since the start of the pandemic, Russian, Iranian, 
and Chinese COVID\-19 propaganda boosted 
coverage from the others to amplify these 
central themes. Much of this coverage consisted 
of promoting criticisms or conspiracy theories 
about the United States. Regularly amplifying 
one another, state media outlets developed 
an ecosystem in which negative coverage of 
democracies or positive coverage of Russia, 
Iran, and China by one state media outlet was 
reinforced by the others time and again.
One such example is the early suggestion 
by Russian and Iranian state media that 
COVID\-19 might be a bioweapon created by 
the United States. This claim circulated on fringe 
conspiracy websites early in the pandemic after 
an interview with a law professor who claimed 
he believed COVID\-19 was created as a weapon. Note 6 
After the interview was published on a few 
websites with limited reach, the story was picked 
up by state\-owned media outlets. PressTV, 
an Iranian English and French language outlet 
sponsored by the Iranian government, Note 7 published 
an English\-language story in February 2020 
titled “Is coronavirus a US biowarfare weapon 
as Francis Boyle believes?” The article suggested 
the United States was behind the COVID\-19 
outbreak, writing, “in all US wars, radiological, 
chemical, biological and other banned weapons 
are used, inflicting a devastating toll on people 
in targeted areas.” Note 8 Russian state media outlets 
and Chinese government accounts echoed the 
sentiment. Russia Today (RT)—a state\-owned 
outlet known for its role in disseminating Kremlin 
propaganda Note 9—published at least one story 
that promoted statements from Iranian officials 
claiming COVID\-19 might be a “product of US 
‘biological attack’ aimed at Iran \& China” Note 10 and 
pushed out social media posts suggesting as 
much. For example, an RT tweet from February 
27, 2020, read: “Show of hands, who isn’t going 
to be surprised if it ever gets revealed that 
\#coronavirus is a bioweapon?” Note 11
The war in Ukraine—propaganda as a weapon 
of war
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine provides a distinct 
example of how cyber influence operations can 
be melded with more traditional cyberattacks 
and on the ground military operations to 
maximize their impact.
In the lead up to the invasion of Ukraine, 
Microsoft threat intelligence analysts saw at 
least six separate Russia\-aligned actors launch 
more than 237 cyberattacks against Ukraine. 
These campaigns sought to degrade services 
and institutions, disrupt Ukrainians’ access to 
reliable information, and sow doubts about 
the country’s leadership.

In a Microsoft report released in April 2022, 
we showcased how in an apparent attempt to 
control the information environment in Kyiv, 
Russia launched a missile strike against a TV 
tower in Kyiv on the same day it launched a 
destructive malware against a major Ukrainian 
media company. Note 12
In another example of how cyberattacks and 
influence operations converge, a Russian threat 
actor sent Ukrainian citizens emails purporting 
to be from residents of Mariupol, blaming the 
Ukrainian government for the war’s escalation 
and calling on their countrymen to push back 
against the government. These emails were 
specifically addressed (by name) to those 
receiving the email, indicating they might 
have had their information stolen in an earlier 
espionage related cyberattack. No malicious links 
were included, which suggests intent was pure 
influence operations.
Featuring purportedly hacked, leaked, or 
otherwise sensitive material is a common tactic 
used by Russian actors in influence operations. 
Throughout the war in Ukraine, pro\-Russia social 
media channels have promoted what they claim 
are leaked or otherwise sensitive materials from 
Ukrainian sources. Leaked or sensitive material 
is used by pro\-Russia social media channels and 
outlets as part of a broader influence strategy 
to degrade trust in institutions and cast doubt 
on mainstream narratives. This information can 
be manipulated to create propaganda targeting 
Ukraine and the West, diminish trust in digital 
security, and erode support for Western aid 
to Ukraine.
Russia used other information attacks to shape 
public opinion after events on the ground to 
obscure or undermine facts. For example, on 
March 7, Russia pre\-positioned a narrative 
through a filing with the United Nations (UN) 
that a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine, 
had been emptied and was being used as a 
military site. On March 9, Russia bombed the 
hospital. After the news of the bombing broke, 
Russia’s UN representative Dmitry Polyanskiy 
tweeted that coverage of the bombing was “fake 
news” and cited Russia’s earlier claims about its 
alleged use as a military site. Russia then pushed 
this narrative broadly across Russian controlled 
websites for two weeks following the attack on 
the hospital.

Spotlight on influence 
operations during COVID\-19 
and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 
Continued
 
Russia’s whitewashing of atrocities has continued 
as the war has progressed. For instance, in late 
June of 2022, Russian media outlets and influencers 
portrayed the bombing of a shopping mall as 
justified and necessary, falsely claiming it was not 
in use as a mall, but rather in use as an armory 
for Ukrainian territorial defense forces. Note 13 Several 
pro\-Kremlin bloggers on Telegram posted and 
amplified content reinforcing the “false flag” 
narrative, with bloggers pointing to alleged 
indicators of fabrication including the presence 
of people in military uniform in footage from 
the scene Note 14 and the absence of women in the 
footage. Note 15 Russia launched campaigns by relying 
on a built\-out system of propaganda messengers 
and mediums. The amplification of these stories 
online provides Russia the ability to deflect blame 
on the international stage and avoid accountability.
Nation states like Russia understand the value 
of using information derived from closed 
sources to influence public perceptions, using 
“hack and leak” campaigns to spread counter 
narratives and sow distrust.

Tracking the Russian 
Propaganda Index 
In January 2022, nearly one thousand US 
websites were referring traffic to Russian 
propaganda websites. The most common 
topics for Russian propaganda websites 
targeting a US audience were the war in 
Ukraine, US domestic politics (either pro\-
Trump or pro\-Biden) and COVID\-19 and 
vaccine\-related narratives.
The Russian Propaganda Index (RPI) monitors 
the flow of news from Russian state\-controlled 
and sponsored news outlets and amplifiers as a 
proportion of overall news traffic on the internet. 
The RPI can be used to chart the consumption 
of Russian propaganda across the internet and 
in different geographies on a precise timeline. 
Microsoft notes, however, that we can only 
observe the Russian propaganda posted to 
previously identified websites. We do not have 
insight into propaganda on other types of 
websites, including authoritative news websites, 
unidentified websites, and social network groups.

An assessment of the RPI in New Zealand showed 
a spike in late 2021 that was related to COVID\-19 
propaganda. This spike in Russian propaganda 
consumption in New Zealand preceded an 
increase in public protests in early 2022 in 
Wellington. A second spike was clearly related to 
the Russian invasion of Ukraine and exceeded the 
RPIs of Australia and the United States.

and the United States
Russian propaganda consumption in New Zealand is 
similar to Australia until the first week of December 
2021\. After December, Russian propaganda 
consumption in New Zealand increased by over 
30 percent relative to consumption in Australia and 
the United States.

Synthetic media 
 
We are entering a golden era for AI\-
enabled media creation and manipulation. 
 
Microsoft analysts note this is driven by two 
key trends: the proliferation of easy\-to\-use 
 
tools and services for artificially creating 
 
highly realistic synthetic images, videos, 
 
audio, and text, and the ability to quickly 
 
disseminate content optimized 
 
for specific audiences. 
 
Neither of these developments is inherently 
 
problematic on its own. AI\-based technology 
 
can be used to create fun and exciting digital 
 
content, whether creating purely synthetic or 
 
enhancing existing material. These tools are 
 
being widely used by enterprises for advertising 
 
and communications and by individuals to create 
 
engaging content for their followers. However, 
 
synthetic media, when created and distributed 
 
with the intent to harm, has the potential to 
 
do serious damage to individuals, companies, 
 
institutions, and society. Microsoft has been a 
 
driving force in developing technologies and 
 
practices, both internally and across the wider 
 
media ecosystem, to limit this harm. 
This section explores insights from Microsoft 
 
analysis on the current state of the art technology 
 
for creating damaging synthetic content, the 
 
harms that can arise if this content is widely 
 
disseminated, and technical mitigations that 
 
can defend against synthetic media based 
 
cyber threats. 
Creating synthetic media 
The field of synthetic text and media is advancing 
 
incredibly fast as techniques that were once 
 
only possible with the vast computing resources 
 
of large movie studios are now integrated 
 
into phone apps. At the same time, tools are 
 
becoming easier to use and can generate content 
 
with a level of realism that can fool even forensic 
 
media specialists. We are very close to reaching 
 
the point at which anyone can create a synthetic 
 
video of anyone saying or doing anything. It’s 
 
not unreasonable to believe we are entering an 
 
era where a significant quantity of the content 
 
we see online is fully or partially synthetic using 
 
AI 
 techniques. 
With the availability of more 
 
sophisticated, easy\-to\-use, and widely 
 
available tools, synthetic content 
 
creation is on the rise and will soon 
 
be indistinguishable from reality. 
There are many high\-quality free and commercial 
 
image, video, and audio editing tools. These tools 
 
can be used to make simple but potentially 
 
damaging changes to digital content like adding 
 
misleading text, face\-swapping, and removing or 
 
altering context. Such “cheap fakes” are widely 
 
used to spread nefarious content, promote 
 
political ideologies, and damage reputations. 
 
A well\-known example is the 2019 Note 16 video of US 
 
Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, slurring her 
 
speech and appearing inebriated. Although it was 
 
quickly determined that the video was slowed 
 
to create the effect, the “cheap fake” spread 
far and wide before the original video and 
context surfaced. 
More sophisticated approaches to altering media 
content includes the application of advanced 
AI techniques to (a) create purely synthetic 
media, and (b) make more sophisticated edits 
of existing media. The term deepfake is often 
used for synthetic media that has been created 
using cutting\-edge AI techniques (the name 
comes from the deep neural networks that 
are sometimes used). These technologies are 
being developed as standalone apps, tools, 
and services and integrated into established 
commercial and open\-source editing tools. 
Such technologies are weaponized by bad actors 
hoping to damage individuals and institutions. 
Examples of deepfake techniques include: 
• Face swap (video, images)—replacing a face 
in a video with another. This technique can be 
used to attempt blackmail of an individual, 
company, or institution, or to place individuals 
in embarrassing locations or situations. 
• Puppeteering (video, images)—using a 
video to animate a still image or second video. 
This can make it appear an individual said 
something embarrassing or misleading. 
• Generative adversarial networks 
(video, images)—a family of techniques 
for generating photorealistic imagery. 
• Transformer models (video, images, text)— 
creating rich imagery from text descriptions. 
Such advanced AI\-based techniques are not yet 
widely used in cyber influence campaigns today, 
but we expect the problem to grow as the tools 
become easier to use and more widely available. 
The impact of synthetic media manipulation 
The use of information operations to cause harm 
or expand influence is not new. However, the 
speed with which information can spread, and 
our inability to quickly sort fact from fiction, 
mean the impact and harm caused by fakes and 
other synthetically generated malicious media 
can be much greater, as demonstrated with the 
Pelosi example. 
There are several categories of harm which 
we consider: market manipulation, payment 
fraud, vishing, impersonations, brand damage, 
reputational damage, and botnets. Many of 
these categories have widely reported real\-world 
examples, which could undermine our ability to 
separate fact from fiction. 
A longer\-term and more insidious threat is to our 
understanding of what is true if we can no longer 
trust what we see and hear. Because of this, any 
compromising image, audio, or video of a public 
or private figure can be dismissed as fake—an 
outcome known as The Liar’s Dividend. Note 17 Recent 
research Note 18 shows this abuse of technology 
is already being used to attack financial 
systems, although many other abuse scenarios 
are plausible.

Detecting synthetic media 
Efforts are underway across industry, 
government, and academia to develop better 
ways to detect and mitigate synthetic media 
and restore trust. There are several promising 
paths forward, as well as barriers that 
warrant consideration. 
One approach is to build AI\-based systems 
that can spot fakes—essentially “defensive” 
AI systems to counter the offensive AI systems. 
This is an area of active research where 
current systems for creating synthetic audio 
and video leave telltale artifacts that can be 
spotted by trained media forensic analysts and 
automated tools. 
Unfortunately, while current fakes have revealing 
flaws, the precise artifacts tend to be specific to 
a particular tool or algorithm. This means training 
on known fakes does not usually generalize to 
other algorithms as demonstrated in a 2020 
open competition to build deepfake image 
 
detectors. Note 19 It is tempting to increase investment 
 
in developing more advanced detectors, but 
 
Microsoft is highly skeptical this will result in 
 
meaningful improvements for two reasons: 
First, we have excellent physical models that 
 
reflect the real world. Current fake creators cut 
 
corners, resulting in detectable artifacts, but 
 
newer models will become ever more realistic. 
 
There is nothing inherently special about a 
 
real\-world scene captured by a camera that 
 
can’t be modeled by a computer. 
Second, advanced fake\-creation algorithms use a 
 
technique called Generative Adversarial Networks 
 
(GANs) as part of the creation process. A GAN 
 
plays two AI systems against each other using a 
 
generator to create the fake and a discriminator 
 
to detect fake images and train the generator. 
 
Any investment in developing a better detector 
 
will only enable the generator to improve the 
 
quality of the fakes.

Provenance for digital assets 
If detecting fakes is unreliable, what can be done 
 
to protect against the harmful uses of synthetic 
 
media? One important emerging technology is 
 
digital provenance—a mechanism that enables 
 
digital media creators with the ability to certify 
 
an asset and helps consumers identify whether 
 
or not the digital asset has been tampered with. 
 
Digital provenance is particularly important in 
 
the context of today’s social media networks 
 
given the speed with which content can travel 
 
the internet and the opportunity for bad actors 
 
to easily manipulate content. 
900% 
year over year increase 
 
in proliferation of 
deepfakes since 2019\. Note 20 
Digital Provenance Technology is a modern 
 
version of cryptographic document signing, 
 
designed to capture the source, edit history, and 
 
metadata of objects as they flow through today’s 
 
web. The vision and technical methods for 
 
enabling this type of end\-to\-end tamper\-proof 
 
certification of media was developed by a cross\-
team of researchers and scientists at Microsoft. 
 
We co\-lead a cross\-industry partnership aimed 
 
at bringing media provenance technology to life 
 
in Project Origin (founded by Microsoft, BBC, 
 
CBC/Radio\-Canada, and the New York Times) 
 
and engage in the Content Authenticity Initiative 
 
(founded by Adobe). Microsoft also worked with 
 
partners in technology and media services to 
 
establish the Coalition for Content Provenance 
 
and Authenticity (C2PA). C2PA is a standards 
 
organization that recently published the most 
 
advanced digital provenance specification to 
 
utilize with media assets including images, 
 
videos, audio, and text. 
 
A C2PA\-enabled object carries a manifest 
 
that protects the object and metadata from 
 
tampering, and the accompanying certificate 
 
identifies the publisher. 
Synthetic media was not originally 
 
designed to cause harm, but it is 
 
being weaponized by bad actors 
 
to undermine trust in individuals 
 
and 
 institutions. 
Digital provenance is a promising 
 
emerging technology that has the 
 
potential to help restore people’s trust 
 
in online media content by certifying 
 
the origin of a media asset. 
Publicly available solutions based on the C2PA 
 
specification are surfacing either as a new feature 
 
in existing products or new standalone apps 
 
and services. We expect most of the commonly 
 
used capture, editing, and authoring tools to be 
 
C2PA enabled in a few years. This presents an 
 
opportunity for enterprises to determine their 
 
needs and uses for digital provenance today, and 
 
to require this additional layer of protection in 
 
the tools they use in existing workflows.

Cyber Influence 
Operations
A holistic approach 
 
to protect against cyber 
influence 
 operations 
 
 
Microsoft is building on its already mature 
 
cyber threat intelligence infrastructure 
 
to develop a broader, more inclusive view 
 
of cyber influence operations. 
We use a framework for suggested response and 
 
mitigation strategies to combat the threat posed 
 
by operations, which can be divided into four 
 
key pillars: detect, disrupt, defend, and deter. 
In addition, Microsoft has adopted four principles 
 
to anchor our work in this space. First is a 
 
commitment to respect freedom of expression 
 
and uphold our customers’ ability to create, 
 
publish, and search for information via our 
 
platforms, products, and services. Second, we 
 
proactively work to prevent our platforms and 
 
products from being used to amplify foreign 
 
cyber influence sites and content. Third, we will 
 
not willfully profit from foreign cyber influence 
 
content or actors. Finally, we prioritize surfacing 
 
content to counter foreign cyber influence 
 
operations by utilizing internal and trusted 
 
third\-party data on our products. 
Detect 
As with cyber defense, the first step in countering 
 
foreign cyber influence operations is developing 
 
the capacity to detect them. No single company 
 
or organization can hope to individually make 
 
the progress that is needed. New, broader 
 
collaboration across the tech sector will be 
 
crucial, with progress in analyzing and reporting 
cyber influence operations relying heavily on 
 
the role of civil society, including in academic 
 
institutions 
 and 
 nonprofit 
 organizations. 
Recognizing this role, researchers Jake Shapiro 
 
and Alicia Wanless at Princeton University and 
 
the Carnegie Endowment for International 
 
Peace respectively have mapped out plans to 
 
launch the new “Institute for Research on the 
 
Information Environment” (IRIE). With support 
 
from Microsoft, the Knight Foundation, and Craig 
 
Newmark Philanthropies, the IRIE will create an 
 
inclusive multistakeholder research institution 
 
modeled after the European Organization 
 
for Nuclear Research (CERN). It will combine 
 
expertise in data processing and analysis to 
 
speed up and scale new discoveries in this space. 
 
Findings will be shared to inform policymakers, 
 
technology companies, and consumers 
 
more broadly. 
Defend 
The second strategic pillar is to shore up 
 
democratic defenses, a longstanding priority in 
 
need of investment and innovation. It should take 
 
account of the challenges technology has created 
 
to democracy, and the opportunities technology 
 
has created to defend democratic societies 
 
more 
 effectively. 
Microsoft’s strategy framework is 
 
aimed at helping cross\-sectoral 
 
stakeholders detect, disrupt, defend, 
 
and deter against propaganda— 
particularly campaigns by 
 
foreign 
 aggressors. 
It is appropriate to start with one of the great 
 
technological challenges of our age—the 
 
impact of the internet and digital advertising 
 
on traditional journalism. Since the 1700s, a free 
 
and independent press has played a special role 
 
in supporting every democracy on the planet— 
uncovering corruption, documenting wars, and 
 
illuminating the largest societal challenges of 
 
this and every other time. However, the internet 
 
has gutted local news by devouring advertising 
 
revenue and luring away paid subscribers. 
 
Many local newspapers have collapsed. One of 
 
the many insights from our recent work is towns 
 
that lack a newspaper are unknowingly and 
 
inevitably exposed to a greater than average 
 
volume of foreign propaganda. For these 
 
reasons, one of democracy’s critical defensive 
 
prongs must strengthen traditional journalism 
 
and a free press, especially at the local 
 
level. This requires ongoing investment 
 
and innovation that must reflect the 
 
local needs of different countries and 
 
continents. These issues are not easy, 
 
and they require multistakeholder 
 
approaches, which Microsoft 
 
and other tech companies 
 
are increasingly supporting. 
We also need new innovations in public policy, 
 
which needs to be a public priority. This can 
 
include laws that enable publishers to negotiate 
 
advertising revenue collectively with technology 
 
companies, and legislation that provides tax 
 
credits to relieve local newsrooms of a portion 
 
of their payroll taxes for journalists they employ. 
 
Journalists need many other tools for their craft, 
 
including the ability to separate content from 
 
legitimate and fraudulent sources. 
There is also a rapidly evolving need to help 
 
consumers develop a more sophisticated ability 
 
to identify nation state\-driven information 
 
operations. While this might seem daunting, 
 
it resembles the work the tech sector has 
 
long pursued to combat other cyber threats. 
 
Consider the education of consumers to look 
 
more carefully at an email address to help spot 
 
spam or other fraudulent communications. 
 
Initiatives in the United States—such as the News 
 
Literacy Project and the Trusted Journalism. 
 
A longer\-term and 
 
more insidious threat is to 
 
our understanding of what is 
 
true if we can no longer trust 
 
what we see and hear.

Continued 
Cyber Influence 
Operations
Program—are helping to develop better 
informed consumers of news and information. 
Globally, new technology like the browser plugin 
from NewsGuard can help move this effort 
forward much faster. 
This also should remind us that part of the 
foundation for democracy is an education in 
civics. As always, this effort needs to start in 
schools. But we live in a world that requires we 
receive ongoing civics education throughout 
our lifetime. The new Civics at Work pledge, led 
by the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies, and of which Microsoft was an inaugural 
signatory and partner, seeks to reinvigorate civics 
literacy within corporate communities. It is a 
good example of the breadth of opportunity 
to strengthen our democratic defenses. 
Disrupt 
In recent years, Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit 
(DCU) has refined tactics and developed tools to 
disrupt cyber threats ranging from ransomware 
to botnets and nation state attacks. We have 
learned many critical lessons, starting with the 
role of active disruption in countering a broad 
range of cyberattacks. 
As we think about countering cyber influence 
operations, disruption might play an even 
more important role and the best approach to 
disruption is becoming clearer. The most effective 
antidote to broad deception is transparency. 
That is why Microsoft increased its capacity 
to detect and disrupt nation state influence 
operations by acquiring Miburo Solutions, 
a leading cyber threat analysis and research 
company specializing in the detection of and 
response to foreign cyber influence operations. 
Our experience has shown that governments, 
technology companies, and NGOs should 
attribute cyberattacks carefully and with ample 
evidence. Understanding the impact of such 
disruption is vital and can be even more helpful 
in disrupting cyber influence. Witness the 
US government’s information\-sharing in the 
lead\-up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that 
put transparency into effective action—such 
as exposing Russian plans including specific 
campaigns like a plot to use a fake graphic video. 
As shown in last summer’s publication from 
the CyberPeace Institute in Geneva on ongoing 
cyberattacks inside and outside Ukraine, there 
is an opportunity for a broad range of civil 
society and private\-sector organizations to 
advance transparency relating to cyber influence 
operations. Reliable reports about newly 
discovered and well\-documented operations 
can help the public better evaluate what it 
reads, sees, and hears, especially on the internet. 
To this end, Microsoft will build on and extend 
its existing cyber reports and will release new 
reports, data, and updates related to what we 
discover about cyber influence operations, 
including attribution statements when 
appropriate. We will publish an annual report that 
uses a data\-driven approach to look across the 
company at the prevalence of foreign information 
operations and next steps to ensure incremental 
improvement. We will also consider additional 
steps that build on this type of transparency. 
The role of digital advertising is especially 
important, for instance, since advertising can help 
fund foreign operations while simultaneously 
creating an appearance of legitimacy for foreign\-
sponsored propaganda sites. New efforts will be 
needed to disrupt these financial flows. 
Deter 
Finally, we cannot expect nations to change 
behavior if there is no accountability for violating 
international rules. Enforcing such accountability 
is uniquely a governmental responsibility. 
Yet increasingly, multistakeholder action is 
playing an important role in strengthening and 
extending international norms. More than 30 
online platforms, advertisers, and publishers— 
including Microsoft—signed on to the recently 
updated European Commission’s Code of Practice 
on Disinformation, agreeing to strengthened 
commitments to tackle this growing challenge. 
Like the recent Paris Call, Christchurch Call, 
and Declaration on the Future of the Internet, 
multilateral and multistakeholder action can 
bring together the governments and public 
among democratic nations. Governments can 
then build on these norms and laws to advance 
the accountability the world’s democracies need 
and deserve. 
Through rapid radical transparency, democratic 
 
governments and societies can effectively blunt 
 
influence campaigns by attributing the source 
 
of nation state attacks, informing the public, 
 
and building trust in institutions. 
We have increased technical capacity 
 
to detect and disrupt foreign influence 
 
operations and are committed to 
 
transparently reporting on these 
 
operations like our reporting 
 
on cyberattacks. 
Actionable insights
 
1 
Implement strong digital hygiene 
 
practices across your organization.
 
2 
Consider ways to reduce any unintended 
 
enabling of cyber influence campaigns by 
 
your employees or your business practices. 
 
This includes reducing supply to known 
 
foreign propaganda sites.
 
3 
Support information literacy and civic 
 
engagement campaigns as a key 
 
component to help societies defend 
 
against propaganda and foreign influence.
 
4 
Engage directly with groups relevant 
 
to your industry working to address 
 
influence 
 operations.

Introduction 
 
The pandemic challenged us 
 
to pivot our security practices 
 
and technologies to protect 
 
Microsoft’s employees 
 
wherever they work. This 
 
past year, threat actors 
 
continued to take advantage 
 
of vulnerabilities exposed 
 
during the pandemic and 
 
the shift to a hybrid work 
 
environment. Since then, our 
 
principal challenge has been 
 
managing the prevalence and 
 
complexity of various attack 
 
methods and increased nation 
 
state activity. 
 
Digital threat activity and the level of cyberattack 
 
sophistication increases every day. Many of 
 
today’s complex attacks focus on compromising 
 
identity architectures, supply chains, and third 
 
parties with varying degrees of security controls. 
 
In particular, we have observed identity phishing 
 
attacks are a clear and present threat. However, 
 
these types of attacks are generally unsuccessful 
 
with good identity management, phishing 
 
control, and endpoint management practices. 
 
As a result, we must remember the basics: ninety 
\-
eight percent of attacks can be stopped with 
 
basic hygiene measures in place. At Microsoft, 
 
we manage identities and devices as part of 
 
our Zero Trust approach, which includes least 
 
privileged access and phish resistant credentials 
 
to effectively stop threat actors and keep our 
 
data protected. 
Today, even threat actors who lack sophisticated 
 
technical skills can launch incredibly destructive 
 
attacks, as access to advanced tactics, 
 
techniques, and procedures become broadly 
 
available in the cybercrime economy. The war 
 
in Ukraine demonstrated how nation state 
 
actors have escalated their offensive cyber 
 
operations through the increased use of 
 
ransomware. Ransomware is now a sophisticated 
 
industry with threat actors using double or 
 
triple extortion tactics to extract a pay out and 
 
developers offering ransomware as a service 
 
(RaaS). With RaaS, threat actors utilize an affiliate 
 
network to carry out attacks, lowering the barrier 
 
to entry for less skilled cybercriminals and, 
 
ultimately, expanding the attacker pool. 
 
As a result, Microsoft designed a ransomware 
 
elimination program. The goal of the program 
 
is to remediate gaps in controls and coverage, 
 
contribute to feature enhancements for services, 
 
and develop recovery playbooks for our security 
 
operations center and engineering teams in the 
 
event of a ransomware attack. 
 
Recent supply chain and third\-party supplier 
 
attacks indicate a major inflection point in the 
 
industry. The disruption these attacks cause 
 
for our customers, partners, governments, and 
 
Microsoft continues to increase, illustrating 
 
the importance of focused attention on cyber 
 
resiliency and collaboration across security 
 
stakeholders. Adversaries are also targeting 
 
on 
\-premises systems, reinforcing the need for 
 
organizations to manage vulnerabilities posed 
 
with legacy systems by modernizing and moving 
 
infrastructure to the cloud where security is 
 
more 
 robust. 
We live in an era where security is a key enabler 
 
of technological success. Innovation and 
 
enhanced productivity can only be achieved 
 
by introducing security measures that make 
 
organizations as resilient as possible against 
 
modern attacks. As digital threats increase and 
 
evolve, it’s crucial to build cyber resilience into 
 
the fabric of every organization.

Cyber resiliency: 
A crucial foundation 
of a connected society 
The revolution in digital technology has 
 
seen organizations transform to become 
 
ever more connected in both the way 
 
they operate and the services they offer. 
 
As threats in the cyber landscape increase, 
 
building cyber resilience into the fabric of 
 
the organization is as crucial as financial 
 
and operational resilience. 
Digital transformation has forever altered the 
 
way organizations interact with customers, 
 
partners, employees, and other stakeholders. 
 
New technologies provide huge opportunities 
 
to engage with people, transform products, and 
 
optimize operations. The pandemic accelerated 
 
the digital transformation by driving innovative 
 
technologies which allow people to collaborate 
 
in new ways and from any location. 
As cyber threats become endemic, preventing 
 
them from compromising an organization 
 
becomes more difficult in our “always connected” 
 
world. Cyber resiliency represents an organization’s 
 
ability to continue operations and sustain growth 
 
acceleration despite the barrage of attacks. 
 
Prevention must be balanced with survival and 
 
recovery capabilities and governments and enterprises 
 
are developing comprehensive models that extend 
 
beyond security and privacy to protect assets, data, 
 
and other resources as part of cyber resiliency. 
Developing a holistic approach 
 
to cyber resiliency 
Cyber resiliency requires a holistic, adaptive, and 
 
global 
 approach 
 that 
 can 
 withstand 
 evolving 
 threats 
 
to core services and infrastructure, including: 
• Basic cyber hygiene as described in our 
 
cyber resilience bell 
 curve. 
• Understanding and managing the risk/reward 
 
trade\-off of digital transformation. 
• Real\-time response capabilities that enable 
 
proactive detection of threats and vulnerabilities. 
• Protection against known attacks and 
 
preventive activity against new and 
 
anticipated attack vectors, including 
 
ability to automatically remediate. 
• Reduced impact of attacks and disasters 
 
through fault isolation and segmentation. 
• Automated recovery and redundancy in the 
 
event of disruption. 
• Prioritizing operational testing to find gaps 
 
and understanding shared responsibilities and 
 
dependencies on external resources such as 
 
cloud\-based 
 security 
 solutions. 
An effective cyber resiliency program begins with 
 
resource fundamentals such as understanding 
 
services available and having a reliable catalog 
 
of resources that can be called upon in the event 
 
of a disruption. Building on that foundation, 
 
the program must be able to assess its own 
 
effectiveness, measure the performance of critical 
 
services and their dependencies, test and validate 
 
capabilities across on\-premises and cloud 
 
services, and feed continuous improvement 
 
across 
 the 
 organization’s 
 digital 
 lifecycle. 
To deliver a holistic approach, we are partnering 
 
with organizations to identify their most critical 
 
on\-premises and online services, business 
 
processes, dependencies, personnel, vendors 
 
and suppliers. We also look to identify assets 
 
and resources associated with customer and 
 
market expectations, regulatory and contractual 
 
obligations, and internal operations. As these 
 
critical resources are identified, parallel efforts 
 
should detect and monitor threats, disruptions, 
 
potential attack vectors, and system and 
 
process vulnerabilities. The ability to do this 
 
under the current skills shortage requires rigor 
 
in prioritization based on overall risk posed to 
 
the 
 organization. 
This type of holistic approach needs to be 
 
adaptive against a backdrop of a continually 
 
evolving threat landscape, with a goal of driving 
 
measurable performance enhancement, reduced 
 
time to detect, respond and recover, and reduced 
 
radius of impact in the event of disruption. 
 
The approach must also recognize the increasing 
 
connectedness of threats. For example, a security 
 
incident might result in a data breach with 
 
privacy implications, requiring many internal 
 
and external teams to work together to respond 
 
quickly and minimize impact. 
Cyber resiliency is the ability of an 
 
enterprise to continue operations and 
 
sustain growth acceleration despite 
 
disruptions, including cyberattacks. 
Actionable insights
 
1 
Build and manage technology systems 
 
that limit the impact of a breach and 
 
enable them to continue to operate 
 
securely and effectively, even if a breach 
 
is successful. Focus on common critical 
 
assets, support for agility, and architect 
 
for adaptability (for example, hybrid and 
 
multi\-
 cloud, multi\-
 platform), reduce attack 
 
surfaces (for example, remove unused 
 
applications and over 
\-provisioned access 
 
rights), assume compromised resources, 
 
and expect adversaries to evolve.
 
2 
When planning digital projects, consider 
 
potential threats alongside opportunities, 
 
and shared responsibilities for resilience 
 
across the digital technology supply chain, 
 
including cloud\-
 based security solutions.
 
3 
Build systems to embed security by design 
 
and take steps to anticipate, detect, 
 
withstand, adapt, and respond to future 
 
evolving threats.
 
4 
Ensure business leaders consult 
 
with security teams as necessary to 
 
understand the risks associated with new 
 
developments. Likewise, security teams 
 
should consider business aims and advise 
 
leaders on how to pursue them securely.
 
5 
Ensure clear operational practices and 
 
procedures for organizational resilience 
 
are in place for cyber incidents.

The importance of 
modernizing systems 
and architecture 
 
 
As we develop new capabilities for a 
 
hyperconnected world, we must manage 
 
the threats posed by legacy systems 
 
and software. 
 
Legacy systems—those developed before 
 
modern connectivity tools such as smartphones, 
 
tablets, and cloud services became the norm\-
represent a risk to an organization still using 
 
them. This risk exposure is reinforced by the 
 
findings of the Microsoft Security Services for 
 
Incident Response team, a group of security 
 
professionals that helps customers respond 
 
to and recover from attacks. 
Over the past year, issues found among 
 
customers recovering from attacks were related 
 
to six categories as shown in the chart on this 
 
page. The following page outlines actionable 
 
steps to take for improved resilience. 
Over 80 percent of security incidents 
 
can be traced to a few missing 
 
elements that could be addressed 
 
through modern security approaches. 
Key issues impacting cyber resiliency 
This chart shows the percentage of impacted customers missing basic security controls which are critical to 
 
increasing organizational cyber resilience. Findings are based on Microsoft engagements over the past year. 
“Leaders should think about cyber 
 
resilience as a critical facet of business 
 
resilience. They should plan for cyber 
 
disruptions in the same way they do natural 
 
disasters or other unforeseen events and 
 
bring together internal stakeholders like 
 
operations, communications, legal, and more, 
 
to craft strategies. Doing so will help ensure 
 
organizations bring their critical business 
 
systems back online as quickly as possible 
 
to resume normal business operations. 
But it doesn’t stop there. As many 
 
organizations rely on third 
\-party suppliers 
 
and service providers, leaders should extend 
 
cyber resilience planning to their end 
\-to 
\-
end value chain to further ensure business 
 
continuity and resilience.”

There are clear areas which organizations can address to modernize their approach and protect from threats: 
Problem 
Actionable steps 
Insecure configuration of identity provider 
Misconfiguration and exposure of identity platforms and its components 
 
are a common vector for gaining unauthorized high privilege access. 
Follow security configuration baselines and best practices when deploying 
 
and maintaining identity systems such as AD and Azure AD infrastructure. 
Implement access restrictions by enforcing segregation of privileges, 
 
least privilege access and utilizing privileged access workstations (PAW) 
 
for managing identity systems. 
Insufficient privilege access and lateral movement controls 
Administrators have excessive permissions across the digital environment 
 
and often expose administrative credentials on workstations subject to 
 
internet and productivity risks. 
Secure and limit administrative access to make the environment 
 
more resilient and limit the scope of an attack. Employ Privilege 
 
Access Management controls such as just in time access and just 
 
enough 
 administration. 
No multifactor authentication (MFA) 
Today’s attackers do not break in, they log on. 
MFA is a critical and fundamental user access control that all organizations 
 
should enable. Coupled with conditional access, MFA can be invaluable in 
 
fighting cyber threats. 
Low maturity security operations 
Most impacted organizations used traditional threat detection tools and 
 
did not have relevant insights for timely response and remediation. 
A comprehensive threat detection strategy requires investments in 
 
extended detection and response (XDR) and modern cloud native 
 
tools employing machine learning to separate noise from signals. 
 
Modernize security operations tools by incorporating XDR that can 
 
provide deep security insights across the digital landscape. 
Lack of information protection control 
Organizations continue to struggle to put together holistic information 
 
protection controls that have full coverage across data locations and 
 
remain effective throughout the information lifecycle and are aligned 
 
with business criticality of data. 
Identify your critical business data and where it is located. 
 
Review information lifecycle processes and enforce data protection 
 
while ensuring business continuity. 
Limited adoption of modern security frameworks 
Identity is the new security perimeter, enabling access to disparate digital 
 
services and computing environments. Integrating Zero trust principles, 
 
application security and other modern cyber frameworks enables 
 
organizations to proactively manage risks which otherwise organizations 
 
might struggle to envision. 
Zero Trust frameworks enforce concepts of least privilege, 
 
explicit verification of all access, and always assume compromise. 
 
Organizations should also implement security controls and practices 
 
in DevOps and application lifecycle processes for higher assurance levels 
 
in their business systems.

Basic security posture 
is a determining factor 
in advanced solution 
effectiveness 
 
 
 
 
Through our analysis, we discovered a 
 
prevalence of common blind spots in 
 
organizational defenses which enable 
 
attackers to gain initial access, establish 
 
a toehold, and implement an attack, 
 
even in the presence of advanced 
 
security solutions. 
In many cases, the outcome of a cyberattack 
 
is determined long before the attack begins. 
 
Attackers leverage vulnerable environments 
 
to gain initial access, conduct surveillance, and 
 
wreak havoc via lateral movement and encryption 
 
or exfiltration. Stopping an attacker at an early 
 
stage greatly increases the opportunity to reduce 
 
the overall impact. 
 
Microsoft studied specific configurations in 
 
security postures to identify the most common 
 
shortcomings in actual practice in these 
 
environments. This enabled us to see the most 
 
common vulnerabilities exploited during human 
 
operated ransomware attacks that allowed the 
 
threat actors to gain access and travel through 
 
a network undetected. 
Basic security configurations must be turned on 
An organization’s devices which are not 
 
onboarded or are outdated (both in relation 
 
to vulnerabilities and security agent status) 
 
serve as potential entry points and access 
 
establishment routes for attackers. We found 
 
that while ensuring organizational devices are 
 
onboarded with an updated endpoint detection 
 
and response Note 1 (EDR) and endpoint protection 
 
platform Note 2 (EPP) solution is an important step, 
 
it is not guaranteed to stop ransomware. 
Advanced solutions such as EDR and EPP 
 
are critical in detecting an attacker early 
 
in the attack flow and enabling automatic 
 
remediation and protection. However, 
 
since these advanced solutions rely on a 
 
fundamental ability to detect an attack, they 
 
require basic security configurations to be 
 
turned on. In fact, we observed a prevalence 
 
of scenarios with advanced solutions in place 
 
that were undermined by the absence of basic 
 
security 
 configurations. 
Best practices in security configurations is a 
greater indicator of resilience than security 
operations center (SOC) analyst response time 
 
 
We observed a 70 percent reduction in the 
 
time it takes a SOC analyst to view and act 
 
on a relevant alert over a six\-month period 
 
across our customer and partner population. 
 
This increased awareness is a good sign. 
 
However, while security configuration visibility 
 
improved SOC analyst performance, enabling 
 
product visibility by onboarding and updating 
 
the organization’s devices was a greater predictor 
 
of successful prevention. 
Risk posed by unknown devices 
In contrast to cloud networks, where customers 
 
know which assets are running on which 
 
operating systems, on\-premises networks can 
 
contain a wide variety of devices such as IoT, 
 
desktops, servers, and network devices that are 
 
not monitored or managed by the organization. 
 
The average enterprise network has over 3,500 
 
connected devices that are not protected 
 
by an EDR agent and might have access to 
 
enterprise resources or even to high value assets. 
 
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) uses 
 
network inspection to discover devices and 
 
provide information about device classifications 
 
for those connected to the network such as 
 
device name, operating system distribution, 
 
and device type. 
 
3,500 
average number of 
connected devices in 
an enterprise that are 
not protected by an 
endpoint detection 
and response agent. 
For devices not supported by an EDR agent, 
 
at least be aware of their existence and act 
 
to protect them by assessing vulnerabilities, 
 
as well as restricting network access. 
 
Actionable insights
 
1 
Even advanced solutions can be 
 
undermined by the absence of basic 
 
security 
 configurations.
 
2 
Invest in best practices in security posture 
 
configurations to protect against future 
 
attacks. These basic settings produce a 
 
massive return on investment in terms 
 
of an organization’s ability to defend 
 
against attacks.
 
3 
Onboard all applicable devices to an 
 
EDR 
 solution.
 
4 
Be sure to update security agents and 
 
ensure protection from tampering 
 
to enable greater visibility and fuller 
 
protection benefits of products.

Safeguarding identity is more important 
 
than ever. While password\-based attacks 
 
remain the main source of identity 
 
compromise, other types of attacks are 
 
emerging. The volume of sophisticated 
 
attacks continues to increase relative 
 
to the previous norm of password spray 
 
and breach replay. 
Password\-based attacks are still common, and 
over 90 percent of accounts compromised via 
these methods are not protected with strong 
authentication. Strong authentication uses more 
than one factor of authentication, for example 
password \+ SMS and FIDO2 security keys. 
We have seen a rise in targeted password 
spray attacks, with very large spikes in volume 
of attacker traffic spread across thousands of 
IP addresses. 
Users compromised by attack category 
Users compromised per month by attack category. Password spray attack volumes were highly volatile, as seen in the 
spikes in November 2021 and March 2022\. These spikes represent thousands of users and thousands of IP addresses

Strong authentication adoption 
 
 
On a positive note, we are seeing steady 
 
growth in adoption of strong authentication 
 
amongst the Azure Active Directory (Azure 
AD) enterprise customer base. For Azure AD, 
strong authentication monthly active users 
 
(MAU) grew from 19 percent to 26 percent in 
the last year, while strong authentication MAU 
 
for administrative accounts grew from 30 to 
 
approximately 33 percent. 
 
 
This trend is positive, but significant growth is 
still needed to reach majority coverage of strong 
 
authentication; customers not already using 
 
strong authentication in their environments 
 
should start the planning and deployment 
 
of strong authentication to protect their 
 
users. Note 3 While designing strong authentication 
 
deployment, passwordless authentication 
 
should be considered as it offers the most 
 
secure usable experience, eliminating the risk 
 
of 
 password attacks. 
Use of strong authentication 
(September 2019–May 2022\) 
While strong authentication usage has doubled 
 
since 2019, just 26 percent of users and 33 percent of 
 
administrators are using strong authentication. Source: 
Azure Active Directory. 
Steady rise in token replay attacks 
The share of other forms of attack increased 
 
in 2022\. We saw a rise in targeted attacks that 
specifically avoid password\-based authentication 
to reduce the chance of detection. These attacks 
leverage browser single sign\-on (SSO) cookies or 
refresh tokens obtained via malware, phishing, 
 
and other methods. In some cases, attackers 
choose infrastructure in locations near the 
 
geographic location of the targeted user to 
 
further reduce the chances of detection. We have 
seen a steady rise in token replay attacks, 
 
reaching over 40,000 detections per month in 
 
Azure AD Identity Protection. Token replay is the 
use of tokens that were issued to a legitimate 
 
user by an attacker that has possession of said 
 
tokens. Tokens are commonly obtained via 
malware, for example by exfiltrating the cookies 
from the user’s browser or through advanced 
 
phishing methods.

Extracting tokens 
More than malware, attackers need credentials 
 
to achieve their goals. In fact, 100 percent of all 
 
human operated ransomware attacks include 
 
stolen credentials. Many sophisticated intrusions 
 
include credentials purchased from the dark web, 
 
initially stolen from unsophisticated and broadly 
 
distributed credential theft malware. This class of 
 
malware has evolved to steal tokens, including 
 
session information and MFA claims. This means 
 
that infections on home systems, where users 
 
log in to corporate assets, can lead to serious 
 
incidents on corporate networks. 
Attackers can also extract tokens from victims’ 
 
devices through man\-in\-the\-middle attacks, 
 
in which the victim clicks a malicious link in a 
 
phishing email or instant message and is directed 
 
to a website that looks like the legitimate sign\-in 
 
page of the identity provider. In reality, it is a web 
 
service spun up by the attacker that relays and 
 
intercepts all traffic between the user and the 
 
identity provider. The attacker is able to intercept 
 
the username and password and also to relay 
 
MFA challenges; resulting tokens issued by the 
 
identity provider and intercepted by the attacker 
 
might contain MFA claims that can be used by 
 
the attacker to satisfy MFA requirements. 
Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps has detected 
 
an average of 895 such attacks per month since 
 
the beginning of 2022\. This form of attack can 
 
be prevented by using phish\-resistant factors of 
 
MFA, such as Certificate Based Authentication, 
Windows Hello for Business, or FIDO2 
 
security keys. 
 
Password\-based attacks are the 
 
primary method by which accounts 
 
are compromised. 
MFA fatigue 
Using the concept of “MFA fatigue,” attackers 
 
generate multiple requests for MFA to the 
 
victim’s device, hoping that the victim will accept 
 
the request either inadvertently or as a result of 
 
fatigue. This attack can be prevented by using 
 
modern authenticator apps such as Microsoft 
 
Authenticator combined with features such 
 
as number matching Note 4 and enabling additional 
 
context. Note 5 Azure AD Identity Protection estimated 
 
there are 30,000 MFA fatigue attacks per month. 
The share of sophisticated attacks 
 
continues to rise, underscoring the 
 
need for phish\-resistant factors of 
 
multifactor authentication.

Operating system 
default security settings 
With the continuously evolving security 
 
threat landscape, we see an increasing need 
 
for computer security configured by default 
to improve cyber resiliency. While operating 
 
system security is more urgent, complex, 
 
and business critical than ever before, it can 
 
be challenging to get right and manage. 
 
In the past, computer and device security 
 
included built\-in security features that the 
 
customer or IT professional was expected 
 
to configure to their own desired level. 
This approach is no longer adequate, as 
 
attackers are using more advanced tools in 
 
automation, cloud infrastructure, and remote 
 
access technologies to achieve their aims. It has 
become critical that all layers of security, from 
 
the chip to the cloud, are configured by default. 
Microsoft has evolved to configure Windows 
operating system security by default. Note 6 
Customers who embrace defense—in depth 
 
including a layered security posture, new 
 
security features, regular and consistent patching 
 
and updates, as well as security training and 
 
awareness to report phishing and other scams 
 
– can expect less malware. 
 
To simplify defense in depth, Windows 11 
 
has tightly integrated hardware and software 
 
protections turned on by default, including 
 
memory integrity, Secure Boot, and a Trusted 
 
Platform Module 2\.0\. Windows 10 users on 
 
capable hardware can also turn these features 
 
on in the Windows Settings app or in the 
 
BIOS menu. 
 
Older devices in general often do not have 
 
as strong an alignment between hardware 
 
security and software security techniques. 
For devices where security is not enabled by 
 
default, manually configure them in settings 
where 
 possible. Note 7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For devices where security is 
 
not enabled by default, Microsoft 
 
recommends manually configuring 
them in settings where possible. 
 
Be proactive about applying 
continuous operating system 
 
updates and security patches that 
help provide protection throughout 
the hardware and software lifecycle. 
Actionable insights
 
1 
Use a passwordless solution which 
 
binds sign 
\-on credentials in the Trusted 
 
Platform Module, specifically look for 
 
a passwordless solution that meets the 
 
Faster Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance 
industry 
 standard.
 Note 8
 
2 
Perform timely clean up of all unused and 
 
stale executables sitting on organizations’ 
 
devices.
 
3 
Protect advanced firmware attacks by 
enabling memory integrity, Secure Boot, 
 
and Trusted Platform Module 2\.0, if not 
 
enabled by default, which hardens boot 
 
using capabilities built into modern CPUs.
 
 
4 
Turn on data encryption and 
 
credential protection.
 
5 
Enable application and browser 
 
controls for enhanced protection from 
 
untrusted applications and other built\-in 
 
exploit 
 protections.
 
6 
Enable memory access protection to help 
 
protect against casual physical attacks 
 
such as someone plugging a malicious 
 
device into externally accessible ports.

Software supply 
 
chain centrality 
 
Attacks on third\-party apps, plugins, 
 
and extensions can erode customer trust 
 
in suppliers that play a central role in the 
 
supply ecosystem. Using network theory 
 
to look at software centrality helps 
 
illuminate the criticality of patching, 
 
especially for central apps. 
The Windows App Network of 18 million 
 
application executables is installed and used 
 
across five million organizations, providing a 
top\-level view of our software ecosystem. Of 
the 100,000 most used applications, 97 percent 
 
are produced by third\-party organizations whose 
 
updates and security patches are maintained by 
 
them. This illustrates two important traits of our 
commercial 
 application 
 ecosystem. 
 
 
 
 
First, there is centrality in the Windows commercial 
 
application ecosystem. Only the top 100,000 (of the 
18 million) applications are used on 1,000 or more 
devices. In other words, just over one half of 1 
percent of these applications have this kind of broad\-
reaching effect among the device ecosystem. 
 
 
 
 
Second, there is diversity in the manageability 
 
of those applications, where the top 10,000 
 
application suppliers manage the updates 
 
and security patches of these most used 
 
commercial applications. This demonstrates 
the interdependence a company has on a 
 
diverse set of software suppliers’ security, 
 
compliance, and management controls. 
Commercial penetration 
of most\-used applications 
 
The top applications are used by millions of organizations 
 
and tens of millions of devices. Because they are near 
 
ubiquitous, adversaries are on constant lookout to 
 
exploit vulnerabilities in these top applications, which 
 
can impact millions of devices in the user base. 
We observe millions of commercial devices still 
 
using vulnerable application versions many 
 
months after patch release or even years beyond 
 
the end of product support. For example, there 
are more than one million active Windows 
 
commercial devices running version of a PDF 
 
reader that has not been supported since 2017\. 
 
 
Old versions of applications which 
 
are unsupported remain in active 
 
use on millions of commercial devices. 
As a result, organizations are at risk 
 
of carrying vulnerabilities that will 
 
not be patched. 
 
 
For in\-support application versions, we see a 
 
plateauing of the speed of critical patch adoption, 
 
which is the opposite of the trend that will drive 
 
resiliency. Instead, the curve should show an 
exponential upwards adoption of patches month 
 
over month, to achieve the resiliency needed. 
 
Rate of critical patch deployment 
After examining a critical vulnerability that affected 134 
 
versions of a set of browsers, we found that 78 percent, 
 
or millions of devices, still used one of the affected 
 
versions nine months after the patch was released. 
We used the InterpretML Note 9 toolkit to identify 
 
characteristics correlated with organizations that 
 
are more likely to have devices with older app 
 
versions. The most important of these predictors 
included: low hours of engagement on devices; 
 
geographic areas such as Asia Pacific and Latin 
America; and industries such as automotive, 
 
chemicals, telecommunications, transport 
 
and logistics, health payors (claim handlers), 
and 
 insurance. 
 
 
 
Software resiliency maintenance 
 
should include regular disabling or 
 
uninstalling of unused applications. 
The security and compliance of an 
 
organization depends on its own 
 
efforts and on the efforts of its 
 
software suppliers. 
Actionable insights
 
1 
Perform timely updates to all applications 
 
and endpoints through your organization.
 
2 
Perform timely cleanup of all unused 
 
and stale executables sitting on 
 
organizations’ 
 devices.

Building resilience 
 
to emerging DDoS, 
web application, and 
 
network attacks 
 
 
Accelerated digital transformation has 
 
brought an end to the traditional network 
 
and security perimeter model. Moving to 
 
the cloud means enterprises must adopt 
 
cloud\-native network security to protect 
 
digital assets. 
Attack complexity, frequency, and 
volume continue to grow and are 
 
no longer limited to holiday seasons, 
 
indicating a shift toward year\-round 
 
attacks. This highlights the importance 
of ongoing protection beyond 
 
traditional peak traffic seasons. 
Distributed denial of 
service (DDoS) attacks 
Over the past year, the world experienced DDoS 
activity that was unprecedented in volume, 
complexity, and frequency. This DDoS explosion 
was driven by a substantial increase in nation 
state attacks and continued proliferation of low\-
cost DDoS\-for\-hire services. Microsoft mitigated 
an average of 1,955 attacks per day, a 40 percent 
increase from the prior year. Previously, the peak 
number of attacks normally occurred during the 
end\-of\-year holiday season. This year, however, 
the most recorded in a day was on August 10, 
2021\. This might indicate a shift toward year\-
round attacks and highlights the importance 
of ongoing protection beyond traditional peak 
traffic seasons. 
In November 2021, Microsoft thwarted a 
volumetric DDoS attack with a throughput of 3\.4 
terabits per second (Tbps) from approximately 
10,000 sources spanning multiple countries. 
Similar high volumetric attacks above 2\+Tbps 
were mitigated in 2022 highlighting that it’s not 
just the complexity, frequency of attacks that’s 
increasing, but also the volume (bandwidth) 
of attack. 
Attack duration 
Most attacks observed over this past year were 
short\-lived. Approximately 28 percent of the 
attacks lasted less than 10 minutes, 26 percent 
lasted 10–30 minutes and 14 percent lasted 
31–60 minutes. Thirty\-two percent of the attacks 
were more than an hour in duration.

DDoS attack vectors 
In the past year, the attack vectors commonly 
 
employed were User Datagram Protocol (UDP) 
reflection on port 80 using simple service 
discovery protocol (SSDP), connectionless 
lightweight directory access protocol (CLDAP), 
domain name system (DNS), and network time 
protocol (NTP) comprising one single peak. 
We also saw an increase in application layer 
 
DDoS attacks targeting websites, with 
 
16\.3 million peak RPS (requests per second) 
and 9\.89 Tbps peak traffic. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In 2022, Microsoft mitigated nearly 
 
2,000 DDoS attacks daily and thwarted 
 
the largest ever DDoS attack reported 
 
in history. 
DDoS attack vectors 
UDP Spoof flood attacks 55% 
Other 20% 
TCP Ack flood attacks 19% 
DNS amplification attack 6% 
UDP Spoof flood attack rose to the top vector in 
the first half of 2022, from 16 percent to 55 percent. 
TCP Ack flood attack decreased from 54 percent to 
19 percent. 
The gaming industry continues to be the top 
target of DDoS attacks, mostly from mutations of 
the Mirai botnet and low\-volume UDP protocol 
attacks. Since UDP is commonly used in gaming 
and streaming applications, an overwhelming 
majority of the attack vectors were UDP spoof 
floods, while a small portion were UDP reflection 
and amplification attacks. 
Geographic target regions 
Of the DDoS attacks detected over the past year, 
54 percent were conducted against targets in 
the United States, a trend that might partially 
be explained by the fact that most Azure and 
Microsoft customers are in the United States. 
We also saw a sharp uptick in attacks against 
India, from just 2 percent of all attacks in the 
second half of 2021 to 23 percent in first half of 
2022\. East Asia, Hong Kong in particular, remains 
a popular target at 8 percent. For Europe, we saw 
concentrations of attacks against Amsterdam, 
Vienna, Paris, and Frankfurt regions. 
DDoS attack destination 
United States 54% 
East Asia 8% 
Europe 6% 
South Korea 1% 
South East Asia 3% 
Japan 1% 
Brazil 1% 
United Kingdom 1% 
Australia 1% 
United Arab Emirates 1% 
India 23% 
We attribute the high volume of attacks in Asia to the 
region’s huge gaming footprint, especially in China, 
Japan, South Korea, and India. This footprint will continue 
to expand as increasing smartphone penetration drives 
the popularity of mobile gaming, suggesting this 
geographic target will only continue to grow. 
Web application exploits 
Web application firewall (WAF), in combination 
with DDoS protection, forms an integral part of 
defense\-in\-depth strategy for protecting web 
and application programming interface (API) 
assets. Microsoft observed upwards of 300 billion 
WAF rules triggered per month via Azure WAFs.

Building resilience 
to emerging DDoS, 
web application, and 
network attacks 
Continued 
Due to an increasing number of bots 
performing credential stuffing attacks, 
credit card fraud, cyber influence 
campaigns, and supply chain attacks, 
we expect to see a steady increase in 
bot attacks against web applications. 
Network intrusions: detection and prevention 
We observed a significant increase in network layer exploits, particularly 
malware, in 2022\. Azure Firewall intrusion detection and prevention system 
(IDPS) blocked more than 150 million connections in the month of June alone. 
IDPS Deny traffic reason

Analysis of IDPS alert and deny traffic shows the following approaches used by 
attackers. In the Deny traffic, we are seeing attackers using SSL to hide their activities 
and remote execution attacks are becoming more common. In the Alert traffic, 
we are seeing SMB/SMB2 protocols used to perform remote execution attacks.

Developing a balanced 
approach to data security 
and cyber resiliency 
The digital transformation has fueled a 
vast expansion of data assets and a rise 
in security, compliance, and privacy risks. 
Cyber resilient organizations must balance 
investments in data protection, compliance, 
and recovery capabilities and integrate 
these with specialized regulatory response 
processes to address distinct types 
of breaches. 
Data breaches are not a matter of if, but when. 
 
The IBM and Ponemon Institute’s “Cost of a Data 
 
Breach, 2021” study reports a global average data 
 
breach cost of $4\.24 million USD (up 10 percent 
 
from the previous year) and $9\.05 million USD in 
 
the United States. Compliance failures were found 
 
to be the top cost\-amplifying factor. Conversely, 
 
breach cost reductions were associated with best 
 
practices such as incident response (IR) planning, 
 
Zero Trust deployment maturity, security AI and 
 
automation, and use of encryption. 
Data breaches are inevitable. 
 
Organizations that take a balanced 
 
resilience approach will reduce 
 
the frequency, impact, and cost 
 
of 
 breaches. 
 
 
Data governance, security, compliance, 
and privacy are interdependent 
We have seen data gain prominence in recent 
 
years as a crucial value creation engine for 
 
organizations. At the same time, the rise 
 
of privacy regulations requiring both data 
 
governance and security have blurred the lines 
 
between risk roles. While newer C\-level roles 
 
such as the Chief Data Officer (CDO) or the Chief 
 
Privacy Officers (CPO) have a vested interest in 
 
security and compliance, the implementation 
 
and operationalization of data protection often 
 
relies on teams led by the Chief Information 
 
Officers (CIO) and/or Chief Information Security 
 
Officer (CISO). It is not a one\-way street, as 
 
data governance initiatives led by CDOs also 
 
have security benefits. As a result of this 
 
interconnectedness, IT, data governance, security, 
 
compliance, and privacy teams need to work 
 
ever more closely to achieve efficiency and 
 
manage risk. 
Unified data risk management platforms 
for the entire organization’s data estate 
is the future 
Aligning IT, data governance, security, 
 
compliance, and privacy management process 
 
is difficult in an environment of bespoke 
 
applications for each discipline and inconsistent 
 
coverage across the typical organization hybrid, 
 
multi\-cloud data sprawl. We believe that 
 
organizations need a single pane of glass to 
 
locate and know their data, protect their data, 
 
govern the access, usage, and lifecycle of data, 
 
and prevent data loss across the data estate. 
 
Working from the same data inventory and 
 
activity information facilitates cross\-team 
 
processes, yields a more comprehensive risk 
 
picture, and allows organizations to better 
 
prepare and streamline their response to 
 
a breach. 
Data inventory 
and activity

The “single pane of glass” should act as a prism. 
Teams that have a stake in data security, compliance, 
and privacy need different yet consistent views of 
the same data inventory and activity to come into 
alignment and collaborate. Data activity includes data 
access, modification, and movement events, which are 
a valuable part of the data security equation. 
Effective data governance, 
security, compliance, and privacy 
are interdependent and require 
cross\-team collaboration. 
Actionable insights
 
1 
Balance defense with recovery and 
minimize data breach impact by investing 
in compliance, data protection, and 
response capabilities.
 
2 
Develop and adopt processes and tools 
that cut across data risk silos and cover 
the full data estate.

Resilience to cyber 
influence 
 operations: 
 
The human dimension 
Over the last five years, advances in 
graphics and machine learning have 
introduced easy\-to\-use tools capable 
of quickly generating high\-quality, 
realistic content that can spread 
widely across the internet in seconds. 
When it comes to events reported via text, audio, 
and visual content, we have reached a point 
where neither humans nor algorithms can reliably 
distinguish fact from fiction. The proliferation 
of these tools and their outputs are casting 
doubt on the trustworthiness of all digital media, 
disrupting our understandings of local and 
world events. New forms of influence operations 
enabled by advances in technology have grave 
implications for democratic processes. Note 11 
Questions arise about what we can do to prepare 
for a more resilient future against these cyber 
influence operations. Technology is only one 
part of the puzzle. It’s going to take multiple 
efforts, including education aimed at media 
literacy, awareness, and vigilance, investments in 
quality journalism—with trusted reporters on the 
scene, locally, nationally, and internationally—
networks of sharing and alerting about influence 
operations, and new kinds of regulations that 
penalize malevolent actors who generate or 
manipulate digital media with an aim to deceive. 
We also recognize that restoring trust in 
digital content is an ambitious goal that will 
require diverse perspectives and participation. 
There is not one company, or institution, or 
government that can solve these threats on 
its own. Our superpower as humans is our 
ability to collaborate and cooperate. This is 
especially important now because it will require 
everyone—global governments, industries, 
academia, and especially news, social, and 
media organizations—working together for 
the betterment and health of our society.

Fortifying the human 
factor with skilling 
Addressing the human factor is a key 
component of any cybersecurity skilling 
strategy. According to a Kaspersky Human 
Factor in IT Security study, Note 12 46 percent 
of cybersecurity incidents involve careless 
or uniformed staff who inadvertently 
facilitate the attack. 
Microsoft’s Education and Awareness team in 
 
the Digital Security and Resilience organization 
 
is responsible for fortifying the human factor 
 
of cybersecurity by empowering employees to 
 
secure our own and our customers’ systems 
 
and data. Our goals are to: 
• Reduce risk to Microsoft and our customers 
by building a centralized enterprise\-
wide core security skill set across the 
employee population. 
• Fortify employee security knowledge 
through a multi\-phased training 
reinforcement approach to support desired 
behavior outcomes. 
• Foster culture change by making a security 
mindset an intrinsic part of Microsoft’s culture 
through annually required security training 
and events. 
• Promote a one\-stop centralized web resource 
for best practices, company policy information, 
and incident reporting for all things 
cybersecurity related. 
A targeted, centralized cybersecurity skilling 
 
program reaches every Microsoft employee 
 
at least once each year. Training offerings are 
 
optimized to support current cybersecurity 
 
initiatives and deliver measurable behavior 
 
outcomes. Microsoft’s Information Risk 
 
Management Council (IRMC) plays a key role 
 
in identifying important cybersecurity behavior 
 
change outcomes to be addressed by training. 
With all of our cybersecurity skilling programs, 
 
we measure the solution’s efficiency, 
 
effectiveness, and outcomes where possible. 
 
For example, our insider threat skilling offering 
 
has 95 percent training compliance, exceptional 
 
learner satisfaction, and has resulted in a 
 
significant increase in managers reporting 
 
possible insider threat cases via the company’s 
 
Report It Now tool. The program includes: 
Security 
 Foundations: Centralized, enterprise\-
wide cybersecurity awareness and compliance 
 
training which addresses core security and 
 
privacy practices. This highly anticipated training 
 
series employs an edutainment model to 
 
make learning about cybersecurity engaging 
 
and 
 interesting. 
STRIKE: Microsoft’s required technical training 
 
for engineers who build and maintain line\-
of\-business solutions. This by\-invitation\-only 
 
training addresses timely and critical areas of 
 
cybersecurity hygiene best practice and uses a 
 
live hybrid delivery model tailored 
 
to audience needs. 
Program specific: Targeted training programs 
 
support specific cybersecurity initiatives including 
 
Shadow IT, Insider Threat, and Microsoft Federal. 
 
These offerings are tightly integrated into the 
 
overall engagement strategy for their respective 
 
cybersecurity initiatives through executive 
 
sponsorship and scorecard reporting to prevent 
 
a “check the box” training approach. 
MSProtect: Microsoft’s centralized web resource 
 
provides best practices, company policy 
 
information, and incident reporting for all things 
 
cybersecurity related. This on\-demand resource 
 
is the go\-to for employees outside of formal 
 
training 
 offerings. 
Security skilling must not be seen as 
a compliance, check\-the\-box activity. 
Instead, focus on behavior change 
to allow outcomes to be monitored 
across identified target behaviors, 
and establish listening systems to 
determine the impact of offerings. 
Actionable insights
 
1 
Provide security training and resources to 
 
employees when and where they need it.
 
2 
Develop a centralized skilling strategy 
 
informed by stakeholders from across 
 
the 
 enterprise.
 
3 
Ensure the impact of training is tracked 
 
and analyzed for efficiency (quantity), 
 
effectiveness (quality), and outcomes 
 
(business impact).

Insights from 
our ransomware 
elimination program 
Microsoft has been on its own Zero Trust 
journey Note 13 in the past five years to ensure 
identities and devices are robustly managed 
and healthy. As the risk of ransomware 
grows, we have developed a deep view 
to support our approach to protecting 
ourselves and our customers. 
Following an in\-depth internal evaluation, 
we built a ransomware elimination program 
to remediate gaps in controls and coverage, 
contribute to feature enhancements for services 
like Defender for Endpoint, Azure, and M365, 
and to develop playbooks for our SOC and 
engineering teams on how to recover in the 
event of a ransomware attack. 
The first step was understanding the extent of 
our protection against a ransomware attack 
directed at Microsoft. Efforts were already well 
underway to deploy Defender for Endpoint 
and to ensure all devices are managed and 
compliant with our Zero Trust policies, but we 
needed to find a way to understand all facets 
of the bigger question as to whether we could 
effectively recover from an attack. To gain insight, 
we evaluated the NIST 8374: Ransomware Risk 
Management: A Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 
Profile, Note 14 which aligns with our overall enterprise 
policy against our known list of controls. 
This analysis quickly identified gaps in coverage. 
Next, we prioritized gaps across the Identify, 
 
Detect, Protect, Respond, and Recover functions 
 
of the CSF. We found strategic alignment 
 
to Zero Trust and other programs and also 
 
discovered gaps that had no existing workstream. 
 
Having assessed the amount of work and effort 
 
needed to remediate these gaps, we separated 
 
them into two pillars: 
• Protect the enterprise (PtE): Define work 
items that we need to do as an enterprise to 
protect ourselves and be able to recover from 
an attack, should one be successful. 
• Protect the customer (PtC): Build capabilities 
into our offerings to protect our customers as 
well as our business. 
Embedding findings into our own enterprise 
To remediate the top risks and protect our 
critical services against a ransomware attack, 
we plan to focus investments over the next 6 to 
12 months on achieving the five scenarios below 
as part of a dedicated ransomware program. 
Once we succeed in each of the scenarios, we will 
gradually expand the scope of the program to 
reach all parts of the enterprise. 
Scenario 1: Security team members understand 
the overall risk associated with a ransomware 
attack and have a process established to provide 
awareness to the executives on control gaps and 
risk status. 
Scenario 2: Security team members have access 
to playbooks designed to help them and other 
teams within Microsoft respond to and recover 
critical services from a ransomware attack. 
Scenario 3: Enterprise Resilience team members 
have a standard to follow for the backup of 
critical systems. Playbooks exist and regular 
exercises of backup and recovery are done to 
ensure data can be recovered in the event of a 
ransomware attack. 
Scenario 4: Service owners understand and 
implement the required security and operational 
controls and policies to protect their service, 
customer data, endpoints and network assets 
against ransomware attacks with special focus on 
services prioritized as Microsoft critical services. 
Scenario 5: All employees can access educational 
and training resources which describe how to 
recognize a ransomware attack and how to notify 
the security team and initiate the response. 
Actionable insights
 
1 
Document and validate end\-to\-end 
recovery and remediation activities 
 
related to ransomware attacks against 
 
critical services.
 
2 
Involve stakeholders in updating your 
 
Enterprise Crisis Management playbooks 
 
to include ransomware specific activities 
 
and a decision process and guidance to 
 
determine if/when to pay for ransomware.
 
3 
Improve detection and protection 
 
coverage by enabling capabilities available 
 
in your deployed security products (e.g. 
 
Defender for Endpoint Attack Surface 
 
Reduction 
 rules).
 
4 
Work with the security standards team to 
 
define a baseline for protection against a 
 
ransomware attack, and provide training 
 
and documentation to engineering 
 
teams on how to protect against a 
 
ransomware attack.
 
5 
Put automation in place to make the 
 
deployment of security and operations 
 
policies easier on the DevOps teams 
 
and ensure that if a system drifts 
 
from compliance it is quickly flagged 
 
and remediated.

 Act now on quantum 
 security implications 
 
The pressure is on to manage the threat 
quantum computing poses to today’s 
cryptography and everything it protects. 
The recently issued Memorandum on 
Improving the Cybersecurity of National 
Security Department of Defense and 
Intelligence Community Systems Note 15 
builds on US Executive Order 10428 Note 16 
for Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity 
highlights software supply chain security 
as critical to addressing future nation\-
state attacks. 
What are quantum computers? 
Quantum computers are machines using the 
properties of quantum physics to store data and 
perform computations. This can be extremely 
advantageous for certain tasks where they could 
vastly outperform even our best supercomputers. 
Quantum computing is already opening new 
horizons for data encryption and processing. 
Studies predict quantum computing will become 
a multi\-billion dollar (USD) quantum industry as 
early as 2030\. Note 17 In fact, quantum computing and 
quantum communication are poised to have 
a transformative 
 effect 
 across a multitude of 
industries, ranging from healthcare and energy 
to finance and security. 
Quantum computing is a threat to today’s 
cryptography and everything it protects. 
The threat to today’s cryptography 
With Shor’s 1994 algorithm and an industrial\-
scale quantum computer of more than a few 
 
million physical qubits, all our current, widely 
 
deployed public\-key cryptographic algorithms 
 
could be efficiently broken. It is critical to 
 
consider, evaluate, and standardize “quantum\-
safe” cryptosystems that are efficient, agile, 
 
and safe against an adversarial quantum\-based 
 
attack. Software migration to “post\-quantum 
 
cryptography,” namely existing classical 
 
algorithms and protocols robust to quantum 
 
attack, will take years—if not a decade or more—
to achieve. Note 18 
This means the pressure is on to manage the 
 
threat to today’s cryptography and everything 
 
it protects. Adversaries can record encrypted 
 
data now and exploit it later once a quantum 
 
computer is available. Waiting for quantum 
 
computing to arrive before addressing its 
 
cryptographic implications will be too late. 
As cryptography is used throughout the cyber 
 
ecosystem, this means our cryptography\-
based security services could be compromised. 
 
For example, this includes services for 
 
communications (TLS, IPSec), messaging 
 
(email, web conferencing), identity and access 
 
management, web browsing, code signing, 
 
payment transaction and other services that are 
 
dependent upon cryptography for protection. 
As quantum computers become a reality, 
 
third\-party software components containing 
 
implementations of cryptographic algorithms 
 
and capabilities will require additional scrutiny 
 
as well. This requires all organizations along the 
 
value chain to do their part to ensure the chain 
 
stays secure. Industry bodies and governments 
 
are increasing efforts to define software supply 
 
chain security requirements and, in some cases, 
 
introducing new mandates for securing the 
chain. National Security Memorandum NSM\-8 Note 19 
establishes requirements and timelines for 
 
implementing post\-quantum cryptography 
 
in National Security Systems (NSS). It calls 
 
out timing expectations within 180 days for 
 
“modernization planning, use of unsupported 
 
encryption, approved mission unique protocols, 
 
quantum resistant protocols, and planning 
 
for use of quantum resistant cryptography 
 
where 
 necessary.” 
Standardization is a long lead\-time activity in 
 
the transition to quantum\-safe cryptography. 
 
Standards bodies that work on standards using 
 
public key cryptography must begin to experiment 
 
with and adapt to post\-quantum algorithms now. 
New post\-quantum cryptography (PQC) 
 
algorithms—classical algorithms thought to be 
 
robust to quantum attack—are now under review 
 
through NIST’s Post\-Quantum Standardization 
 
Project. Note 20 This work will influence global efforts 
within standards bodies. Although there will be 
 
some overlap with US government algorithm 
 
selections, differing national body/regulatory 
 
choices for compliant algorithms could present 
 
international challenges. This fragmentation will in 
 
turn complicate product and service engineering. 
New post\-quantum cryptography 
 
algorithms are under review through NIST’s 
 
Post\-Quantum Cryptography Standardization 
 
program. This work will influence global 
 
efforts within standards bodies. 
Actionable insights 
Alongside SAFECode and partnering members, 
 
immediate shorter\-term activities should be 
 
taken by industry to prepare for the PQC 
 
transition. Note 21 These include:
 
1 
 
Take an inventory of your products/codes 
 
that use cryptography.
 
2 
Implement a crypto agility strategy 
 
across your organization that includes 
 
minimizing the code churn required when 
 
cryptography 
 changes.
 
3 
Pilot the use of candidate quantum\-safe 
 
algorithms in your products or services 
 
that use cryptography. 
4 
Be prepared to use different public key 
 
algorithms for encryption, key exchange, 
 
and 
 signatures. 
5 
Test your applications for the impact of very 
 
large key sizes, ciphers, and signatures.

Integrating business, 
security, and IT for 
greater resilience 
Robust cyber resiliency depends on 
 
business leaders working with security 
 
teams to implement security. In Microsoft’s 
 
experience, security leadership is a 
 
challenging discipline that requires support 
 
from organizational leaders to most 
 
effectively protect the organization. 
 
Security leaders navigate a spectrum of dynamic 
 
challenges spanning topics related to risk, 
 
technology, economics, organizational process, 
 
business models, culture transformation, 
 
geopolitical interests, espionage, and 
 
international 
 sanctions 
 compliance. 
 Each 
 of 
 
these carries nuances to be understood and 
 
closely 
 managed. 
 
Security leaders are also tasked with thwarting 
 
both intelligent, well\-funded, and highly 
 
motivated human attackers, and low\-skilled, 
 
yet effective, cybercriminals. Their teams must 
 
defend complex technical estates often built 
 
up incrementally over 30 or more years when 
 
security was a low or nonexistent priority. 
 
Decisions made years ago can pose risks today 
 
until we pay off the technical debt and address 
 
the gaps in security. 
Organizational leaders and policymakers can 
 
have a significant positive impact on security by 
 
actively supporting security leaders and helping 
 
to build a bridge between integrated security 
 
and the rest of the organization. When Microsoft 
 
works with customers that have this alignment, 
 
we see them building a more resilient 
 
organization and also improving their agility 
 
to 
 adapt 
 and 
 innovate. 
 
Organizational leadership can support security 
leaders by focusing on three key areas: 
1\. Build security by design 
Security is sometimes viewed as an obstacle or 
 
an afterthought in business processes, often 
 
being considered in decisions only when it is too 
 
late to avoid a risk or fix cheaply and easily. 
Organizational leaders and policymakers should 
 
ensure that they: 
Include security early on new initiatives. 
 
New digital initiatives and cloud adoption should 
 
prioritize security to ensure organizational risk 
 
does not increase with each new application 
 
or digital capability. Once security is reliably 
 
included, you can use those processes to 
 
modernize legacy systems to get both security 
 
and productivity benefits at the same time. 
Normalize preventive maintenance for 
 
security. 
 Ensure basic security maintenance—
like applying security updates and patches and 
 
secure 
 configurations—has 
 full 
 organizational 
 
support allocated (including budgets, scheduled 
 
downtime, acquisition requirements for vendor 
 
product support). 
 
Unfortunately, many organizations delay, 
defer, or apply these common practices only 
partially. This provides extensive opportunities 
for attackers to exploit. The need for security 
normalization is captured in US NIST 800\-40\. Note 22
2\. Engage with security 
Organizational leaders should actively participate 
 
in and sponsor key security processes to ensure 
 
prioritization of resources and preparedness for 
 
security disasters. This includes engaging in: 
Identify critical business assets. 
 
Security leaders and teams need to know 
 
which assets are business\-critical to focus 
 
security resources on what matters most. This is 
 
often a new exercise that includes asking and 
 
answering new questions that have not been 
 
previously addressed. 
Cybersecurity business continuity and disaster 
 
recovery exercises. 
 Cyberattacks can become 
 
major events that disrupt or halt most or all 
 
business operations. Ensuring teams throughout 
 
the organization are prepared to handle these 
 
situations will reduce the time to restore business 
 
operations, limit damage to the organization, 
 
and help sustain the trust and confidence of 
 
customers, citizens, and constituents. This should 
 
be integrated within an existing business 
 
continuity and disaster recovery process. 
Security risk decisions are 
 
best made by business or 
 
mission owners who have 
 
full visibility across all risks 
 
and opportunities.

Continued 
3\. Position security correctly 
The way organizations structure security risk 
 
accountability often sets them up for poor 
 
security risk decision making. Risk decisions 
 
are best made by business or mission owners 
 
who have full visibility across all risks and 
 
opportunities, but organizations often (implicitly 
 
or explicitly) assign security risk accountability 
 
to subject matter experts in the security team 
 
instead. This places an unhealthy burden on 
 
security teams while depriving business owners 
 
of visibility and control over a key risk to their 
 
business. Organizations can correct this by: 
Preparing business owners: Educate business 
 
owners about security risk overall and how 
 
these threats can and will affect their business. 
 
Engaging security teams directly in this effort 
 
also increases the collaborative relationship with 
 
security and overall business agility. 
Assigning security risk to business owners: 
 
As business owners become informed enough 
 
to understand and accept security risk, the 
 
organization should explicitly shift accountability 
 
for security risk to them while still holding 
 
security teams responsible for managing that risk 
 
and providing informed expertise and guidance 
 
to the owner.

“Cyber resilience is on a sliding scale from 
 
classic business continuity and disaster recovery 
 
starting with good data backup; progressing to 
 
recovery capabilities for processes, technology, 
 
and their dependencies (including people and 
 
third parties); and moving to always on, self 
 
healing services, resilience for critical roles, and 
 
failovers for critical third parties. The most resilient 
 
organizations promote integration between IT, 
 
business managers, and security professionals. 
 
Great resilience includes designing for resilience 
 
from the start, having safe change management, 
 
and granular fault isolation. Cyber resilience is 
 
just one scenario in a good all\-hazards planning 
 
program. As cyber risks increase and the 
 
intersection between cybersecurity and resilience 
 
becomes more important, the connection of the 
 
Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to the 
 
enterprise resilience program grows stronger. 
 
Every year, more CISOs are taking ownership 
 
for company\-wide resilience.”

The cyber resilience 
bell curve 
Resilience success factors every organization 
should adopt 
As we have seen, many cyberattacks are 
successful simply because basic security hygiene 
has not been followed. The minimum standards 
every organization should adopt are: 
• Enable multifactor authentication (MFA): 
To protect against compromised user 
passwords and helps to provide extra 
resilience for identities. 
• Apply Zero Trust principles: The cornerstone 
of any resilience plan limiting the impact on an 
organization. These principles are: 
– Explicitly verify—ensure users and devices 
are in a good state before allowing access 
to resources. 
– Use least privilege access—only allow the 
privilege that is needed for access to a 
resource and no more. 
– Assume breach—assume system defenses 
have been breached and systems might 
be compromised. This means constantly 
monitoring the environment for 
possible attack. 
• Use extended detection and response 
anti\-malware: Implement software to 
detect and automatically block attacks and 
provide insights to the security operations. 
Monitoring insights from threat detection 
systems is essential to being able to respond 
to threats in a timely fashion. 
• Keep up to date: Unpatched and out of date 
systems are a key reason many organizations 
fall victim to an attack. Ensure all systems 
are kept up to date including firmware, the 
operating system and applications. 
• Protect data: Knowing your important 
data, where it is located and whether the 
right systems are implemented is crucial to 
implementing the appropriate protection.
