# Introduction
CyberEdge’s annual Cyberthreat Defense Report (CDR) plays a 
unique role in the IT security industry. Other surveys do a great 
job of collecting statistics on cyberattacks and data breaches 
and exploring the techniques of cybercriminals and other bad 
actors. Our mission is to provide deep insight into the minds of IT 
security professionals. 

Now in its ninth year, the CDR has become a staple among IT 
security leaders and practitioners by helping them gauge their 
internal practices and security investments against those of their 
counterparts across multiple countries and industries. If you 
want to know what your peers in IT security are thinking and 
doing, this is the place to look. 

CyberEdge would like to thank our Silver, Gold, and Platinum 
research sponsors, whose continued support is essential to the 
success of this report.

## Top Five Insights for 2022
As always, our latest CDR installment yields dozens of actionable 
insights. But the following are the top five takeaways from this 
year’s report:
1.  There has been no let-up in pressure on security teams. 
While the number of organizations that experienced a 
successful cyberattack dropped a touch from 86.2% in 
the previous survey to 85.3% in this one, the percentage 
victimized by six or more attacks increased to a new record 
of 40.7%. And the number of respondents who think it 
is somewhat or very likely that their organization will be 
successfully attacked in the coming year reached a new 
record of 76.1%.
2.  The biggest security issues for many organizations are 
a persistent shortfall of skilled IT security personnel 
and low security awareness among employees. These 
continue to top the list of factors that inhibit organizations 
from adequately defending themselves against cyberthreats 
(see page 24). We also see a lack of security skills across a 
wide range of job roles (page 15) and find user security 
awareness to be an area where our survey respondents 
doubt their organization’s capabilities (page 13).
3.  Among cyberthreats, ransomware and account takeover 
(ATO) attacks are poised to overtake malware as the #1 
concern. Malware is still perceived as the most important 
threat, but ATO and credential abuse attacks moved up from 
fourth place last year to #2 this year, and ransomware is only 
a tad behind. We think one or the other will take over the top 
spot in the next year or two (see page 17). 
4.  Pressure from ransomware rachets up once again. The 
percentage of organizations victimized by a ransomware 
attack in the past 12 months rose 2.5% to reach a new high 
of 71.0%. Ransom demands continued to rise, and the 
percentage of organizations deciding to pay jumped from 
57.0% to 62.9%, also a record. The data also points to a “sweet 
spot” for ransomware gangs: organizations with 5,000 to 
25,000 employees. These are being targeted more often than 
their smaller and larger counterparts because they can afford 
to pay high ransoms, yet disabling them does not typically 
disrupt local economies or shut down essential infrastructure 
and draw the attention of national governments and law 
enforcement agencies (see page 21).
5.  Security teams are getting a handle on the new norm 
created by COVID-19. After scrambling to adapt to the 
disruptions caused by the pandemic, they are now well 
along in deploying and managing technologies and 
processes to build security into web and mobile applications, 
make work from home (WFH) secure, and improve the 
security and economics of networking with cloud-based 
resources (see pages 50, 52, and 54, respectively).

## Survey Demographics
•	 Responses received from 1,200 qualified IT security 
decision makers and practitioners
•	 All from organizations with more than 500 employees
•	 Representing 17 countries across North America, 
Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, 
and Africa
•	 Representing 19 industries

# Introduction
## Cyberwar and the Russian Invasion of Ukraine
This report is being written during the early stages of Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine. Obviously, our survey results don’t reflect the 
impact of that event. However, in “The Road Ahead” section that 
begins on page 56, we offer some predictions about how the 
invasion may affect information security and the cybersecurity 
industry.

## About This Report
The CDR is the most geographically comprehensive, vendor-
agnostic study of IT security decision makers and practitioners. 
Rather than compiling cyberthreat statistics and assessing 
the damage caused by data breaches, the CDR surveys the 
perceptions of IT security professionals, gaining insights into 
how they see the world.

Specifically, the CDR examines:
- The frequency of successful cyberattacks in the prior year and 
optimism (or pessimism) about preventing further attacks in 
the coming year
- The perceived impact of cyberthreats and the challenges 
faced in mitigating their risks
- The adequacy of organizations’ security postures and their 
internal security practices
- The organizational factors that present the most significant 
barriers to establishing effective cyberthreat defenses
- The investments in security technologies already made and 
those planned for the coming year
- The health of IT security budgets and the portion of the 
overall IT budget they consume

By revealing these details, we hope to help IT security decision 
makers and practitioners gain a better understanding of how 
their perceptions, concerns, priorities, and defenses stack 
up against those of their peers around the world. IT security 
teams can use the data, analyses, and findings to answer many 
important questions, such as: 
- Where do we have gaps in our cyberthreat defenses relative 
to other organizations?
- Have we fallen behind in our defensive strategy to the point 
that our organization is now the “low-hanging fruit” (i.e., likely 
to be targeted more often due to its relative weaknesses)?
- Are we on track with both our approach and progress in 
continuing to address traditional areas of concern, while also 
tackling the challenges of emerging threats?
- How does our level of spending on IT security compare to 
that of other organizations?
- Do other IT security practitioners think differently from us 
about cyberthreats and their defenses, and should we adjust 
our perspective and plans to account for these differences?

Another important objective of the CDR is to provide developers 
of IT security technologies and services with information they 
can use to better align their solutions with the concerns and 
requirements of potential customers. Our data can lead to better 
market traction and success for solution providers, along with 
better cyberthreat protection technologies for all the intrepid 
defenders out there.

The findings of the CDR are divided into four sections:

### Section 1: Current Security Posture
Our journey into the world of cyberthreat defenses begins 
with respondents’ assessments of the effectiveness of their 
organization’s investments and strategies relative to the 
prevailing threat landscape. They report on the frequency of 
successful cyberattacks, judge their organization’s security 
posture in specific IT domains and security functions, and 
provide details on the IT security skills shortage. The data will 
help you begin to assess:
- Whether, to what extent, and how urgently changes are 
needed in your organization
- Specific countermeasures that should be added to 
supplement your existing defenses

### Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns
In this section, our exploration of cyberthreat defenses shifts 
from establishing baseline security postures to determining 
the types of cyberthreats and obstacles to security that most 
concern today’s organizations. The survey respondents weigh 
in on the most alarming cyberthreats, barriers to establishing 
effective defenses, and high-profile issues such as ransomware 
and cloud application security. We also look at how IT security 
training and professional certification can help enterprises 
address the serious shortfall in skilled IT security staff. These 
appraisals will help you think about how your organization can 
best improve your cyberthreat defenses going forward.

### Section 3: Current and Future Investments
Your organization can ill afford to stand still when it comes to 
maintaining effective cyberthreat defenses. Your IT security 
team must keep pace with changes occurring in business, 
technology, and threat landscapes. This section of the survey 
provides data on the direction of IT security budgets, and on 
current and planned investments in network security, endpoint 
security, application and data security, security management 
and operations, and identity and access management. You will 
be able to compare your organization’s investment decisions 
against the broad sample and get a sense of what “hot” 
technologies your peers are deploying.

### Section 4: Practices and Strategies
Mitigating today’s cyberthreat risks takes more than investing 
in the right technologies. You must ensure those technologies 
are deployed optimally, configured correctly, and monitored 
adequately to give your organization a fighting chance to avoid 
being a front-page news story. In the final section of the survey 
our respondents provide information on how they are deploying 
and using leading-edge technologies and services for tasks such 
as strengthening application security and protecting employees 
working from home.

# Research Highlights
## Current Security Posture
- Six+ cyberattacks becoming common. Last year, 85.3% of 
organizations experienced a successful cyberattack, while 
those experiencing 6+ attacks rose to a new high of 40.7% 
(page 7).
- No let-up seen. The number of respondents saying a 
successful attack is likely in the coming year reached a new 
record of 76.1% (page 9).
- SaaS apps well protected. Respondents have confidence in 
the security posture of SaaS companies, but not so much in 
their own mobile devices or APIs (page 11).
- Attack surface blues? Respondents have doubts about their 
organization’s ability to manage attack surfaces – and about 
user security awareness (page 13).
- Ongoing talent drought. 84.1% of organizations can’t find 
enough skilled security people. If you are one, ask for a raise 
(page 15)!

## Perceptions and Concerns
- New threats rising. ATO and ransomware attacks are closing 
in on malware as the cyberthreats of greatest concern (page 
17).
- PII and credentials at risk. Among web and mobile 
application attacks, PII harvesting and ATO are the most 
prevalent and concerning (page 19).
- Good and bad news on ransomware. Damage from 
ransomware continues to grow, but governments and law 
enforcement agencies are finally striking back (page 21).
- People problems persist. Yet again, the two biggest barriers 
to effective security are a lack of skilled personnel and 
employees’ low security awareness (page 24).
- Integrated defenses are good for you. Respondents cite 
multiple benefits of unified app and data security defenses 
(page 26).
- Hybrid cloud security challenges. Distributing apps 
across data centers and cloud platforms creates significant 
challenges for security teams (page 28).
- Cloud and software security education requested. 
Security professionals see certifications, especially in cloud 
and software security, as career boosters (page 30).

## Current and Future Investments
- Security spending solid. The percentage of overall IT 
budgets allocated to security held steady at a near-record 
12.7% (page 32).
- More for most. A strong 83.2% of organizations expect to 
see their IT security budget grow this year (page 34).
- Network security warhorses. Five security technologies are 
currently in use in at least 55% of organizations (page 36).
- Endpoint security basics. Basic anti-virus is ubiquitous on 
endpoints, and EDR, DLP
, and EPP are popular. Deception 
technology is an intriguing newcomer (page 38).
- Watch those APIs! Solutions to protect APIs are the leading 
application and data security technology, adopted in almost 
two-thirds of organizations (page 40).
- Must manage risk. In the area of security management, 
cyber risk management and reporting products are 
becoming essential (page 42).
- Identities at center stage. Last year, organizations increased 
their use of nine of the 10 identity and access management 
technologies we follow (page 44).
- MSSPs making friends. Because of staffing shortages, 
organizations are outsourcing more tasks to managed 
security service providers (page 46).

## Practices and Strategies
- Cloud security edging ahead. The percentage of security 
applications and services delivered via the cloud rose 0.5%, to 
41.1% (page 48).
- Baking security into the app. Organizations are embracing 
a range of technologies to enhance application security (page 
50).
- Safe at home. To protect work from home, organizations rely 
on old standbys like anti-virus solutions and VPNs and new 
approaches like SASE and ZTNA (page 52).
- Security in packets and hardware. Organizations are rapidly 
deploying SD-WAN technology and hardware-based security 
(page 54).

# Section 1: Current Security Posture
## Past Frequency of Successful Cyberattacks
A short summary of the cybersecurity landscape over the past 
year: gale-force winds continue. 

More than six out of seven organizations (85.3%) experienced 
a successful cyberattack within the last 12 months. That’s down 
a touch from the previous year’s record high of 86.2%, but 
still substantially larger than in any of the prior seven years of 
this survey. The number of organizations suffering six or more 
successful attacks set a new record of 40.7%. That contrasts with 
only 16.2% eight years ago (see Figures 1 and 2).

In the course of this report, we will explore many reasons why 
the pressure on IT security teams has remained so strong. 

![Figure 1: Frequency of successful cyberattacks in the last 12 months.]

It isn’t a matter of money: IT security budgets have continued 
to grow in most places, albeit at a slightly slower rate than in 
previous years (page 24). In fact, lack of budget ranks near the 
bottom of the list of factors that inhibit security teams from 
adequately defending against cyberthreats (page 24). 

However, the typical organization’s attack surface continues 
to expand, driven primarily by the effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Security teams must work hard to protect more 
employees working from home (page 52), protect more software 
in hybrid cloud environments (page 28), and build better security 
into web and mobile applications (page 19). At the same time, 
security teams are facing insidious new threats. Two of the 

![Figure 2: Percentages compromised by at least one successful attack 
and by six or more successful attacks.]

>“A short summary of the cybersecurity 
landscape over the past year: gale-force 
winds continue.”

blockbuster issues of the past year have been the increasing 
popularity (for cybercriminals) of double extortion ransomware, 
which not only encrypts data but also exfiltrates it to the web 
(where it can be published), and vulnerabilities in the Log4j 
utility from Apache, which could potentially affect 3 billion 
devices and applications.

And the pressure can’t be relieved by hiring, since the vast 
majority (84.1%) of organizations are already experiencing a 
shortfall in IT security personnel (page 15). 

But don’t give up hope. We will also review the technologies 
that organizations are planning to implement in areas such 
as network, endpoint, application, and identity security 
(pages 36-45) and how organizations can use security training 
and certifications to move junior security professionals into 
more-advanced roles (page 30).

Now, back to our data about successful cyberattacks in the past year. 
Of the seven major industries surveyed for this report, education 
was the most often victimized for the second year in a row 
(90.5%), followed closely by telecom and technology (90.3%). 
Not far behind were finance (88.2%), manufacturing (86.4%), and 
retail (85.6%). Healthcare (75.3%) and government (68.2%) were 
affected somewhat less often (see Figure 3). 

![Figure 3: Percentage compromised by at least one successful attack 
in the past 12 months, by industry.]

Looking globally, the countries with the highest percentage 
of organizations successfully attacked were Colombia (93.9%), 
Turkey (93.7%), Spain (91.8%), Mexico (90.6%), Canada (89.8%), 
and France (89.3%). The UK, Germany, and Australia were at the 
other end of the spectrum, with 81.4%, 72.6%, and 62.5% of 
their organizations being compromised, respectively (see Figure 
4). Maybe the Aussies know something. Not only was Australia 
the only country where less than 70% of organizations were 
breached at least once, but only 20.9% of the organizations 
there reported six or more successful attacks, about half of the 
international average. 

![Figure 4: Percentage compromised by at least one successful attack 
in the past 12 months, by country.]

## Future Likelihood of Successful Cyberattacks
What is the likelihood that your organization’s network will become compromised by a successful 
cyberattack in 2022? 

Expectations about successful cyberattacks over the coming 12 
months reached a new high in this year’s survey. The number of 
respondents indicating that such an attack was either “somewhat 
likely” or “very likely” edged up from 75.6% to 76.1%. In addition, 
the mix between those two views shifted for the worse. The 
percentage saying a successful attack was “very likely” jumped 
by 3.1%, to 35.1%. That is four times the number (8.5%) who 
gave that response eight years ago when this survey started (see 
Figure 5).

![Figure 5: Percentage indicating compromise is “more likely to occur 
than not” in the next 12 months.]

The best we can say is that the rate of increase in the combined 
total has slowed to half a percentage point in this survey, after 
having jumped 2.9%, 4.1%, and 6.3% in the 2019, 2020, and 2021 
CDRs, respectively. We think the curve has flattened because 
organizations have spent the last two years putting in place 
infrastructure and processes to protect remote operations, 
home-based workers, and personal devices (i.e., devices not 
managed by the IT department). Examples of such measures 
include bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies and zero trust 
network access (ZTNA) approaches to network and application 
access (see pages 52 and 54). Those investments are giving 
security teams greater confidence in their ability to manage the 
challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is interesting to note that the 76.1% of respondents indicating 
that a successful attack is somewhat or very likely in the 
coming 12 months is less than the 85.3% who experienced 
such an attack in the past year. In other words, at least some 
security professionals who were victimized last year think their 
organizations are better able to defend themselves this year. Or 
else they are just optimistic. A positive attitude is healthy, when 
not taken to extremes. Perhaps we should all follow the example 
of Benjamin Disraeli, the 19th century British prime minister, who 
said: “I am prepared for the worst, but hope for the best.”

>“Perhaps we should all follow the example of 
Benjamin Disraeli, the 19th century British prime 
minister, who said: ‘I am prepared for the worst, 
but hope for the best.’”

When we look at expectations by country, the highest number 
of respondents predicting successful cyberattacks were in Japan 
(87.9%), Canada (85.4%), and Singapore (84.0%). In the middle of 
the pack: the United States (79.7%), Spain (76.0%), and Germany 
(74.3%). The optimists were Colombia (60.7%), Brazil (55.9%), and 
Turkey (a mere 38.0%) (see Figure 6).

![Figure 6: Percentage indicating compromise is “more likely to occur 
than not” in the next 12 months, by country.]

By industry, respondents from finance are expecting the worst 
(86.7%), followed by those in education (84.1%), telecom and 
technology (79.1%), and healthcare (76.0%). Those in retail 
(70.4%) and manufacturing (68.9%) were more sanguine. 
And as on the previous question, security professionals in the 
government sector (54.3%) were least worried (see Figure 7). 

![Figure 7: Percentage indicating compromise is “more likely to occur 
than not” in the next 12 months, by industry.]

## Security Posture by IT Domain
On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate your organization’s overall security posture 
(ability to defend against cyberthreats) in each of the following IT components:

Each year we try to gauge how security professionals feel about 
their ability to defend against cyberthreats across different types 
of systems, technologies, and environments. This information 
gives us a picture of the IT domains where they are most 
confident, and those that are creating the most headaches (see 
Figure 8).

This year respondents chose software as a service (SaaS) cloud 
applications as the area where they are most comfortable about 
their organization’s security posture. SaaS moved up from third 
position in the previous two surveys. Clearly, SaaS vendors have 
done a good job of staying on top of security issues (or at least 
are perceived that way by their customers).

![Figure 8: Perceived security posture by IT domain.]

Respondents are also confident about physical and virtual 
servers, as well as datastores such as file servers, databases, and 
SANs. These are always at or near the top of the list because they 
are mostly located in data centers under the direct observation 
and control of operations and security staffs.

Laptops and notebooks joined the top tier, in fourth position, 
moving up from eighth in the previous survey. In fact, this area 
had the largest year-to-year increase in security posture ratings, 
from 4.01 last time (on a scale of 1 to 5) to 4.11 in this one. We 
believe this reflects all the attention and effort over the past 
two years that has gone into better protection for remote and 
home workers in response to COVID-19. On page 52 we discuss 
technologies and architectures that are enabling employees to 
securely work from home.

The IT domain that most concerns respondents is mobile devices 
such as smartphones and tablets. A big part of the problem is 
that COVID has increased the business use of mobile devices 
owned by employees. These cannot easily be updated, locked 
down, or even monitored by their employers, and are therefore 
less defended and more vulnerable to attacks. A multi-sponsor 
survey report published by CyberEdge in 2020, “The Impact of 
COVID-19 on Enterprise IT Security Teams Report,” showed a 
nearly 60% leap in the number of organizations implementing 
BYOD policies in response to the new pandemic reality. Clearly, 
IT security teams continue to be nervous about securing 
employee-owned mobile devices.

The next two greatest areas of concern are “manufacturing and 
operational technology (OT),” which includes categories such 
as industrial control system (ICS) and supervisory control and 
data acquisition (SCADA) systems, and devices that make up 
the emerging internet of things (IoT). These are areas with large 
numbers of devices that were never designed with security 
in mind. They are also being targeted by state-sponsored and 
criminal hacking groups, with a few well-publicized incidents 
related to international conflicts and blackmail. 

>“Laptops and notebooks joined the top tier, 
in fourth position, moving up from eighth in the 
previous survey… We believe this reflects the 
attention and effort over the past two years that 
has gone into better protection for remote 
and home workers.”

Application programming interfaces (APIs), which were in the 
middle of the pack last year, have now emerged as fourth-
highest area of concern. As organizations move to modular 
services-based cloud applications, APIs become more tempting 
targets for threat actors. Protecting APIs is likely to become an 
even bigger issue over the next few years. We will have more to 
say about this later in this report (pages 40 and 59).

One final observation: the security posture ratings increased 
from last year in every single category. This fact shows that 
organizations are feeling a little bit better about the defenses 
they have in place to stop cyberthreats. Perhaps this is an early 
sign that security teams are finally catching up with threat actors 
in their ongoing arms race.

## Assessing IT Security Functions
On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate the adequacy of your organization’s capabilities 
(people and processes) in each of the following functional areas of IT security:

This question asks respondents to rate the adequacy of their 
organization’s capabilities in different functional areas of 
IT security. The answers show us perceived strengths and 
weaknesses in security-related processes and programs (see 
Figure 9).

Organizations remain most positive about their capabilities for 
governance, risk and compliance (GRC) and identity and access 
management (IAM). These are followed closely by detection of 
advanced threats and application development and testing, 
two areas where many organizations have made considerable 
investments in the past couple of years.

![Figure 9: Perceived adequacy of functional security capabilities.]

However, respondents were somewhat less upbeat about their 
organization’s processes for security engineering, architecture, 
and design. That function was at the top of the list in the 
previous survey, but fell to sixth place in this one.

The area of greatest concern is attack surface reduction, which 
includes disciplines such as patch management, vulnerability 
management, penetration testing, and security configuration 
management. Attack surfaces have been expanding as workers 
use more mobile and personal devices in less-protected settings, 
and access applications hosted in a greater variety of cloud 
environments. Finding and fixing vulnerabilities across all these 
areas will be a growing challenge for the foreseeable future.

User security awareness and education is another significant 
challenge. Threat actors continue to develop ingenious phishing 
and social engineering campaigns to acquire valid credentials, 
plant malware, and otherwise leverage human weaknesses to 
further their malicious activities. As we will see on page 24, low 
security awareness among employees is now the second-most 
serious barrier to establishing effective defenses against 
cyberthreats (after a lack of skilled security personnel).

Another problematic functional area is third-party risk 
management (TPRM). It is very difficult to monitor, much less 
improve, the security practices of suppliers and other third 
parties that have access to an organization’s applications and 
data. The press continues to report major data breaches that 
originate from credentials and PII captured from third parties and 
from vulnerabilities and misconfiguration in vendors’ software 
and systems.

>“The area of greatest concern is attack 
surface reduction... Attack surfaces have been 
expanding... Finding and fixing vulnerabilities 
across all these areas will continue to be a 
growing challenge for the foreseeable future.”

We introduced a new functional area in this year’s survey: cyber 
risk quantification and reporting. We see many organizations 
devoting more time and resources to these activities recently. 
This trend is driven in a large part by the need to justify security 
investments to top executives and boards of directors, and to 
show progress toward security program goals. The data shows 
this area falling in the middle range as far as adequacy of 
capabilities.

We should note that our survey was conducted in November

Undoubtedly, concerns about functions like attack surface 
reduction and application testing have intensified considerably 
since then.

## The IT Security Skills Shortage
Select the roles/areas for which your organization is currently experiencing a shortfall of skilled 
IT security personnel. (Select all that apply.) 

A shortage of experienced IT security personnel has been a 
serious problem for the great majority of organizations for at 
least the past five years. As shown on page 24, it is the single 
most serious barrier to establishing effective defenses against 
cyberthreats.

Just like last year, the greatest unfilled demand is for security 
administrators, who have the critical job of installing, configuring, 
and maintaining security tools and infrastructure. Four out of 
10 organizations (40.1%) can’t find enough (see Figure 10).

![Figure 10: Cybersecurity skills shortage, by role.]

One in three organizations can’t find enough IT security analysts, 
operators, or incident responders (33.2%). The shortfall was 
slightly less than in the previous survey, when it was 35.0%. 
Almost one-third of organizations are short of IT security 
architects and engineers (32.4%), essentially the same as a 
year ago.

Rounding out the roles were application security testers (28.5%), 
DevSecOps engineers (28.0%), and risk and fraud analysts 
(24.0%). The deficit of application security testers and DevSecOps 
engineers worsened from the previous survey, probably the 
result of a turn toward building security into applications rather 
than relying entirely on perimeter defenses.

Figure 11 shows the percentage of organizations suffering from 
a shortfall of skilled IT security personnel in at least one role 
over the last five years. The trend is clearly upward, although 
surprisingly, the percentage fell somewhat in this survey, from 
87.0% to 84.1%. However, that lower number is comparable to 
the percentages in the two previous years, and still represents 
more than five out of six organizations. Also, in some countries 
90% or more of organizations couldn’t fill jobs in at least one 
category: South Africa (90%), Colombia (90.9%), China (93.9%), 
Singapore (94.0%), and Japan (100% !!!).

One explanation for this year’s leveling off is that more 
organizations are turning to managed security services providers 
(MSSPs) to outsource one or more security tasks. Statistics about
