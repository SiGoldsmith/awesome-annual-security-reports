It’s Always a PHISH 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Executive Summary

I f there is anything I hope the industry takes away from the Cofense 2022 State of Phishing Report, it is that 

threat actors are innovating but Secure Email Gateway vendors (SEGs) are not . I believe the number of real 
phish, reported by real users, found in all major SEG environments speaks for itself .

And speaking of numbers, 99% is a magical number in 
marketing, isn’t it? The great thing about touting 99% 
is it mentally brings the buyer to the conclusion that 
something is nearly perfect . Secure Email Gateway 
vendors (SEGs) artfully deploy the 99% claim because 
it gives them the insurance policy needed when their 
customers find phishing emails that made it past their 
layered defense . 

Thinking through the 99% claim at face value, that would 
imply they have a way to detect and measure what 
sneak’s past . But, if you know about the 1% that side\-
steps your filtering wouldn’t you block it to begin with? 

For example, “we block 99% of malware” sounds 
pretty good, right? But what if you knew that malware 
comprises less than 3% of the phishing emails reported 
by employees? We’ve been tabulating and reporting 
on the state of phishing for years now . In this report 
you will see exactly what percent of phishing emails 
are conversational (BEC), credential theft, and lastly 
malware . You block 99% of malware? Great! I’ll start 
polishing your participation trophy . 

Another word of advice, beware of self\-serving\-SEG 
bakeoffs . It starts with “let us show you what we catch 
that MicrosoftTM misses” . This bakeoff consists of a 
secret stash of contrived emails they know will make 
their solution look good . That game is over . Cofense 

builds, curates, and maintains real phishing samples that 
have been reported by humans . For the first time ever, 
we have brought a solution to market that lets you use 
Cofense data to test your vendors . Are you spending 
your budget on multiple layers of email defense? Do you 
have to? 

Also, the phishing simulation awareness mission is 
finished . Employees know what phishing is . Phishing 
simulations create a prepared workforce . Prepared to 
do what? Recognize and Report suspicious email . The 
data in this report wouldn’t be possible without the 
Cofense customers who have prepared their workforce 
to recognize and report suspicious email . We would not 
be able to blow the lid off the 99% claim without humans 
clicking the ‘Report Phishing’ button coupled with Security 
Operations professionals responding to those reports . 

WARNING to the ‘we block 99% of phishing’ SEG 
sales professionals: DO NOT READ THIS REPORT . 
If you read this report, it will shatter your 
confidence . You will not meet your quota . You will 
not go on the President’s Club Trip .

2022 State of Phishing – 
What’s in Your Inbox?

T here’s no question that the last year was filled with vulnerabilities that 

drained already exhausted security operations teams . Pile pandemic 
burnout and the impacts of the Great Resignation on top of that and we can 

all agree that it was a difficult year . Especially when it comes to having a clear 
understanding of, and defending against, evolving threats . 

The level of visibility Cofense has thanks to our extensive portfolio of email 
security solutions puts us in a unique position to understand the most 
prevalent threats and trends . This report dives into the three main phishing 
threat types we have seen over the last year – credential theft, business 
email compromise (BEC), and malware – and analyzes how these are 
affecting specific industries as well as the approach organizations are 
taking to defend themselves against them . 

Most of the data in this report has been collected from the Cofense 
Phishing Defense Center (PDC), the hub for our specialized, fully 
managed email security service . The Cofense PDC analyzes millions of 
phishing emails annually and provides insights like what you see to the 
right . Insights related to the tactics and techniques of threat actors 
using email as the vector to reach unsuspecting recipients . You’ll also 
find anecdotes gleaned from other parts of our portfolio that provide 
additional perspectives and insights that could be indicative of wider 
trends or things to come . As you dig into this data, it’s worth noting all 
emails analyzed have made their way into the inbox after bypassing 
email security controls – sometimes multiple layers .

Threat Actors, 
See You in the Cloud!

As organizations continue to move services to the 
cloud, including messaging, it’s not surprising credential 
phishing remains the top category hitting our customers 
with 67% of phish identified as malicious—10% higher 
than what we observed the previous year . Threat actors 
target credentials to ease their way into your network .

The second leading threat category we observed 
this year is Business Email Compromise (BEC) at 7% . 
To dig deeper into these types of threats, we dedicated 
a section of this report to focus on the details of the 
tactics we observed . 

While our analysts respond to reported emails in 
less than 60 minutes, the malicious category of 
“Threat Unavailable” ranks just under credentials at 23%, 
as actors quickly remove threats to minimize detection .

No industry has 
cracked the code on 
evading hackers . 
The trends are 
consistent across 
industries .

Secure Email Gateways Don’t Stop 
Advanced Phishing Attacks

When deciding between a variety of email security solutions available, many organizations opt for a Secure Email Gateway 
(SEG). One of the popular SEG features organizations can enable is URL detection control. URL detection control essentially 
re\-writes the URL, adding codes or characters that are unique to the SEG making it impossible for the user to quickly 
determine if they should interact with the link . Those same solutions also include features to block BEC . Threat actors figured 
this out and updated their tactics to use multiple stages in their delivery of either malware or a credential stealing page . 
They’ve adjusted the language used to get users to engage in a conversation that leads to various types of financial loss .

EMPOWER EMPLOYEES TO REPORT 
PHISHING THREATS

We need employees to report 
suspected phishing threats so 
we can find malicious emails in 
our environment. We outsource 
our reported email analysis to the 
Cofense Phishing Defense Center 
(PDC) through our Managed Phishing 
Detection and Response service, so 
we don’t have to worry about any 
SOC team resource constraints nor 
lag in responses. 

Cofense PDC’s email analysis is fast, 
accurate, and puts us in a proactive 
and efficient state. We reported over 
18k emails last month, and Cofense 
Managed PDR service’s average 
processing time was around 13 mins – 
that is so valuable and impressive.”

Hand Over Your 
Credentials!

A s organizations continue to adopt a “Cloud First” strategy, which includes 

migrating to Microsoft 365TM, it’s not surprising to see a 10\-percentage point 
increase in credential phishing attacks – now making up 67% of all phishing 

emails observed . 

Last year we added a new member to the Cofense family of solutions – Cofense 
Protect . Cofense Protect utilizes computer vision to analyze emails the way a human 
would, looking for any anomalies in email content and corresponding landing pages 
that may indicate a phish . Albeit a smaller volume of emails than what the PDC 
investigates, of the emails analyzed by Protect, we identified a growing trend of 
phishing campaigns containing HTML attachments . Last year, we recognized 
a 150% growth rate in HTML attachments found in phishing attacks . This 
represents about 30% of all credential phishing attacks detected by Protect . 

What’s the reason for the increase? Threat actors are aware that many 
solutions, including anti\-virus and SEGs, can detect most malicious file 
attachments, so they focus instead on HTML attachments . 

Why HTML? This file type is difficult to block as some business applications 
send this file type for legitimate purposes . Often, when the user opens the 
HTML file, it opens a login page they are familiar with using providing a false 
sense of security .

In 2021, 

67%

of all phishing 
attacks were 
credential theft

RECOMMENDATION: 
Restrict usage of this file type to only users in your organization that have a legitimate 
business purpose. Find the business/application owner that is sending these file 
attachments and find alternate ways to interact with the intended audience. Then block 
these file types from all inbound external messages. While this may seem overwhelming 
and time\-consuming, it will greatly reduce your risk of credential theft.

Credential Theft – 
What Can We Do About It?

According to a February 2022 Microsoft report, Multifactor Authentication enterprise 
adoption is slow at 22% . With this slow adoption and the volume of credential 
phish remaining high, we need to shift in how we train our workforce to recognize 
credential phishing to make them part of the solution . This is critical because as 
seen below, it is becoming increasingly difficult to identify a legitimate alert from 
cloud services . 

It was refreshing to see increased use of credential phishing simulations this past year, 
but there are additional steps you can take to help your users defend against threats . 
As we dig into these attacks, we recognize it can be difficult to easily detect these are 
bad . As you interact with the email, clicking on the link or HTML attachment, the login 
page opens – one that we’re all familiar with – and prompts us to enter our credentials . 
This is where we need to shift our training efforts .

Business Email Compromise: 
Did You Get Trapped in That Conversation?

B usiness Email Compromise (BEC) is responsible for billions of monetary losses across 

the globe . While there are multiple “flavors” of conversational\-based phishing attacks, the 
trends observed by Cofense include direct deposit scams, gift card fraud, and invoice scams . 

In 100% of these attacks, no malware, exploits, or malicious payloads are installed onto end\-user 
computers – they rely solely on human interaction .

Business Email Compromise: Direct Deposit Scam

BEC Phishing 
Attacks Rely 
Solely on 
Human 
Interaction

Direct Deposit Scam:

One of the more difficult\-to\-catch BEC attacks is direct deposit scams, also 
tracked as payroll diversion . To carry out these attacks, actors socially engineer 
those in payroll or human resources positions with requests to update employee 
direct deposit information to accounts under their control . 

To limit their chances of exposure, actors use disposable prepaid cards instead 
of traditional bank accounts to avoid detection and limit the impact of takedown . 
To add an extra layer of obfuscation, actors recruit money mules to purchase 
the prepaid cards on their behalf, making it even harder to detect who is behind 
the scam . 

To carry out these attacks, actors create email accounts looking like the victim 
they are going to re\-route payroll for and routinely ask what information is 
needed to change payroll . Once a conversation has started, actors may provide 
completed I9 forms or voided checks to raise the authenticity of the attack . 
Once successful, it can take weeks before these attacks are noticed, causing 
unnecessary stress to both the victim and the organization .

Hey, can you run a 
quick errand for me? I want 
to congratulate the employees for a 
great 2021, and I want to surprise them with 
a holiday gift. Can you give me your phone 
number? I want you to purchase $1,000 in 
gift cards. Don’t worry, I’ll reimburse 
you once I’m back in the office.

Sure it’s: 
703\-867\-5309

Great \- 
texting you now.

Ok, I’ll buy those 
gift cards today.

Business Email Compromise: Gift Card Fraud

Gift Card Fraud:

This is how gift card BEC works . Actors pretend to be the CEO or someone in 
authority while requesting the employee to run a “task” or “errand” on their 
behalf . In many cases, scammers request the cell phone number of employees 
to move the conversation out of the email chain and over to something that isn’t 
routinely tracked: SMS . Not only is it more difficult to track but having a phone 
number makes the attack seem more trustworthy, raising the likelihood that yes, 
the potential victim is speaking to someone in authority . 

While traditional BEC attacks routinely use the bank accounts of romance 
victims, it is becoming much more difficult for scammers to fully cash\-out their 
ill\-gotten gains . In addition, a small percentage is taken from the total amount at 
each hop, drastically diminishing the returns from the scammers . With gift card 
scams on the other hand, actors make use of gift card\-to\-crypto exchanges 
to convert their stolen gift cards directly to cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, 
within minutes . While the initial benefits and losses may seem small, actors 
are able to fly under the radar of federal, state, and local authorities due to the 
complexity of the scams . In addition, regulators do little to track gift cards which 
have been stolen, almost making this the perfect BEC crime .

Attackers will go to the 
extent of emulating original 
fonts, signatures, and 
grammar to help raise the 
chances of success of an 
invoice scam .

Business Email Compromise: Invoice Scam

Invoice Scam:

The first step of invoice scams can start weeks before the financial attack takes 
place, with most actors not knowing who their final victim will be . For the attack 
to be successful, an actor must first compromise an email account, through 
credential phishing or purchasing account credentials on the dark web, to gain 
access to the email account . Once compromised, actors set up email forward 
rules in the compromised inbox to lie, watch, and wait for the discussion of 
invoices or purchase orders . Once a potential attack vector has been identified, 
the actors will quickly create email infrastructure, forge invoices, and hijack 
threads to impersonate the legitimate invoice . To the end user, there are very 
few things they can detect as malicious in these attacks .

This is an especially heinous attack vector for many reasons . First, the attacker 
can lie in wait in an inbox for months before carrying out an attack . Second, 
since attackers use email forward rules to create persistence in the user's inbox, 
the industry standard of resetting a password after a breach will not help with 
the attack, as email forward rules still exist on the account . Third, by hijacking 
a known and trusted email thread, the attack is timely and typically known to 
the potential victim . Attackers will go to the extent of emulating original fonts, 
signatures, and grammar to help raise the chances of success .

The Year of Ransomware

W hile there were significant security incidents in the last year that leveraged major software 

vulnerabilities, we can’t overlook the impact ransomware had on organizations . We observed nearly 
100 malware families; however, the number of emails delivering malware was significantly lower than the 

previous year . It was also apparent that threat actors realized to make it to the inbox, they had to either use odd file types 
not detected by the SEG or deliver their malware through other tactics (hint: the cloud) . 

Get Upstream: Tackle the Phishing Problem 
Early Before Ransomware Takes Its Toll 

Ransomware has captured headlines for years, due to its sensationally disruptive 
nature . Phishing is now one of the primary entry points for ransomware 
operations targeting entire organizations and it is more important than ever to 
catch a ransomware operation at the phishing stage, before it is even identifiable as 
a ransomware attack . 

Once inside, a threat actor can use any of a large variety of custom and commodity 
tools to move laterally, escalate privileges, establish persistence, and deliver the 
final ransomware payload . Considering this, an excessive focus on signatures 
of the ransomware itself (often driven by media attention) is counterproductive . 
By the time an actual ransomware binary is detectable within a targeted 
organization’s network, it may be too late to mitigate the impact . To enable 
the necessary advanced protection, Cofense Intelligence has identified phishing 
payloads that are known to be precursors of ransomware and we continue to collect 
and publish signatures for these payloads, as part of associated phishing campaigns .

IT’S ALWAYS A PHISH

Phishing is oftentimes a preliminary part of a 
multi\-step ransomware operation process rather 
than the direct delivery mechanism itself . We see it 
in the tactics used to distribute one of the more well\-known 
ransomware variants – Conti ransomware . Conti ransomware 
operators are some of the most notable culprits when it comes 
to obtaining initial access to an organization or individual with 
a phish . Using this methodology, we saw many successful 
ransomware attacks over the last year, including the disruption 
of Ireland’s public healthcare system and halting business for a 
major Scandinavian hotel chain .1

Breaking Down 
a Ransomware Attack

While we don’t see “the ransomware” delivered in an email, it does start with a phish 
by first delivering tools to deploy their entry point to begin their mission . We’re going to 
dig into the following malware sample to shed light on how a threat actor would lay the 
groundwork to launch the attack . 

STEP

1

Looking at the phishing email to the right, we see an interesting file type use 
to deliver the malware \- AsyncRAT, a remote access tool . While this file type 
does not appear common to the general email user, the native Windows 
operating system has no problem executing this file . 

STEP

2

Once the phishing threat is delivered and a user opens the attachment, the 
AsyncRAT is installed and provides the threat actors access to a menu of 
options to execute their attack plan . 

STEP

3

Once inside the network, a threat actor can install a keylogger to gain 
access to credentials, do further reconnaissance of the organization, locate 
sensitive information and securely exfiltrate the data .

STEP

4

Once the threat actor has gained access and exfiltrated sensitive data, a 
ransom note is delivered to an organization . This has been a growing trend 
over the last couple of years to guarantee payment by threatening to leak 
the stolen data .

Phishing Prevention Starts 
With Human Conditioning

T here is one element of phishing prevention and detection that will always remain critical – humans . 

Humans will always be able to detect something about an email that is just not right . Continuous conditioning 
is critical to keep employees aware of the latest threats, the ones that are likely to end up in their inboxes .

Model Simulation Scenarios 
After Threats That Matter

Over the past few years, we’ve encouraged and recommended aligning your simulation program to what is landing in 
your user’s inbox when it comes to real phish . A bright spot we found was in the type of simulation campaigns sent . 
It’s exciting to see a 7\-percentage point increase in the number of campaigns that were simulating credential phish . 
Our customers are aligning their conditioning program with real threats landing in inboxes .

Timing Is Everything When 
Conducting Simulation Training

Not only does tuning your templates to the threat 
landscape help drive improved human conditioning, 
but so does timing . We recently published a Cofense 
Intelligence Strategic Analysis Report that examined 
the timing of the delivery of real phishing campaigns . 
By following their patterns, as seen in the chart 
to the right, it’s best to launch your simulation 
campaign on Tuesday or Wednesday .

Oops! I Did It Again: 
Addressing Repeat Clickers 

When it comes to identifying the riskiest corporate 
citizen, addressing your repeat clickers is certainly one 
way to reduce the risk to your organization . And while 
you may be tempted to rush to this step to fast track your 
program, it can take up to FOUR scenarios before they 
“get it .” One method we often recommend is to run a 
follow\-up scenario to only those who interacted with the 
scenario . However, it’s still recommended to filter this on 
your users who interacted with multiple scenarios .

While reducing the interaction (click) is often the 
focus with repeats, don’t forget to incorporate positive 
reinforcement to influence your report rate . Sending out 
a “Thank You for Reporting” follow\-up can go a long way 
to drive the desired behavior .

Phishing Simulation Training – 
No Manual Required

When we pioneered the phishing simulation market, 
we knew it may be tough for organizations to accept 
that running a simulation campaign is a teachable 
moment – not a “gotcha” exercise . To help demonstrate 
the effectiveness of this methodology, we wanted to 
highlight how long susceptible users are staying on the 
education page by providing this metric in the scenario 
campaign results . 

It didn’t surprise us that the time spent on simulation 
training aligned with what we knew to be true – users are 
decreasing their susceptibility while spending little time 
on the education landing page . 

We have aggregated the data across all campaigns 
for the year and found that 70% of users who click the 
link directing them to the education page fall into our 
first two\-time spent buckets (0\-9 and 10\-19 seconds). 
Many customers add their branding and logos to the 
landing page, giving the user a quick indication they just 
interacted with a simulation . 

It didn’t surprise us that this metric aligned 
with what we knew to be true – users are 
decreasing their susceptibility while spending 
little time on the education landing page.

When you combine this metric with our Repeat Clicker 
chart on the previous page, it’s clear that recipients are 
learning based on the dramatic decline in susceptibility .

It wouldn’t be a complete report without highlighting 
the susceptibility, reporting and resiliency results by 
industry, as we know your industry and sector networks 
are important to see how you align . 

As you might have guessed, industries with more 
regulation continue to show a higher resilience . We also 
recognize that organizations that run more frequent 
campaigns narrow their learning time . As you continue 
to mature your program, we recommend maintaining 
a higher frequency of simulations with more targeted 
business functions, such as finance or human resources .

As you might 
have guessed, 
industries with 
more regulation 
continue to 
show a higher 
resilience .

Catching Up With Cofense

www .cofense .com

What’s New? A Lot . 

COFENSE MANAGED PHISHING DETECTION AND 
RESPONSE SERVICES CAN HELP YOU AVOID A BREACH . 

Early on in our journey as a company, we grew our focus from solely security 
awareness simulation training to more broadly addressing the real phishing threats 
facing organizations . When it comes to solving these problems, there are two 
common ways you can enhance a product line: acquisition or innovation . We opted 
for the one\-two\-punch, both acquisition and continuous innovation – taking our 
multi\-layered email security architecture to a whole new level . 

Last year we welcomed the people and technology of Cyberfish into the Cofense 
family, bringing computer vision and artificial intelligence to our portfolio and 
stopping phishing emails in real time before they have been reported or added to 
block lists . Now known as Cofense Protect, hundreds of organizations are already 
using this innovative technology for real\-time protection against unknown threats 
by scanning emails and landing pages as a human would – noting discrepancies in 
images, language, and behavior to catch attacks that evade more traditional email 
security solutions . 

We have also introduced Cofense Validator, the only product available that uses real, 
active phishing threats to test the efficacy of secure email gateways (SEGs), giving 
organizations a clear and objective understanding of how their SEG is performing 
against live phishing threats .

We also celebrated five years without phishing related breaches for any of our 
managed service customers . That means since its inception in 2016, we have seen 
nothing but success when it comes to the service performed for our customers . The 
combination of human expertise, the power of always evolving Cofense solutions, and 
strong partnerships with each organization is the perfect recipe for success when it 
comes to defending against phishing attacks . 

This product has provided staff augmentation to both a lean 
Information Security team as well as lean support teams that 
do not have the bandwidth to field reports from \~5k users. 
With this, it is “set it and forget it.” Our users are able to report, 
get back accurate information, and if an email is found to be 
malicious, the appropriate teams receive email alerts to take 
necessary remediation efforts.”

Trust Radius review 

The Cofense Phishing Defense Center is really helping our 
organization to analyze threats and block the malicious 
ones before reporting. Its threat hunting capability through 
intelligent scanning and monitoring of the global networks 
is really impressive and trustworthy. Before, there was a lot 
of risk in manual hunting and reporting at the same time. 
Now, with the arrival of Cofense PDC, that pressure has been 
relieved because of the automation, and the IT and SecOps 
team has been relieved.”

The continuous evolution and demonstrable results of our 
solutions show that the mission remains clear for Cofense: 
We stop phish .
