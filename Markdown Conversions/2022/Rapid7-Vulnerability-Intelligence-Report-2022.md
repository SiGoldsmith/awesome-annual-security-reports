## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Security, IT, and other teams tasked with vulnerability management and risk 
reduction operate in high-urgency, high-stakes environments where informed 
decision-making hinges on the ability to quickly find signal in a sea of perpetual 
noise. When a new potential threat emerges, information security professionals 
often find themselves needing to translate vague descriptions and untested 
research artifacts into actionable intelligence for their own particular risk models. 
Rapid7 researchers analyze thousands of 
vulnerabilities each year to understand root 
causes, dispel misconceptions, and share 
information on why certain flaws are more 
likely to be exploited than others.

Rapid7’s Vulnerability Intelligence Report examines notable vulnerabilities 
and high-impact attacks from 2022 in order to highlight exploitation trends, 
explore attacker use cases, and offer a framework for understanding new 
security threats as they arise. Our aim is to contextualize the vulnerabilities 
that introduce serious risk to a wide range of organizations. 

The report examines 50 vulnerabilities that pose considerable risk to organizations 
of all sizes. In total, this report includes 45 vulnerabilities that were exploited in 
the wild in 2022, of which 44% arose from zero-day exploits. See our appendix 
for additional context on vulnerability selection.

Attackers are still developing and deploying exploits faster than 
ever. 56% of the vulnerabilities in this report were exploited within 
seven days of public disclosure — a 12% rise over 2021 and an 
87% rise over 2020. 

Only 14 of the vulnerabilities in this report are known to have been 
exploited to carry out ransomware attacks — a significant (33%) 
decrease from 2021 despite consistent ransomware activity. This 
may indicate that ransomware operations have become less reliant 
on new vulnerabilities, but it may also stem from other factors, like 
lower reporting of ransomware incidents.

Other vulnerability and exploit trends examined in this report 
include ransomware ecosystem complexity, privilege escalation 
from the network perimeter, and the long tail of exploitation across 
older vulnerabilities.

The full 2022 dataset is available in the appendix. 

Widespread exploitation of new vulnerabilities decreased somewhat 
in 2022, but broad, opportunistic attacks still drove considerable risk. 
Rapid7’s vulnerability research team tracked 28 net-new widespread 
threats in 2022, a 15% decrease in widespread threats from 2021. 

Zero-day exploitation was still a significant threat in 2022, though 
we saw a modest decline in mass zero-day attacks. 43% of the 
widespread threats Rapid7 researchers analyzed in 2022 began 
with a zero-day exploit, down from 52% in 2021. 

2022 findings include:

The past three years have witnessed a convergence of major attack trends 
that shaped the security landscape with blunt force. Zero-day exploitation hit 
an all-time high in 2021, ransomware business models matured and expanded 
with devastating effect, and organizations were plagued by widespread attacks 
on business-critical technologies. For many, 2021 was a sledgehammer — not 
always terribly sophisticated, but undeniably effective at distributing damage 
across a broad area. 

The security landscape in 2022 has been marked by more nuance. Zero-day 
exploitation seems to have plateaued at high elevation, but zero-day exploits 
morphed into mass exploitation events less frequently than they did in 2021. 
The volume of ransomware incidents continued to rise, but there are fewer CVEs 
mapped directly to ransomware in our 2022 report data than there were in 2021.

Finally, as always, we saw celebrity vulnerabilities and hotly anticipated security 
releases whose practical impact ended up being rather low — but impracticality 
failed to deter attackers from indiscriminately lobbing exploits at internet-
accessible targets, searching in vain for vulnerable code paths that often failed 
to materialize. In other words, definitively classifying and communicating risk 
was more complex in 2022, even for research teams whose bread and butter 
is vulnerability and exploit intelligence.    

Many organizations spent the first weeks (or 
months) of 2022 working their way down a 
lengthy list of Log4Shell remediations, taxing IT 
and security team resources that had already 
been depleted by shrinking budgets and 
pandemic exhaustion. 

Despite the vulnerability’s undeniable impact, it turned out to be somewhat 
overrated as a universal attack vector; instead, application-specific exploits 
had to be crafted for valuable target technologies, a number of which fell prey 
to Log4Shell exploitation in January 2022 and beyond. A months-long tail of 
vendor impact assessments and downstream patches — many of which required 
constant monitoring of advisories and community forums — also compounded 
vulnerability management challenges for overburdened IT security teams.

The security landscape in 2022 was not shaped by Log4Shell alone, of course, 
just as 2021’s threat landscape featured dozens of widely exploited flaws and 
high-profile attacks before December 9 rolled around. But the vulnerability that 
the U.S. Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) called “endemic” did set the stage 
for community-wide vulnerability response in 2022 in several key ways. 

First, Log4Shell trauma put businesses in a heightened state of ready alert, 
driving stronger-than-usual reactions to subsequent vulnerabilities in popular 
libraries and frameworks. Neither “Spring4Shell’’ nor the not-so-aptly named 
“Text4Shell” merited its moniker, for instance. Moreover, the opportunity cost 
of an all-consuming response to a vulnerability like Spring4Shell turned out to 
be high: Between March 25 and April 6, 2022, seven different vulnerabilities that 
eventually saw significant exploitation came to light, including three zero-day 
flaws and a critical VMware attack chain that was exploited for full system 
takeover within 48 hours of disclosure. In hindsight, any number of these other 
flaws was arguably more urgent than Spring4Shell, but Log4Shell response 
6
syndrome meant that organizations — including security companies — sunk 
resources disproportionately into vulnerabilities that looked similar to CVE-2021-
44228 on the surface, delaying or deprioritizing mitigations for other issues. 

Log4Shell’s dragging tail of downstream advisories also served to emphasize the 
importance of transparent, timely, standardized vulnerability disclosure practices 
in a healthy security ecosystem. There were plenty of software producers 
whose teams worked overtime to assess and communicate Log4Shell impact 
clearly in the days and weeks following the incident, but there were also plenty 
of cases where security teams were left wondering about uncommunicated 
risk. While there are a few technology vendors that embrace plain-spoken 
frankness about vulnerabilities, the industry has plenty more ground to cover 
to ensure there are clear-cut, openly accessible security advisories that include 
technical vulnerability details, attack scenarios, and timelines of exploitation. 
In a persistently elevated threat climate, with overt dependencies on common 
frameworks and shared components, transparency and useful intelligence 
sharing should be the ground floor, not the ceiling. 

Admittedly, doing all this well requires an abundance of security expertise. In 
an uneasy socioeconomic climate, concurrent crises are a stark reminder that 
markets depend on people to drive innovation and uphold critical infrastructure, 
as our strained healthcare systems have demonstrated so plainly these past 
few years. When droves of security practitioners are at risk of succumbing to 
burnout, we face an intersectional dilemma with broad business implications.

In an industry captivated by the promises and 
potential of advanced technology, it can be 
easy to forget that the fundamental practice of 
security is not merely mechanical, but creative. 
It requires the ability to make connections,  
to think ahead, and above all, to make 
informed decisions when “risk” is a value 
constantly in flux. 

As ever, this report strives to provide a framework for risk-based decision 
making, backed by both original analysis from Rapid7 research teams and 
robust, well-documented third-party sources.

## 2022 Exploited and Significant Vulnerabilities
Rapid7 vulnerability researchers prioritize CVEs that are likely to impact many 
organizations, instead of those likely to affect only a few. We intentionally 
differentiate mass attacks from smaller-scale or targeted exploitation; when 
a vulnerability is exploited by many attackers across many different industries 
and organizations, we deem that vulnerability a widespread threat. As a rule, 
organizations should expect to conduct incident response investigations that 
look for IOCs and post-exploitation activity during widespread threat events 
in addition to activating emergency patching protocols. 

Vulnerabilities categorized as threats have been confirmed to be exploited in the 
wild by reputable sources (including Rapid7’s own Labs and services teams), 
but in a more limited or targeted fashion than CVEs classified as widespread 
threats. Impending threats, on the other hand, have not yet seen exploitation 
by adversaries, but in our view are likely and valuable attack targets.

**2022 Vulnerabilities by Threat Status**

### What is a threat?
A threat exists when there is an adversary with the intent, capability, and opportunity 
to act. When only two of these elements are present (e.g., intent and opportunity), we 
call it an impending threat. When just one element is present (e.g., an opportunity in 
the form of a vulnerability), it is a potential threat.

### Widespread Threats
Once again, widespread threats comprised the majority of our 2022 vulnerability 
dataset (56%), down from 66% in 2021. Common payloads dropped during mass 
exploitation included cryptocurrency miners, web shells, and a variety of botnet 
malware in addition to an ever more diverse set of ransomware payloads. At 
time of writing, all of the CVEs listed below except one (CVE-2022-33891) were 
on the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) Known 
Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) list.

For the most part, the first six weeks of 2022 were dominated by widespread 
exploitation of various business-critical technologies vulnerable to Log4Shell. In 
particular, VMware vCenter and Horizon servers saw sustained mass attacks, 
prompting warnings from CISA and the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) in 
addition to security company communications about observed exploitation. 
Rapid7 managed services teams observed exploitation across dozens of 
customers in January. Attackers also targeted Ubiquiti UniFi controllers and 
Zyxel devices, both of which offered initial access vectors. 

Unrelated to Log4Shell, CVE-2021-20038, a Rapid7-discovered buffer overflow 
in SonicWall SMA 100 devices, began seeing rather clumsy exploitation 
attempts the last week of January 2022. In defiance of barriers to scalable 
exploitation, CVE-2021-20038 made CISA’s April 2022 list of “Routinely Exploited 
Vulnerabilities,” landing it squarely in widespread threat territory, unpredictable 
as that outcome may have been. In the last few weeks of 2022, Rapid7 was also 
* Exploitation in the wild privately reported to Rapid7
11
informed privately that at least one organization saw in-the-wild exploitation 
of CVE-2021-20038 as early as December 16, 2021, a mere nine days after 
SonicWall sent customers their disclosure — and three-plus weeks before 
Rapid7’s research team published our own. 

Success, or lack thereof, of exploit attempts was a recurring topic of conversation 
throughout 2022. Astute readers may have noticed that Spring4Shell (CVE-
2022-22965) is conspicuously missing from our catalog of widespread 
threats, in spite of well-documented mass exploitation attempts. While the 
occasional web shell did make it onto a host via Spring4Shell, it’s not clear that 
the vast majority of these exploit attempts were hitting vulnerable code paths. 
Similarly, the ironically named “Text4Shell” (CVE-2022-42889) — a remote code 
execution bug in Apache Commons Text that we refused on principle to include 
in our dataset at all — saw a high volume of exploit attempts within a week of 
disclosure, but we’re still awaiting definitive confirmation that any vulnerable 
real-world applications were actually affected.

March, April, and May made for a blustery spring for security teams, with a 
widely exploited vulnerability appearing roughly once a week for the whole of 
the three-month period, though notably, exploitation wasn’t always immediate. 
Remote code execution bugs in Spring Cloud Gateway (CVE-2022-22947) and 
Spring Cloud Function (CVE-2022-22963) rounded out a bad March for Spring 
12
products: CVE-2022-22947 was eventually incorporated into the cryptojacking 
Sysrv-K botnet, per Microsoft. Matthew Remacle, a researcher at security 
firm GreyNoise Intelligence, privately shared data on several spikes of activity 
targeting Spring Cloud Function, with the highest payload count manifesting 
in Q2 2022; most of the payloads GreyNoise saw were indicative of low-skilled 
attacks (i.e., a heavy concentration of repurposed Nuclei templates).  

At the end of the first week of April, VMware published an advisory warning 
of serious remote code execution (CVE-2022-22954) and privilege escalation 
(CVE-2022-22960) flaws in their Workspace ONE Access solution. On May 18, 
CISA issued an alert about threat actor activity that had evidently started only 
two days out from the original advisory. The chain would turn out to be one of 
the most widely used attacks of 2022: to date, the vulnerabilities have been 
exploited to deploy ransomware, drop coin miners, install botnet malware, 
and more. 

May brought remote code execution vulnerabilities in F5 BIG-IP (CVE-2022-
1388) and Zyxel firewalls (CVE-2022-30525), both of which were exploited to 
drop cryptocurrency miners and web shells within a few days. Naturally, just 
before Memorial Day in the U.S., the security research community discovered 
a novel malicious document file that had been used in the wild and was 
evading Windows Defender detection. The maldoc attack vector turned out 
to be a zero-day flaw in the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT). The 
community nicknamed the vulnerability “Follina” before Microsoft assigned 
CVE-2022-30190 several days later. 

Community interest in the Follina mystery may have contributed to the vuln’s 
weirdly enduring notoriety: Despite the fact that Follina is one of many malicious 
attachment-type attacks used in the wild, ransomware actors seem to have 
picked it up, and security firm WatchGuard named it a “top security incident” in 
a mid-year threat report. Rapid7’s own threat intel detection engineering team 
also noted a steady stream of Follina detections in the weeks following the 
vulnerability’s discovery, with one big caveat — namely, that the overwhelming 
majority of detections were security personnel testing proofs of concept, or 
the occasional pen tester executing a social engineering operation.

The Follina buzz hadn’t yet faded when one of 2022’s defining security incidents 
hit, looking to steal the mass exploitation crown from earlier VMware Workspace 
ONE Access and F5 BIG-IP CVEs. On June 2, Australian technology company 
Atlassian published a security advisory for CVE-2022-26134, an actively exploited 
zero-day remote code execution vulnerability in on-premise instances of its 
hugely popular Confluence software. At the time of the advisory’s publication, 
CVE-2022-26134 was unpatched; Atlassian released a fix on June 3, after 
13
making the (correct) decision to release vulnerability information the day prior. 
The Confluence vulnerability offered a classic example of “many attackers, 
many targets,” as ransomware groups, cryptocurrency mining campaigns, and 
state-sponsored threat actors leveraged CVE-2022-26134 for nefarious ends. 

Other 2022 widespread threats included CVE-2022-40684, a critical authentication 
bypass in widely deployed Fortinet firewalls and web proxies; CVE-2022-29499, 
a zero-day vulnerability in Mitel MiVoice Connect appliances that provided an 
initial access vector for Lorenz ransomware; CVE-2022-26138, a hard-coded 
password vulnerability in Atlassian’s Questions for Confluence application; 
yet another QNAP zero-day flaw (CVE-2022-27593) used in prolific DeadBolt 
ransomware attacks; and a mind-boggling array of Zimbra Collaboration Suite 
vulnerabilities, including two zero-days (CVE-2022-37042, CVE-2022-41352) 
and an upstream bug in unRAR (CVE-2022-30333) that were all used to deploy 
web shells in the wild. 

### We Need to Talk About Exchange (Again)
Well, here we are again. If anyone bet a pony on 2022 offering a reprieve from 
widely exploited vulnerabilities in on-premises instances of Microsoft Exchange 
Server, they lost that bet definitively. At the end of September 2022, Vietnamese 
security firm GTSC published information and IOCs on what they claimed was 
a pair of unpatched Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities being used in 
attacks on their customers’ environments dating back to early August. Microsoft 
confirmed both zero-day vulnerabilities later the same day and said they were 
aware of "limited, targeted attacks” using the two vulnerabilities, which were 
assigned CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082. 

The vulns required authenticated network access for successful exploitation 
and appeared to be a variant of 2021’s infamous ProxyShell attack chain (CVE-
2021-34523, CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-31207), though notably, ProxyShell 
didn’t require authentication. Security researcher Kevin Beaumont christened 
the new zero-day chain “ProxyNotShell,” as security teams waited hopefully 
for a quick fix. 

It didn’t come. October 2022’s Patch Tuesday came and went without a patch 
for the ProxyNotShell vulns, and systems administrators had to make do with 
a temporary mitigation—more specifically, a regular expression-based block 
rule that attackers quickly bypassed. Microsoft updated the rule, attackers 
bypassed it again, and on and on the cycle went, leaving security teams 
confused and frustrated.

A true fix arrived on November 8, 2022, but historically, Exchange patch 
uptake has been much slower than the pace of attacks. Six weeks after the 
patch was released, mere days before Christmas, security firm CrowdStrike 
published a blog disclosing a fresh exploit technique that bypassed Microsoft’s 
suggested mitigation technique by using the Outlook Web Application (OWA) 
endpoint as the initial attack vector rather than the Autodiscover endpoint 
Microsoft’s block rule had considered. CrowdStrike had discovered the 
new exploit while investigating several Play ransomware incidents. Rapid7 
managed services teams similarly saw an uptick in incidents stemming 
from exploitation of unpatched Microsoft Exchange Server installations, 
including to deploy ransomware.

The spruced-up attack chain was nicknamed “OWASSRF.” But only servers 
that hadn’t applied the November 8 patch were vulnerable to the new 
technique; CrowdStrike assessed that the OWA vector probably mapped 
to CVE-2022-41080, which was fixed at the same time as CVE-2022-41040 
(whose exploitation was the first step in the original ProxyNotShell attack 
chain) and CVE-2022-41082 (the secondary remote code execution step). 

Even with a fresh barrage of attacks aimed at Exchange servers, tens of 
thousands of vulnerable systems persist on the open internet. We hear 2023 
might finally be the year of the Linux desktop — maybe it’ll also be a year 
without fresh 0day in on-prem Exchange.

### Other Known Exploited Vulnerabilities
Rapid7 teams tracked a number of known-exploited vulnerabilities in 2022 
that were not categorized as widespread threats, 17 of which we deemed 
interesting or notable. This category usually carries a little bit of intrigue, as 
known-exploited flaws with no evidence of widespread exploitation are, in our 
experience, likelier to have arisen from zero-day exploits (mystery!), and also 
likelier to lack in-depth details (rude!). At time of writing, two of the vulnerabilities 
listed below (CVE-2022-31199, CVE-2022-28810) were not on CISA’s KEV list.

Of particular note are five different zero-day vulnerabilities in security gateway 
and firewall products, all of which seem to have been exploited before disclosure, 
in addition to a mysterious vuln in WatchGuard Firebox (CVE-2022-26318) that 
we couldn’t confirm was exploited as a zero-day, and that may be linked to 
Cyclops Blink threat activity detailed in a February 2022 CISA alert. There’s also 
little detail on exploits or threat actors targeting Fortinet (CVE-2022-42475) 
and Trend Micro Apex One (CVE-2022-40139), though this was one of at least 
two Apex One zero-day vulnerabilities that debuted in 2022. 

More is known about CVE-2022-27518 thanks to a December 2022 U.S. National 
Security Agency (NSA) bulletin on APT5 activity targeting Citrix ADC installations. 
CVE-2022-27518 isn’t mentioned explicitly, but the document contains a link 
to Citrix’s advisory, which was published the same day as the NSA warning. 
Rapid7 has also kept an eye on Citrix ADC as a perennially popular target for 
both skilled and commodity attackers.

Rounding out the security gateway entries are CVE-2022-3236 and CVE-2022-
1040, two remote code execution vulnerabilities in Sophos Firewalls that were 
exploited in targeted attacks against South Asian customers, as indicated in 
disclosures released six months apart. Initially we didn’t pay much attention to 
these, as Sophos Firewalls auto-update by default (yay!), which should mean 
less opportunity for many attackers to exploit the vulns. But the number of 
advanced threat actors using CVE-2022-1040 is, frankly, compelling: The flaw 
has been linked to APT operations targeting Ukraine, Tibetans, and South 
Asian victims in Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.
