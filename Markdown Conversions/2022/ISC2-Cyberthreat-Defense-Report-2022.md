CyberEdge’s annual Cyberthreat Defense Report (CDR) plays a 
unique role in the IT security industry Other surveys do a great 
job of collecting statistics on cyberattacks and data breaches 
and exploring the techniques of cybercriminals and other bad 
actors Our mission is to provide deep insight into the minds of IT 
security professionals 

Now in its ninth year, the CDR has become a staple among IT 
security leaders and practitioners by helping them gauge their 
internal practices and security investments against those of their 
counterparts across multiple countries and industries If you 
want to know what your peers in IT security are thinking and 
doing, this is the place to look 

CyberEdge would like to thank our Silver, Gold, and Platinum 
research sponsors, whose continued support is essential to the 
success of this report 

Top Five Insights for 2022

Survey Demographics

• Responses received from 1,200 qualified IT security 

decision makers and practitioners

• All from organizations with more than 500 employees

• Representing 17 countries across North America, 

Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, 
and Africa

• Representing 19 industries

 Among cyberthreats, ransomware and account takeover 
(ATO) attacks are poised to overtake malware as the \#1 
concern Malware is still perceived as the most important 
threat, but ATO and credential abuse attacks moved up from 
fourth place last year to \#2 this year, and ransomware is only 
a tad behind We think one or the other will take over the top 
spot in the next year or two (see page 17\) 

As always, our latest CDR installment yields dozens of actionable 
insights But the following are the top five takeaways from this 
year’s report:

 There has been no let\-up in pressure on security teams 
While the number of organizations that experienced a 
successful cyberattack dropped a touch from 86 2% in 
the previous survey to 85 3% in this one, the percentage 
victimized by six or more attacks increased to a new record 
of 40 7% And the number of respondents who think it 
is somewhat or very likely that their organization will be 
successfully attacked in the coming year reached a new 
record of 76 1% 

 The biggest security issues for many organizations are 
a persistent shortfall of skilled IT security personnel 
and low security awareness among employees These 
continue to top the list of factors that inhibit organizations 
from adequately defending themselves against cyberthreats 
(see page 24\) We also see a lack of security skills across a 
wide range of job roles (page 15\) and find user security 
awareness to be an area where our survey respondents 
doubt their organization’s capabilities (page 13\) 

 Pressure from ransomware rachets up once again The 
percentage of organizations victimized by a ransomware 
attack in the past 12 months rose 2 5% to reach a new high 
of 71 0% Ransom demands continued to rise, and the 
percentage of organizations deciding to pay jumped from 
57 0% to 62 9%, also a record The data also points to a “sweet 
spot” for ransomware gangs: organizations with 5,000 to 
25,000 employees These are being targeted more often than 
their smaller and larger counterparts because they can afford 
to pay high ransoms, yet disabling them does not typically 
disrupt local economies or shut down essential infrastructure 
and draw the attention of national governments and law 
enforcement agencies (see page 21\)

 Security teams are getting a handle on the new norm 
created by COVID\-19 After scrambling to adapt to the 
disruptions caused by the pandemic, they are now well 
along in deploying and managing technologies and 
processes to build security into web and mobile applications, 
make work from home (WFH) secure, and improve the 
security and economics of networking with cloud\-based 
resources (see pages 50, 52, and 54, respectively)

Cyberwar and the Russian Invasion of Ukraine

 Where do we have gaps in our cyberthreat defenses relative 

This report is being written during the early stages of Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine Obviously, our survey results don’t reflect the 
impact of that event However, in “The Road Ahead” section that 
begins on page 56, we offer some predictions about how the 
invasion may affect information security and the cybersecurity 
industry 

About This Report

The CDR is the most geographically comprehensive, vendor\-
agnostic study of IT security decision makers and practitioners 
Rather than compiling cyberthreat statistics and assessing 
the damage caused by data breaches, the CDR surveys the 
perceptions of IT security professionals, gaining insights into 
how they see the world 

Specifically, the CDR examines:

 The frequency of successful cyberattacks in the prior year and 
optimism (or pessimism) about preventing further attacks in 
the coming year

 The perceived impact of cyberthreats and the challenges 

to other organizations?

 Have we fallen behind in our defensive strategy to the point 

that our organization is now the “low\-hanging fruit” (i e , likely 
to be targeted more often due to its relative weaknesses)?

 Are we on track with both our approach and progress in 

continuing to address traditional areas of concern, while also 
tackling the challenges of emerging threats?

 How does our level of spending on IT security compare to 

that of other organizations?

 Do other IT security practitioners think differently from us 

about cyberthreats and their defenses, and should we adjust 
our perspective and plans to account for these differences?

Another important objective of the CDR is to provide developers 
of IT security technologies and services with information they 
can use to better align their solutions with the concerns and 
requirements of potential customers Our data can lead to better 
market traction and success for solution providers, along with 
better cyberthreat protection technologies for all the intrepid 
defenders out there 

faced in mitigating their risks

The findings of the CDR are divided into four sections:

 The adequacy of organizations’ security postures and their 

internal security practices

 The organizational factors that present the most significant 

barriers to establishing effective cyberthreat defenses

 The investments in security technologies already made and 

those planned for the coming year

 The health of IT security budgets and the portion of the 

overall IT budget they consume

By revealing these details, we hope to help IT security decision 
makers and practitioners gain a better understanding of how 
their perceptions, concerns, priorities, and defenses stack 
up against those of their peers around the world IT security 
teams can use the data, analyses, and findings to answer many 
important questions, such as: 

Section 1: Current Security Posture

Our journey into the world of cyberthreat defenses begins 
with respondents’ assessments of the effectiveness of their 
organization’s investments and strategies relative to the 
prevailing threat landscape They report on the frequency of 
successful cyberattacks, judge their organization’s security 
posture in specific IT domains and security functions, and 
provide details on the IT security skills shortage The data will 
help you begin to assess:

 Whether, to what extent, and how urgently changes are 

needed in your organization

 Specific countermeasures that should be added to 

supplement your existing defenses

email at research@cyber\-edge com 

In this section, our exploration of cyberthreat defenses shifts 
from establishing baseline security postures to determining 
the types of cyberthreats and obstacles to security that most 
concern today’s organizations The survey respondents weigh 
in on the most alarming cyberthreats, barriers to establishing 
effective defenses, and high\-profile issues such as ransomware 
and cloud application security We also look at how IT security 
training and professional certification can help enterprises 
address the serious shortfall in skilled IT security staff These 
appraisals will help you think about how your organization can 
best improve your cyberthreat defenses going forward 

Section 3: Current and Future Investments

Your organization can ill afford to stand still when it comes to 
maintaining effective cyberthreat defenses Your IT security 
team must keep pace with changes occurring in business, 
technology, and threat landscapes This section of the survey 
provides data on the direction of IT security budgets, and on 
current and planned investments in network security, endpoint 
security, application and data security, security management 
and operations, and identity and access management You will 
be able to compare your organization’s investment decisions 
against the broad sample and get a sense of what “hot” 
technologies your peers are deploying 

Section 4: Practices and Strategies

Mitigating today’s cyberthreat risks takes more than investing 
in the right technologies You must ensure those technologies 
are deployed optimally, configured correctly, and monitored 
adequately to give your organization a fighting chance to avoid 
being a front\-page news story In the final section of the survey 
our respondents provide information on how they are deploying 
and using leading\-edge technologies and services for tasks such 
as strengthening application security and protecting employees 
working from home

successful attack is likely in the coming year reached a new 
record of 76 1% (page 9\) 

 SaaS apps well protected Respondents have confidence in 
the security posture of SaaS companies, but not so much in 
their own mobile devices or APIs (page 11\) 

 Attack surface blues? Respondents have doubts about their 
organization’s ability to manage attack surfaces – and about 
user security awareness (page 13\) 

 Ongoing talent drought 84 1% of organizations can’t find 
enough skilled security people If you are one, ask for a raise 
(page 15\)!

Perceptions and Concerns
 New threats rising ATO and ransomware attacks are closing 
in on malware as the cyberthreats of greatest concern (page 
17\) 

 PII and credentials at risk Among web and mobile 

application attacks, PII harvesting and ATO are the most 
prevalent and concerning (page 19\) 

 Good and bad news on ransomware Damage from 

ransomware continues to grow, but governments and law 
enforcement agencies are finally striking back (page 21\) 

 People problems persist Yet again, the two biggest barriers 

to effective security are a lack of skilled personnel and 
employees’ low security awareness (page 24\) 

 Integrated defenses are good for you Respondents cite 
multiple benefits of unified app and data security defenses 
(page 26\) 

 Hybrid cloud security challenges Distributing apps 

across data centers and cloud platforms creates significant 
challenges for security teams (page 28\) 

 Cloud and software security education requested 

Security professionals see certifications, especially in cloud 
and software security, as career boosters (page 30\) 

 Network security warhorses Five security technologies are 
currently in use in at least 55% of organizations (page 36\) 

 Endpoint security basics Basic anti\-virus is ubiquitous on 
endpoints, and EDR, DLP, and EPP are popular Deception 
technology is an intriguing newcomer (page 38\) 

 Watch those APIs! Solutions to protect APIs are the leading 
application and data security technology, adopted in almost 
two\-thirds of organizations (page 40\) 

 Must manage risk In the area of security management, 
cyber risk management and reporting products are 
becoming essential (page 42\) 

 Identities at center stage Last year, organizations increased 
their use of nine of the 10 identity and access management 
technologies we follow (page 44\) 

 MSSPs making friends Because of staffing shortages, 
organizations are outsourcing more tasks to managed 
security service providers (page 46\) 

Practices and Strategies
 Cloud security edging ahead The percentage of security 

applications and services delivered via the cloud rose 0 5%, to 
41 1% (page 48\) 

 Baking security into the app Organizations are embracing 

a range of technologies to enhance application security (page 
50\) 

 Safe at home To protect work from home, organizations rely 
on old standbys like anti\-virus solutions and VPNs and new 
approaches like SASE and ZTNA (page 52\) 

 Security in packets and hardware Organizations are rapidly 
deploying SD\-WAN technology and hardware\-based security 
(page 54\)

A short summary of the cybersecurity landscape over the past 
year: gale\-force winds continue 

More than six out of seven organizations (85 3%) experienced 
a successful cyberattack within the last 12 months That’s down 
a touch from the previous year’s record high of 86 2%, but 
still substantially larger than in any of the prior seven years of 
this survey The number of organizations suffering six or more 
successful attacks set a new record of 40 7% That contrasts with 
only 16 2% eight years ago (see Figures 1 and 2\) 

In the course of this report, we will explore many reasons why 
the pressure on IT security teams has remained so strong 

“A short summary of the cybersecurity 

landscape over the past year: gale\-force 

winds continue ”

It isn’t a matter of money: IT security budgets have continued 
to grow in most places, albeit at a slightly slower rate than in 
previous years (page 24\) In fact, lack of budget ranks near the 
bottom of the list of factors that inhibit security teams from 
adequately defending against cyberthreats (page 24\) 

However, the typical organization’s attack surface continues 
to expand, driven primarily by the effects of the COVID\-19 
pandemic Security teams must work hard to protect more 
employees working from home (page 52\), protect more software 
in hybrid cloud environments (page 28\), and build better security 
into web and mobile applications (page 19\) At the same time, 
security teams are facing insidious new threats Two of the

blockbuster issues of the past year have been the increasing 
popularity (for cybercriminals) of double extortion ransomware, 
which not only encrypts data but also exfiltrates it to the web 
(where it can be published), and vulnerabilities in the Log4j 
utility from Apache, which could potentially affect 3 billion 
devices and applications 

And the pressure can’t be relieved by hiring, since the vast 
majority (84 1%) of organizations are already experiencing a 
shortfall in IT security personnel (page 15\) 

But don’t give up hope We will also review the technologies 
that organizations are planning to implement in areas such 
as network, endpoint, application, and identity security 
(pages 36\-45\) and how organizations can use security training 
and certifications to move junior security professionals into 
more\-advanced roles (page 30\) 

Now, back to our data about successful cyberattacks in the past year 

Of the seven major industries surveyed for this report, education 
was the most often victimized for the second year in a row 
(90 5%), followed closely by telecom and technology (90 3%)

Not far behind were finance (88 2%), manufacturing (86 4%), and 
retail (85 6%) Healthcare (75 3%) and government (68 2%) were 
affected somewhat less often (see Figure 3\) 

Looking globally, the countries with the highest percentage 
of organizations successfully attacked were Colombia (93 9%), 
Turkey (93 7%), Spain (91 8%), Mexico (90 6%), Canada (89 8%), 
and France (89 3%) The UK, Germany, and Australia were at the 
other end of the spectrum, with 81 4%, 72 6%, and 62 5% of 
their organizations being compromised, respectively (see Figure 
4\) Maybe the Aussies know something Not only was Australia 
the only country where less than 70% of organizations were 
breached at least once, but only 20 9% of the organizations

Figure 5: Percentage indicating compromise is “more likely to occur 
than not” in the next 12 months.

Expectations about successful cyberattacks over the coming 12 
months reached a new high in this year’s survey The number of 
respondents indicating that such an attack was either “somewhat 
likely” or “very likely” edged up from 75 6% to 76 1% In addition, 
the mix between those two views shifted for the worse The 
percentage saying a successful attack was “very likely” jumped 
by 3 1%, to 35 1% That is four times the number (8 5%) who 
gave that response eight years ago when this survey started (see 
Figure 5\) 

The best we can say is that the rate of increase in the combined 
total has slowed to half a percentage point in this survey, after 
having jumped 2 9%, 4 1%, and 6 3% in the 2019, 2020, and 2021 
CDRs, respectively We think the curve has flattened because 
organizations have spent the last two years putting in place 
infrastructure and processes to protect remote operations, 
home\-based workers, and personal devices (i e , devices not 
managed by the IT department) Examples of such measures 
include bring\-your\-own\-device (BYOD) policies and zero trust 
network access (ZTNA) approaches to network and application 
access (see pages 52 and 54\) Those investments are giving 
security teams greater confidence in their ability to manage the 
challenges created by the COVID\-19 pandemic 

It is interesting to note that the 76 1% of respondents indicating 
that a successful attack is somewhat or very likely in the 
coming 12 months is less than the 85 3% who experienced 
such an attack in the past year In other words, at least some 
security professionals who were victimized last year think their 
organizations are better able to defend themselves this year Or 
else they are just optimistic A positive attitude is healthy, when 
not taken to extremes Perhaps we should all follow the example 
of Benjamin Disraeli, the 19th century British prime minister, who 
said: “I am prepared for the worst, but hope for the best ”

Security Posture by IT Domain

On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate your organization’s overall security posture 
(ability to defend against cyberthreats) in each of the following IT components:

Cloud applications (SaaS)

Servers (physical and virtual)

Datastores (file servers, databases, SANs)

Laptops / notebooks

Websites and web appliations

Application Containers

Cloud infrastructure (IaaS, PaaS)

Desktops (PCs)

Network perimeter / DMZ (public web servers)

Application program interfaces (APIs)

Internet of Things (IoT)

Industrial control systems (ICS) / SCADA devices

Mobile devices (smartphones, tablets)

Each year we try to gauge how security professionals feel about 
their ability to defend against cyberthreats across different types 
of systems, technologies, and environments This information 
gives us a picture of the IT domains where they are most 
confident, and those that are creating the most headaches (see 
Figure 8\) 

This year respondents chose software as a service (SaaS) cloud 
applications as the area where they are most comfortable about 
their organization’s security posture SaaS moved up from third 
position in the previous two surveys Clearly, SaaS vendors have 
done a good job of staying on top of security issues (or at least 
are perceived that way by their customers)

Respondents are also confident about physical and virtual 
servers, as well as datastores such as file servers, databases, and 
SANs These are always at or near the top of the list because they 
are mostly located in data centers under the direct observation 
and control of operations and security staffs 

Laptops and notebooks joined the top tier, in fourth position, 
moving up from eighth in the previous survey In fact, this area 
had the largest year\-to\-year increase in security posture ratings, 
from 4 01 last time (on a scale of 1 to 5\) to 4 11 in this one We 
believe this reflects all the attention and effort over the past 
two years that has gone into better protection for remote and 
home workers in response to COVID\-19 On page 52 we discuss 
technologies and architectures that are enabling employees to 
securely work from home 

The IT domain that most concerns respondents is mobile devices 
such as smartphones and tablets A big part of the problem is 
that COVID has increased the business use of mobile devices 
owned by employees These cannot easily be updated, locked 
down, or even monitored by their employers, and are therefore 
less defended and more vulnerable to attacks A multi\-sponsor 
survey report published by CyberEdge in 2020, “The Impact of 
COVID\-19 on Enterprise IT Security Teams Report,” showed a 
nearly 60% leap in the number of organizations implementing 
BYOD policies in response to the new pandemic reality Clearly, 
IT security teams continue to be nervous about securing 
employee\-owned mobile devices 

The next two greatest areas of concern are “manufacturing and 
operational technology (OT),” which includes categories such 
as industrial control system (ICS) and supervisory control and 
data acquisition (SCADA) systems, and devices that make up 
the emerging internet of things (IoT) These are areas with large 
numbers of devices that were never designed with security 
in mind They are also being targeted by state\-sponsored and 
criminal hacking groups, with a few well\-publicized incidents 
related to international conflicts and blackmail 

“Laptops and notebooks joined the top tier, 

in fourth position, moving up from eighth in the 

previous survey… We believe this reflects the 

attention and effort over the past two years that 

has gone into better protection for remote 
and home workers ”

Application programming interfaces (APIs), which were in the 
middle of the pack last year, have now emerged as fourth\-
highest area of concern As organizations move to modular 
services\-based cloud applications, APIs become more tempting 
targets for threat actors Protecting APIs is likely to become an 
even bigger issue over the next few years We will have more to 
say about this later in this report (pages 40 and 59\) 

One final observation: the security posture ratings increased 
from last year in every single category This fact shows that 
organizations are feeling a little bit better about the defenses 
they have in place to stop cyberthreats Perhaps this is an early 
sign that security teams are finally catching up with threat actors 
in their ongoing arms race

Assessing IT Security Functions

On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate the adequacy of your organization’s capabilities 
(people and processes) in each of the following functional areas of IT security:

Governance, risk and compliance (GRC)

Identity and access management (IAM)

Detection of advanced / sophisticated threats

Application development and 
testing (SDLC, DevSecOps)

Incident investigation and response

Security engineering / architecture and design

Brand protection

Cyber risk quantification and reporting

Detection of rogue insiders / insider attacks

Third\-party risk management (TPRM)

User security awareness / education

Attack surface reduction 
(patch management, pen testing)

This question asks respondents to rate the adequacy of their 
organization’s capabilities in different functional areas of 
IT security The answers show us perceived strengths and 
weaknesses in security\-related processes and programs (see 
Figure 9\) 

Organizations remain most positive about their capabilities for 
governance, risk and compliance (GRC) and identity and access 
management (IAM) These are followed closely by detection of 
advanced threats and application development and testing, 
two areas where many organizations have made considerable 
investments in the past couple of years

However, respondents were somewhat less upbeat about their 
organization’s processes for security engineering, architecture, 
and design That function was at the top of the list in the 
previous survey, but fell to sixth place in this one 

The area of greatest concern is attack surface reduction, which 
includes disciplines such as patch management, vulnerability 
management, penetration testing, and security configuration 
management Attack surfaces have been expanding as workers 
use more mobile and personal devices in less\-protected settings, 
and access applications hosted in a greater variety of cloud 
environments Finding and fixing vulnerabilities across all these 
areas will be a growing challenge for the foreseeable future 

User security awareness and education is another significant 
challenge Threat actors continue to develop ingenious phishing 
and social engineering campaigns to acquire valid credentials, 
plant malware, and otherwise leverage human weaknesses to 
further their malicious activities As we will see on page 24, low 
security awareness among employees is now the second\-most 
serious barrier to establishing effective defenses against 
cyberthreats (after a lack of skilled security personnel) 

Another problematic functional area is third\-party risk 
management (TPRM) It is very difficult to monitor, much less 
improve, the security practices of suppliers and other third 
parties that have access to an organization’s applications and 
data The press continues to report major data breaches that 
originate from credentials and PII captured from third parties and 
from vulnerabilities and misconfiguration in vendors’ software 
and systems 

“The area of greatest concern is attack 

surface reduction Attack surfaces have been 

expanding Finding and fixing vulnerabilities 

across all these areas will continue to be a 

growing challenge for the foreseeable future ”

We introduced a new functional area in this year’s survey: cyber 
risk quantification and reporting We see many organizations 
devoting more time and resources to these activities recently 
This trend is driven in a large part by the need to justify security 
investments to top executives and boards of directors, and to 
show progress toward security program goals The data shows 
this area falling in the middle range as far as adequacy of 
capabilities 

We should note that our survey was conducted in November 
2021, just before the Log4j security vulnerabilities came to light 
Undoubtedly, concerns about functions like attack surface 
reduction and application testing have intensified considerably 
since then

Just like last year, the greatest unfilled demand is for security 
administrators, who have the critical job of installing, configuring, 
and maintaining security tools and infrastructure Four out of 
10 organizations (40 1%) can’t find enough (see Figure 10\) 

One in three organizations can’t find enough IT security analysts, 
operators, or incident responders (33 2%) The shortfall was 
slightly less than in the previous survey, when it was 35 0% 
Almost one\-third of organizations are short of IT security 
architects and engineers (32 4%), essentially the same as a 
year ago 

Rounding out the roles were application security testers (28 5%), 
DevSecOps engineers (28 0%), and risk and fraud analysts 
(24 0%) The deficit of application security testers and DevSecOps 
engineers worsened from the previous survey, probably the 
result of a turn toward building security into applications rather 
than relying entirely on perimeter defenses

Figure 13: Relative concern for cyberthreats, by type.

What types of threats are keeping security professionals up 
at night? For the seventh year in a row, malware tops the list 
(see Figure 13\) That’s not remarkable, since malware is a key 
component of most digital skimming, ransomware, phishing, 
and targeted attacks, among others, and threat actors continue 
to come up with new techniques that allow malware to evade 
detection 

The surprise in this data is that account takeover (ATO) and 
credential abuse attacks (which include credential stuffing) 
moved up from fourth place last year to second place in 
this survey, slightly ahead of ransomware (!) and just behind 
malware In fact, the average concern rating for this type of 
attack increased the most of any of the 12 categories on this list, 
rising 08 from 3 89 to 3 97 (on a scale of 1 to 5\) The increase was 
driven by an upsurge in concern among finance and financial 
services companies, and to a lesser extent among manufacturing 
and telecom and technology companies 

2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report

Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrent Security PosturePerceptions and ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices and StrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 2: Perceptions and Concerns

Of course, ransomware is also near the top of the list, in third 
position and just a tad behind ATO attacks The average concern 
rating for ransomware increased 04 from last year, also a pretty 
big one\-year jump Clearly this was fueled by increased coverage 
of ransomware attacks in the press (e g , Colonial Pipeline), 
demands for larger ransom payments, and the emergence of 
“double extortion ransomware attacks” (see page 21\) 

In fact, based on current trends, we expect the level of concern 
about account takeover and ransomware attacks to pull even 
with or pass malware on this list in the next year or two 

We also want to note the rising anxiety about attacks on brand 
and reputation in social media and on the web The concern 
rating for that category rose 07, the second\-largest increase this 
year, lifting it from 11th to 5th position on the list We believe 
the increase is due both to more activity by threat actors (such 
as typosquatting and hijacking social media accounts) and the 
recognition that this issue belongs to IT security teams as well as 
marketing and social media groups within the enterprise 

Respondents were least concerned about zero\-day attacks, 
drive\-by downloads, and watering hole attacks However, as we 
mentioned earlier, the survey was conducted before the Log4j 
story broke As a result of that vulnerability, zero\-day attacks may 
move up a bit in next year’s report 

Every year we average the ratings across all categories to create 
a “Threat Concern Index” (see Figure 14\) That index remains at 
a record high of 3 88 As we mentioned earlier, gale\-force winds 
continue to blow in the world of cybersecurity

This year, harvesting of personally identifiable information (PII) 
rose to the top of the list, edging out ATO and credential stuffing 
attacks The number of respondents concerned about these 
attacks jumped almost 7% percent from last year, from 39 7% 
to 46 6% PII harvesting often involves hiding code in JavaScript 
that captures financial and personal data, including credentials 
from forms on users’ browsers The data and credentials are 
sent to a server controlled by threat actors, who can use them 
to access user accounts, strengthen phishing attacks, steal 
identities, and perform other malicious activities In our survey, 
more than half of all respondents in education, aerospace and 
defense, finance, entertainment, and healthcare were particularly 
worried about PII harvesting 

The share of organizations concerned about ATO and credential 
stuffing attacks also increased from the previous survey, from 
43 7% to 45 5% Next in line are carding and payment fraud 
attacks (39 6%) and digital skimming and Magecart attacks 
(33 2%) Less common, but still affecting a significant number 
of organizations, are denial of inventory attacks (24 6%) and 
hoarding attacks (20 4%) 

The vast majority of organizations in this survey are concerned 
about attacks on web and mobile applications Nine out of 10 
respondents (90 3%) indicated concerns about one or more of 
the attacks on the list (see Figure 16\) 

The numbers were particularly high in Spain (98 0%), China (also 
98 0%), and Japan (95 6%) (see Figure 17\) The lowest levels of

Responding to Ransomware 

If victimized by ransomware in the past 12 months, did your organization pay a ransom 
(using Bitcoins or other anonymous currency) to recover data? 

2021 saw a lot of big developments in the ransomware industry 
(and yes, today ransomware is an industry, with hundreds 
of millions of dollars in revenue and large, highly structured 
organizations) Some of the more noteworthy:

 Very high\-visibility attacks affected hundreds or thousands of 
people, including attacks on the Colonial Pipeline (which cut 
off fuel delivery to 10,000 gas stations in the eastern United 
States), the giant meatpacker JBS (which created shortages 
of meat products in several US states), and Ireland’s Health 
Service Executive (which disrupted healthcare services across 
Ireland) 

 “Double extortion” ransomware attacks emerged as a major 
threat type; now ransomware gangs exfiltrate a copy of data 
before encrypting it, then threaten victims with exposure of 
sensitive information as well as data loss 

 The average size of ransomware payments increased 

significantly 

 National governments and international agencies finally 

started to crack down on major ransomware gangs (notably 
Russia’s takedown of the REvil organization) and to push 
government and commercial organizations to harden their 
environments, disclose more information about attacks, and 
work closely with law enforcement groups 

What data do we have about ransomware attacks? 

The percentage of companies victimized by a ransomware 
attack in the past 12 months set a new record (see Figure 18\) 
That figure rose from 55 1% in our 2018 report, to 62 4% two 
years ago, to 68 5% last year, to 71 0% now Threat actors 
continue to expand their activities, and no wonder: for most 
of them ransomware campaigns represent “easy money,” with 
rising revenue from each attack (see Figure 19\) and little chance

of punishment In addition, more bad actors can participate by 
leveraging the growing number of “ransomware\-as\-a\-service” 
businesses that provide infrastructure to launch and manage 
ransomware attacks 

The percentage of organizations that paid ransoms also 
increased substantially, from 57 0% in our last survey to 62 9% 
now (see the middle section of Figure 20\) This rise reflects 
several trends, including added pressure from data exfiltration 
and the threat of data exposure 

Another factor is a cycle we have described in previous reports: 
ransomware gangs have noted that when they are conscientious 
about helping victims recover their data, other victims are more 
likely to pay ransoms, which increases the profits of the gangs 
and creates a greater incentive to launch more campaigns Our 
data shows this cycle in action (see Figure 20\) Over the past two 
years the percentage of ransom payers who recovered their data 
rose 3 4% from 68 8% to 72 2%, creating a tendency for more 
victimized companies to pay ransoms, up 5 4% over two years, 
and leading to more attacks, up 8 6% during the same period

Figure 20: The ransomware vicious cycle: increased odds of recovering data … entice more victims to pay ransoms … which motivates more

Figure 21 provides more evidence that ransomware 
gangs operate like profit\-maximizing businesspeople who 
rationally assess opportunities and risks Our data shows that 

medium\-large and large organizations, with 5,000\-9,999 and 
10,000\-24,999 employees, respectively, are most likely to be 
victimized by ransomware (73 5% and 74 7%, respectively)

organizations with 500\-999 employees, victimized at a rate of

to pay higher ransoms But then why would enterprises with 
more than 25,000 employees, which presumably could afford 
the largest payments, be victimized at the (relatively) low rate 
of 67 0%? As the ransomware gangs acknowledged publicly, 
taking out a big piece of someone’s economy or shutting down 
essential infrastructure is bad for business because it attracts 
too much attention from national governments and law 
enforcement agencies

Figure 24: Inhibitors to establishing effective cyberthreat defenses.

Agile software development teams hold daily “standup” 
meetings where each person briefly answers three questions:

1 What did you do yesterday?

2 What will you do today?

3 What impediments are blocking your progress?

Most of this report explores the answers security professionals 
give about their current practices and their plans for the coming 
12 months This question focuses on the equally important third 
query: what is inhibiting your organization from adequately 
defending itself against cyberthreats? And by implication, what 
could be changed to make you more successful?

For the third year running, the top two impediments have been 
lack of skilled personnel and low security awareness among 
employees (see Figure 24\)

Figure 25: Security Concern Index, depicting the average rating 
of security inhibitors.

As we saw on page 15, five out of six organizations have not 
been able to recruit enough skilled IT security personnel And 
we know that COVID\-19 has put additional strain on existing 
professionals in the field They have to defend an ever\-expanding 
attack surface, and today many do so from home, without 
the resources of a physical operations center This question 
highlights the impact of those factors Not only is lack of skilled 
personnel the \#1 inhibitor to effective cyberthreat defenses, 
but the average rating for this issue increased by 04 from last 
year, more than any other item on this list Our hats are off to the 
dedicated professionals who have stepped up their workloads 
despite disruption to their personal lives 

Low security awareness among employees is the second\-
highest impediment to security Coincidentally (or perhaps 
not), Figure 9 on page 13 shows that user security awareness 
is the IT security function with the second\-to\-lowest rating for 
adequate organizational capabilities Threat actors continue to 
see employees as the weakest link in defenses, susceptible to 
phishing campaigns, social engineering attacks, business email 
compromise (BEC) attacks, and other techniques that play on 
human (rather than technical) weaknesses Deep fakes and the 
availability of personal details on social media are likely to make 
it even easier to hoodwink employees A few organizations 
have begun to take aggressive measures to improve security 
awareness, such as ongoing security training and simulated 
phishing and social engineering attacks, but clearly not enough 
is being done to educate employees 

The next tier of issues are poor integration and interoperability 
between security solutions, lack of management support, and 
too much data to analyze 

The inhibitors at the bottom of the list? Lack of effective solutions 
available in the market and lack of budget New security 
technologies continue to come onstream, and organizations are 
willing to pay for them The constraint is finding enough people 
with the right skills to evaluate, deploy, integrate, and manage 
them 

We have averaged the ratings across all categories to create a 
“Security Concern Index” (see Figure 25\) That index remains at a 
near\-peak level of 3 64 While some inhibitors have become less 
irksome than in previous years, others have become even more 
problematic

Benefits of Unified App and Data Security Defenses

Which of the following have been the biggest benefits of leveraging a unified platform for application and 
data security defenses (e g , WAF, DDoS protection, RASP, API security, data risk analytics, database security)? 
(Select up to three )

Improved cloud security posture

55\.5%

Enhanced security incident investigations

Improved customer support experience

48\.4%

45\.8%

Simplified security rules management

43\.6%

Fewer third\-party integrations to manage

Figure 26: Benefits achieved by unifying application and data security defenses.

When it comes to sourcing related technologies, security 
professionals are often faced with a choice between a 
multiple\-source, best\-of\-breed approach and a single\-source, 
integrated solution approach The former offers the widest 
choice of features across the different areas, but usually 
involves extra costs and hassles related to integration (or lack 
of it), incompatible management and reporting tools, and the 
complexity of working with more vendors 

In this question we asked respondents about the benefits of 
leveraging a unified platform for application and data security 
defenses (see Figure 26\) 

Of the organizations that have implemented this type of 
integrated platform, more than half cite the overall benefit of 
an improved cloud security posture, and nearly half identified 
enhanced security incident investigations An integrated solution 
gives security professionals confidence that the different 
technologies work together and that information won’t fall 
through the cracks between them

Respondents also highlighted an improved customer support 
experience and simplified security rules management These 
are functions of better information sharing and working with 
a single, consistent set of security policies Roughly one\-third 
of the respondents also pointed to easier management of 
third\-party integrations as a major benefit 

The fact that all five benefits were cited by at least 30 percent of 
the respondents indicates that a unified platform for application 
and data security is one of those areas in cybersecurity where 
integration and single\-vendor sourcing just make sense

When organizations transition applications to cloud platforms, 
they don’t have to worry about managing the underlying 
infrastructure The move can even simplify security – if an 
organization does all of its work on one platform But in reality, 
the vast majority of organizations do some of their work on each 
of several platforms These include physical and virtual servers in 
their own data centers, in private clouds, and in multiple public 
cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft 
Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba Cloud, and IBM Cloud 

We added a question to our survey this year to get a handle on the 
challenges created by hybrid cloud environments (see Figure 27\) 

The top two issues selected by the respondents were detecting 
unauthorized application usage (46 4%) and detecting and 
responding to cyberthreats (45 3%) While every server type and 
platform has tools for detecting issues and alerting on incidents, 
there is no standardization and little or no out\-of\-the\-box 
integration Security professionals are left with the soul\-crushing 
work of collecting and analyzing inconsistent data, filtering out 
duplicates and false negatives, responding using multiple tools, etc

The third\- and fourth\-place challenges are accessing and inspecting 
multi\-cloud traffic (40 0%) and accessing and inspecting container 
traffic (32 5%) These two are also related to inconsistent data 
across environments and the need for multiple tools, sometimes 
compounded by the need to manage multiple permissions and 
credentials to access different systems and platforms 

Coming just behind, but still important to almost a third of the 
respondents, are challenges related to maintaining regulatory 
compliance (30 7%) and meeting internal service level objectives 
(30 0%) 

How many organizations in fact face these challenges? A lot A 
full 96% of the respondents in our survey indicated that they are 
dealing with a hybrid cloud environment

Figure 28: Types of specialty cybersecurity professional certifications deemed most beneficial to IT security career paths.

For knowledge workers, continuing education is essential 
for getting and keeping good jobs At least, that is the 
overwhelming opinion of the respondents to our survey Except 
for a few holdouts (1% of the sample \- probably people already 
planning their retirement party), virtually all respondents said 
that at least one cybersecurity certification would be beneficial 
for their career (see Figure 28\) 

The top two choices, both selected by more than half of the 
respondents, are certifications for cloud security (55 3%) and 
for software security (53 2%) These are both growth areas As 
enterprises migrate more and more application processing to 
cloud platforms, demand for cloud security expertise is likely 
to grow and grow Similarly, many organizations are working 
on building security into their applications (as opposed to 
detecting evidence of attacks and compromises after they are 
in production) People who understand application security and 
DevSecOps practices don’t have to worry about job security

Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrent Security PosturePerceptions and ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices and StrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 2: Perceptions and Concerns

The next most beneficial certification is for security administration 
(43 9%) Security administrators are the backbone of many security 
teams, where they install, configure, and maintain security tools 
and infrastructure As shown in Figure 10 on page 15, there are 
more vacancies for security administrators than for any other 
security role 

“Demand for cloud security expertise is likely 

to grow and grow People who understand 

application security and DevSecOps practices 

don’t have to worry about job security ”

In fact, interest in all three of these certifications took big jumps 
from last year to this one: up 4 1% for cloud security, 3 2% for 
software security, and 5 6% for security administration 

The next two types of certification are of most interest to people 
making career moves Fundamental skills and knowledge (22 6%) 
helps people entering IT security or eager to fill gaps in their 
basic knowledge of the field, while leadership and operations 
(21 9%) is for security professionals who want to move into 
security management roles 

Rounding out the field are certifications for three specialized 
areas: security engineering (18 7%), authorization (18 6%), and 
architecture (16 5%)

Figure 29: Percentage of IT budget allocated to information security, 
by year.

For the last five years we have asked respondents what 
percentage of their organization’s overall IT budget is allocated 
to information security After rapid growth between the 2018 
and 2020 surveys, the amount has leveled off in the 12 7% to 
12 8% range (see Figure 29\) 

Why has the curve flattened out, when dangerous threats 
continue to emerge and cybersecurity has become more 
visible to top management and boards of directors? And when 
the COVID\-19 pandemic has placed more stress on security 
processes and staffs? We think four factors are at work:

1 

2 

 Many of the expenses required to support the wave of new 
remote workers created by COVID\-19 involved non\-security 
items such as more laptops and mobile devices, more 
network capacity, and additional help desk support 

 As shown on Figure 24 on page 24, the gating factor in 
providing better security is finding personnel with security 
skills, not budget; it doesn’t make sense to throw more 
money at security if you don’t have the people to deploy and 
use new technologies or equipment

 More organizations are outsourcing security tasks that used 
to be performed in their data centers to cloud platform 
providers and MSSPs (see page 46\) 

 Some organizations are “sidesourcing” security activities (we are 
coining a new term here, meaning delegating tasks to other 
groups in the same enterprise) by training software developers 
to build security into their code and end users to recognize and 
report phishing, social engineering, and other attacks

“Why has the curve flattened out, when 

dangerous threats continue to emerge and 

cybersecurity has become more visible ? 

We think four factors are at work ”

These factors lead organizations to invest more in security, but 
the additional spending doesn’t show up in the security group’s 
budget 

We welcome the fact that security no longer takes bigger bites 
out of the IT budget Some might want to see growth in the 
relative size of the security “empire,” but that growth is not 
sustainable in the long term 

Turning to the global picture, three countries allocate 15% or 
more of IT budgets to security: Brazil (15 6%), Turkey (15 3%), 
and Saudi Arabia (15 0%) Also towards the high end of the scale 
are the United States (13 7%) and China (13 6%) Three countries 
allocate less than 11%: Australia (10 9%), Germany (10 8%), and 
France (10 7%) (see Figure 30\) 

Among major industries, the largest allocations are from telecom 
and technology and finance (both 13 3%), while the lowest are 
from education (10 7%) and government (10 6%) (see Figure 31\) 

From a size perspective, the smallest organizations (500\-999 
employees) and the largest (10,000\-24,999 and more than 
25,000\) allocate 13% or more Mid\-sized organizations spend 
slightly less: 12 7% for organizations with 1,000\-4,999 employees, 
and 11 9% for those with 5,000\-9,999 (see Figure 32\)

Figure 33: Percentage of organizations with rising security budgets.

The previous question examined security spending as a 
percentage of the overall IT budget This question looks at 
whether security spending is rising or falling in absolute terms 

It’s mostly rising (see Figure 33\) Of the organizations in the 
survey, 83 2% are predicting a budget increase this year (versus 
7 1% that are predicting a decline and 9 7% that expect their 
budget to stay about the same) Those statistics are pretty 
consistent with results from the past few years, with the 
exception of 2021, when the COVID\-19 pandemic prevented 
budget increases in slightly more organizations than usual 

The average increase in security budgets has been fairly steady, 
ranging between 4 0% and 5 0% for the past five years (see 
Figure 34\) The average expectation is for budgets to rise a 
healthy 4 6% this year If you work in cybersecurity, ask for a raise!

On a country\-by\-country basis, respondents from Brazil and 
Turkey are expecting the largest budget increases, 6 7% and 
6 5%, respectively (see Figure 35\) Interestingly, they also report 
the largest allocations of their organization’s IT budgets this year 
(see Figure 30 on page 32\) The smallest increases are forecast for 
the United Kingdom (3 8%), Italy (3 7%), Canada (also 3 7%), and 
Germany (3 2%) 

Respondents from five of the seven major industries are expecting 
increases of around 5% (see Figure 36\) They are: manufacturing 
(5 3%), telecom and technology (4 9%), finance (also 4 9%), retail 
(4 8%), and education (4 7%) But the projected increases are 
below 4% for government (3 9%) and healthcare (3 6%) 

The expected increases for small, medium, and large organizations 
all fall within a band of 4 2% to 5 5% (see Figure 37\)

There is no shortage of innovative new security products being 
brought to market According to the Crunchbase website, in 
2021 venture capitalists invested $20 billion in cybersecurity 
startups, including a record\-smashing $7 8 billion in the fourth 
quarter And as we saw in Figure 24 on page 24, “lack of effective 
solutions available in the market” tied for second\-to\-last place in 
a list of factors that inhibit defense against cyberthreats Nobody 
is worried about having too few options 

But while an abundance is better than a dearth, it does make 
prioritization more difficult We want to help In this question 
and the next four, we throw light on what your peers think What 
cybersecurity offerings are must\-haves? Which are the up\-and\-
comers they plan to acquire to address emerging threats? Are 
some failing to generate much interest?

So, while advanced malware and sandboxing remain a “must\-
have” technology, four other network security technologies 
are also found in 55% or more of organizations Installations 
of all four grew substantially since the previous survey They 
are: intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS), up 4 4% 
to 56 2%; secure email gateway (SEG), up 2 8% to 56 1%; data 
loss/leak prevention (DLP), up 1 5% to 55 0%; and secure web 
gateway (SWG), up 3 3% to 55 0% These technologies use a 
variety of methods to detect anomolous network behaviors, as 
well as content and hyperlinks that may be related to malicious 
activities 

The next three network security technologies on our list are in 
use at more than half of organizations: network access control 
(NAC), at 54 4%; denial of service (DoS/DDos) prevention, at 
53 9%; and SSL/TLS decryption appliances and platforms, at 
51 8% 

Lined up for new installations or upgrades in the coming 12 
months: next\-generation firewall (NGFW) technology (planned 
for acquisition by 40 3% or organizations), network behavior 
analysis (NBA) and netflow analysis (37 5%), and deception 
technology and distributed honeypots (37 1%) We think the last 
type of technology is especially interesting since it can be used 
to catch threat actors “in the act” without exposing real networks 
or data 

Now let’s see what endpoint security technologies are exciting 
your peers (page 38\) 

On this and the following tables, the first column shows the 
percentage of organizations that are currently using each 
technology The middle column depicts organizations that 
are planning to acquire the technology this year The last 
column represents organizations that aren’t sure they need the 
technology To make the results easier to absorb, we color\-coded 
the cells Dark blue highlights technologies that are widely used 
now or are most likely to be deployed soon Lighter shades 
indicate lower adoption levels and fewer planned acquisitions 
The cells with the “no plans” figures are gray 

“While advanced malware and sandboxing 

remain a ‘must have’ technology, four other 

network security technologies are also found 

in 55% or more of organizations ”

We start by examining network security technologies (see Table 1\) 
For the last several years, the one that has been most widely 
used is advanced malware detection and sandboxing (in use in 
59 7% or organizations) The ubiquity of this technology (or really, 
group of technologies) is not surprising, given that malware 
concerns our respondents more than any other type of threat 
(as shown in Figure 13 on page 17\) 

However, this area is subject to a continuous arms race Vendors 
compile more malware signatures; threat actors use obfuscation 
and polymorphism to disguise files Vendors use sandboxing to 
detect malicious behaviors; the bad guys figure out how to delay 
malicious activities until after the sandboxes stop detecting 
Vendors use AI to identify suspicious activities; attackers manage 
to prevent the anti\-malware software from running Move and 
countermove

Table 2: Endpoint security technologies in use and planned for acquisition.

Table 2 provides insights into the deployment status and 
acquisition plans for endpoint security technologies As with 
Table 1, percentages in dark blue indicate a higher frequency 
of adoption and greater likelihood of acquisition, while lighter 
blues correspond to less\-popular options 

In this survey we made a significant change to our endpoint 
security technology categories, replacing “advanced anti\-virus” 
with endpoint protection platform (EPP) and endpoint detection 
and response (EDR) This update reflects the evolution of this 
technology area and current industry terminology 

The most widely installed endpoint security technology 
continues to be basic anti\-virus and anti\-malware solutions 
based primarily on threat signatures Despite continued reports 
that “anti\-virus is dead,” old but still dangerous viruses and 
Trojans continue to circulate, and security groups see value 
in products that detect and block them That may be why the 
percentage of organizations currently using this technology 
actually increased 3 7%, from 70 5% in the previous survey to 
74 2% in this one 

Broadly speaking, EPP products provide traditional anti\-virus 
features enhanced by an array of newer capabilities such as 
machine learning, endpoint activity monitoring, and sandboxing 
Collectively, they overcome many of the tricks and techniques 
malware developers use to evade detection EDR solutions 
may include certain EPP features, but they also offer tools to 
help security teams aggregate and analyze endpoint data and 
respond to campaigns that involve malware

The other technologies in use at more than half of the surveyed 
organizations are data loss or lead prevention (DLP), at 56 6%, 
and disk encryption, at 53 3% 

The endpoint security solution most often planned for 
acquisition in the coming year is deception technology and 
honeypots As we mentioned in reference to network security, 
this can be used to catch threat actors in the act without 
exposing sensitive data This solution not only prevents data 
breaches in the short run, it also derails and misinforms attackers 
and collects intelligence on the tactics, techniques, and 
procedures (TTPs) of threat actors There is also a psychological 
element: many security organizations welcome the chance to 
gain an advantage over attackers instead of always being at a 
disadvantage 

Now it’s time to explore application\- and data\-centric security 
technologies (see page 40\) 

“Our respondents reported EDR solutions in 

use at 57 6% of organizations, and EPP 

products installed at 55 3% These numbers 

suggest that many organizations use both 

EDR and EPP technologies – and basic anti\-virus 
packages as well – on their endpoints ”

organizations, and EPP products installed at 55 3% These 
numbers suggest that many organizations use both EDR and EPP 
technologies – and basic anti\-virus packages as well – on their

What endpoint technology had the biggest jump in usage 
during the past year? That would be browser or internet isolation 
and micro\-virtualization products Installations leaped 6 9%, 
from 48 2% to 55 1% Instead of viewing web pages and running 
scripts and apps in browsers on their own systems, end users 
run them in a virtual browser on a cloud platform Malware can’t 
spread to the users’ systems, and suspicious activities can be 
observed in the cloud This technology has a great deal of appeal 
for organizations where remote work and cloud applications are 
expanding

In the area of application and data security, the most popular 
offering continues to be API gateway and protection products 
(see Table 3\) Usage of these technologies has soared over the 
last few years, rising from 45 1% in our 2018 report to 64 1% 
today API gateways enforce authorization and encryption 
policies, scale resources when traffic spikes, and perform rate 
limiting to mitigate DDoS attacks and other forms of abuse 
API protection solutions provide security teams with tools 
to understand, detect, and respond to attacks targeting APIs 
by performing tasks such as mapping the attack surface to 

uncover rogue and forgotten APIs, blocking injection attacks 
and other exploits, analyzing attacker behaviors, and correlating 
API\-related data across hybrid and multi\-cloud environments 

As we mentioned in our discussion of security posture by IT 
domain on page 12, protecting APIs has become an increasingly 
pressing area of concern As more organizations move to 
modular, services\-based cloud applications, more sensitive 
data is being accessed through APIs, which are becoming more 
tempting targets for threat actors We think API protection will 
become an even bigger area of focus in coming years

Two other must haves are web application firewalls (WAFs), at 
61 1%, and database firewalls, at 59 5% These technologies have 
proved themselves in preventing unauthorized access to web 
applications and databases 

Other application and data security solutions that showed 
significant growth in installations over the past year are file 
activity and activity monitoring (FIM/FAM), up 3 3% to 50 2%; 
runtime application self\-protection (RASP), up 2 2% to 50 4%; 
and application delivery controllers (ADCs), up 1 8% to 52 2% 

The number\-one technology for upcoming purchases is bot 
management, planned for acquisition in 39 8% of organizations 
It helps defend websites and mobile applications from the 
many types of attacks that utilize bot networks, including DDoS 
attacks, phishing and spam campaigns, credential stuffing, brute 
force password cracking, content scraping, and click fraud

Security management and operations technologies support a 
number of activities that make security programs effective and 
reliable, including:

We added two new categories to our survey this year, and they 
immediately occupied the top two spots in terms of installations 
(see Table 3\)! 

 Providing basic security hygiene and reducing the attack 

surface

 Automating security\-related processes

 Collecting, analyzing, and reporting on security data to 
identify weaknesses, respond to breaches, and prioritize 
investments 

 Testing security defenses using the techniques of likely 

attackers 

Active Directory protection is already in use in almost two\-thirds 
of organizations (64 5%) For many, Microsoft Active Directory 
is the single source of truth for information about employee 
and business partner identities, as well as a repository for 
information on group membership and privileged access It 
is also a critical resource for implementing ZTNA concepts 
Therefore organizations must protect Active Directory from 
cybercriminals attempting to create new accounts, escalate 
privileges, circumvent network segmentation, and otherwise 
gain unauthorized access to networks and applications

Cyber risk management and reporting, currently used in 58 0% 
of organizations, helps align security activities with business risks 
and needs It also helps IT groups justify investments in security 
professionals, processes, and technologies to top management 
and boards of directors 

Other security management technologies that are widely in use 
include security configuration management, or SCM (employed 
in 56 5% of organizations), patch management (54 7%), and 
security information and event management, or SIEM (51 7%) 

One of the leaders in year\-over\-year growth was penetration 
testing and attack simulation The percentage of organizations 
using it increased 2 8%, to 50 7% We think the use of penetration 
testing and attack simulation will continue to grow, along with 
practices such as red team exercises and bug bounty contests As 
many organizations place more emphasis on developing secure 
applications, they are recognizing that some application security 
issues can only be uncovered by thinking like an attacker 

Our data for threat intelligence platform (TIP) or service adoption 
is interesting Of all the options in the security management and 
operations section, this technology had:

1 The biggest year\-to\-year increase in usage, up 3 3% to 46 3%

2 The highest planned for acquisition number, 39 7%

In the past, we have rarely seen that combination Threat 
intelligence helps organizations validate and prioritize security 
alerts more quickly and accurately, focus on the threats most 
likely to affect their specific industry and systems, and better 
understand threat actor TTPs Our data about TIP indicates a 
growing appreciation of threat intelligence and the advantages 
it provides 

“On this year’s application and data security 

shopping list, a new CDR entrant, bot 

management, takes the top spot (40 4%) ”

The other technologies with high planned for acquisition 
percentages are advanced security analytics (also 39 7%), 
user and entity behavior analysis (38 9%), and vulnerability 
assessment and management (38 8%) 

And now, on to our final category: identity and access 
management, or IAM (see page 44\)

Table 5: Identity and access management technologies in use and planned for acquisition.

Identity and access management (IAM) is not the most 
glamorous segment of information security It involves a number 
of cutting\-edge technologies, but also a lot of operational, 
administrative, and support tasks related to roles, permissions, 
account provisioning and deprovioning, password resets, access 
controls, etc , etc 

Yet today, as never before, organizations need to perform these 
tasks quickly and accurately, with maximum security but the 
least possible annoyance to users and minimum disruption to 
business processes That’s because more and more business 
is being done with web and mobile applications, which 
lead employees and customers to expect consumer\-level 
convenience, but in an environment where nobody can be 
trusted to be who they say they are (hence “zero trust” practices) 

Who says IAM is increasingly important? Well, our data does 
Since our last survey, organizations increased their use of 
nine out of the 10 technology categories listed in Table 5 The 
percentage using two of the categories increased 7 5%, which 
is more than any technology in any of our other tables IAM is 
not the most glamorous segment of information security, but in 
some respects it is getting the most attention 

The use of password management and automated reset, the 
most widely deployed IAM technology, increased by 7 5% year 
over year, to 62 1% It automates a very basic set of tasks, but 
provides a big payoff in both user satisfaction and time savings 
for IT support staff and administrators

“IAM is not the most glamorous segment 

of information security, but in some respects 

it is getting the most attention ”

Adaptive and risk\-based authentication was up 5 5% this year, on 
top of 4 9% growth last year, to reach 61 8% of organizations It 
balances security and convenience by ensuring that employees 
and customers provide just the appropriate amount of 
credentials and information, but no more, based on factors like 
the value of the transaction, information about the user and the 
device, and past behaviors 

The use of two\-factor and multi\-factor authentication (2FA and 
MFA) also surged 7 0% from the previous survey, reaching 56 8% 
They have become requirements for many classes of application, 
and vendors and security groups are coming up with ingenious 
ideas for the second and nth factors 

Several other IAM technologies are currently in use in half or 
more of all organizations These include single sign\-on (SSO), up 
3 8% to 53 6%; privileged account management (PAM), up 1 4% 
to 52 8%; and user and account provisioning and deprovisioning, 
which are up 1 7% to 52 3% 

The clear winner in the middle column of Table 5 is biometrics, 
with 40 5% of organizations planning to acquire or upgrade 
technology in that area Biometric technologies go even further 
than other MFA approaches in combining better security with 
increased convenience 

It is noteworthy that the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA) highlights identity as one of the five 
pillars of its Zero Trust Maturity Model CISA emphasizes that 
organizations should validate identities continuously, not just 
when initially granting access Additionally, organizations should 
fully implement just\-in\-time and just\-enough access controls and 
have global identity awareness across cloud and on\-premises 
environments We are likely to see more organizations move in 
these directions 

And whatever you may see in the movies, it is not possible 
to chop off someone’s finger and use it to open the door of 
a top\-secret laboratory That’s because of things like tissue 
deterioration and capacitive sensors in the fingerprint reader 
that must be activated by electrical charges in skin We thought 
you would want to know that

We have observed a trend toward greater use of managed 
security service providers (MSSPs), driven primarily by the 
shortage of skilled IT security staff If you can’t hire enough 
experienced security professionals, why not outsource routine, 
repetitive tasks? Or activities that require special skills that are in 
short supply? Or jobs that someone else has figured out how to 
automate? 

Hmm What are enterprises using MSSPs for? We asked that 
question in older editions of the Cyberthreat Defense Report, 
then dropped it for a few years We decided to ask again and 

compare the results with those from the 2019 report Figure 38 
shows responses of organizations that outsource at least one 
task to an MSSP, and Figure 39 shows how many organizations 
were not using an MSSP at all in those two years 

As we can see from Figure 39, only 10% of organizations didn’t 
work at all with an MSSP in 2019, and that figure was even lower 
in 2022: 6 8% In the big picture that isn’t much of a difference 

But Figure 38 shows that many of the security teams that were 
using MSSPs for one or two tasks in 2019 are now working with 
them on three or more

“What are enterprises using MSSPs for? We asked 

that question in older editions of the Cyberthreat 

Defense Report, then dropped it for a few years 

We decided to ask again and compare the results 

with those from the 2019 report ”

We can also see a significant shift in the mixture of the tasks 
being outsourced to MSSPs Actually, the ones that were the 
leaders in 2019 – managing vulnerability scans, mitigating DDoS 
attacks, detecting and responding to advanced threats, and 
monitoring and managing firewalls and UTM devices – are still 
common today, if at somewhat lower rates But the categories 
that were less popular in 2019 have shown tremendous increases 
over the past three years 

Specifically, 23 3% more organizations are using MSSPs to 
monitor and manage SIEM platforms The use of MSSPs to 
monitor and manage WAFs has increased 26 0% Monitoring 
and managing IDS/IPS systems is up 13 4%, and monitoring and 
managing SWG and SEG platforms has risen 17 0% 

Why the dramatic upswing in the use of MSSPs for all of these 
monitoring and managing tasks? It is partly attributable 
to the fact that these are very labor\-intensive activities, 
particularly when they involve filtering and prioritizing alerts 
Organizations would like to free up their security professionals 
for more\-strategic jobs Another major factor is that MSSPs have 
achieved a high level of automation of these tasks, so they can 
provide these services very economically to their clients 

However, our data included one surprise The conventional 
wisdom is that MSSPs are more popular with small organizations 
that can’t fill their staff with security specialists However, as 
shown in Figure 40, 87 4% of small organizations (500\-999 
employees) use an MSSP, and 92 7% of medium\-sized ones 
(1,000\-4,999 employees), but large and very large enterprises 
employ MSSPs even more often (94 3% or higher) Evidently, 
even very large security groups want to save money and free up 
their expert personnel for strategic projects 

Of course, some organizations outsource tasks related to specific 
applications or business units, while using their internal staff to 
perform the same tasks for other applications and business units 
Probably many of the large and very large enterprises are using 
MSSPs selectively rather than across the board But they do use 
them

Figure 42: Percentage of security applications and services delivered 
via the cloud, by country.

In August 2020, CyberEdge conducted a survey that was 
published as “The Impact of COVID\-19 on Enterprise IT Security 
Teams ” Of the 600 IT security professionals surveyed, three\-
quarters indicated a significant preference for cloud\-based 
security solutions over traditional on\-premises products 

That preference resulted in action Organizations made a heroic 
effort to support remote work, BYOD policies, and cloud\-based 
applications with cloud\-based security Between our 2020 
and 2021 reports, the percentage of security applications and 
services delivered via the cloud jumped from 35 7% to 40 6%, an 
increase of 4 9% (see Figure 41\) 

Between the 2021 and 2022 reports, the percentage moved up 
a more modest 0 5%, as security groups shifted from deploying 
new cloud\-based security solutions to tuning and consolidating 
the ones implemented earlier And the new record level, 41 1%, 
is pretty impressive, given that only a few years ago most people 
thought they couldn’t trust security products outside their 
organization’s data centers 

We believe the share of cloud\-based security offerings is likely 
to increase at a steady pace of around 0 5% to 1 0% per year for 
several years These offerings include security tools from public 
cloud platform providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, 
cloud\-based versions of existing on\-premises security products, 
and new security solutions developed from the ground up for 
cloud deployment 

The appetite for cloud\-based security applications and services 
varies considerably around the globe (see Figure 42\) Half of all 
security is cloud\-based in Brazil (50 3%) and the United States 
(50 1%) Not far behind come Mexico (46 7%) and Saudi Arabia 
(45 9%) At the other end of the spectrum, cloud\-based security 
solutions have not been so widely adopted in Japan (32 8%), 
France (32 3%), or Germany (31 3%) The nation with the lowest 
level of interest is China (30 9%)

Figure 44: Practices organizations use to enhance application security.

Many organizations are investing in application security You can 
prevent a lot of data breaches if you can build good security into 
an application and catch security\-related defects before it is put 
into production 

But what exactly are organizations doing to enhance application 
security? We added this question to the survey so you could find 
out what your peers are doing (see Figure 44\) 

The most popular practice is security training for application 
developers, provided by 63 0% of the organizations surveyed 
Traditionally, coders focused on functionality and did not 
have the knowledge or incentive to address security issues 
Security training encourages development teams to follow 
security best practices for architecting applications (e g , 
segmenting application components and controlling access 
between them), coding (e g , validating user input and using 
parameterized queries to block injection attacks), adding 
risk\-based authentication, encrypting data at rest and in motion, 
and other areas where security can be built into the application

“You can prevent a lot of data breaches If 

you can build good security into an application 

and catch security\-related defects before it 

is put into production ”

Developers can also be trained to test their own work to find 
security weaknesses in the code and in business logic 

Web application scanning is an automated way to uncover a 
wide range of vulnerabilities and defects in online applications It 
is performed at 53 4% of organizations 

Also widely used are third\-party security testing and bug 
bounty programs (52 2%) and penetration testing (42 4%) Both 
encourage human testers to think like attackers and replicate 
their techniques to find weaknesses that conventional scanning 
and software testing tools won’t detect Bounty programs are 
economical and can enlist a large number of freelance testers, 
but the participants get to choose what they test, so they may 
not cover all features of an application Penetration testing, either 
by internal staff or service providers, is more expensive, but the 
testers’ activities can be directed to ensure complete coverage 

Finally, development/security/operations (DevSecOps) 
practices, in use in 49 1% of organizations, ensure that software 
code is tested early and continuously during the application 
development process In the 2021 CDR we asked respondents 
about the benefits of DevSecOps practices They cited increased 
speed of deploying application updates and new applications, 
improved relations between development and security 
personnel, reduced costs, and fewer application security 
vulnerabilities

Figure 45: Technologies and architectures to enable secure work from home.

According to a recent blog post by the Gallup polling and 
analytics firm (Bet on It: 37% of Desks Will Be Empty), of the 60 
million Americans who could potentially work from home:

 30% would prefer to never come into the office during the 

week 

 60% want a blend of working one to four days per week at 

home 

 10% prefer working all five days in the office 

If everyone’s wish is granted, something like 54 million U S 
workers will need to be able to work securely from home at least 
one day a week, even after the COVID\-19 pandemic subsides If 
you add in similar figures for other countries around the world 
you get… a really, really big number 

We added a question to this year’s survey about what 
technologies and architectures enterprises are deploying to cope 
with this imperative (see Figure 45\)

The top two responses, each selected by about half the 
respondents, were those steady workhorses, anti\-virus and 
endpoint security software (51 9%) and virtual private network 
(VPN) technology (49 7%) Anti\-virus and various flavors of 
endpoint detection and response solutions are still considered 
key elements in a defense\-in\-depth strategy, and are likely to 
retain that status well into the future However, we think the use 
of VPNs may fall off in coming years as organizations adopt a 
variety of alternative network encryption methods that are easier 
to manage 

Software\-defined wide area networks (SD\-WANs) are used by 
43 5% of organizations to help protect home workers Besides 
ensuring that network traffic from remote locations travels 
over encrypted channels, many SD\-WAN products contribute 
to security with built\-in firewall, intrusion detection, and 
anti\-malware features 

Network access control (NAC) and mobile device and application 
management (MDM/MAM) solutions are deployed by 42 8% 
and 40 5% or the organizations in our survey, respectively These 
technologies prevent unauthorized connections to networks by 
enforcing access control policies, supporting advanced forms of 
authentication, and confirming that required security defenses 
are installed and active on computers and mobile devices 

Secure access service edge (SASE) architectures and ZTNA 
frameworks are seen as helping to protect remote employees in 
39 5% and 34 5% of organizations We will be discussing them 
more (along with SD\-WANs) on page 54

Figure 46: Plans for implementing emerging IT security technologies and architectures.

The final topic in this 2022 edition of the Cyberthreat Defense 
Report is a look at deployment plans for six emerging technologies 
and architectural approaches to security (see Figure 46\) 

The technology at the top of the list for “currently in production” 
plus “implementation in progress” is software\-defined wide 
area network (SD\-WAN) SD\-WAN products allow enterprises to 
replace dozens or hundreds of individually configured routers 

and expensive MPLS circuits with simple broadband connections 
to the internet Besides cutting networking costs, they 
dynamically route high\-priority traffic to faster links and provide 
higher levels of redundancy To strengthen security, they encrypt 
network traffic and sometimes enforce firewall and intrusion 
prevention rules With all these advantages, it is not surprising 
that SD\-WANs are in production or being implemented in four 
out of five organizations (81 9%)

“These emerging technologies and architectures 

can help your organization move toward more 

integrated, effective, and economical IT security 

If you are not familiar with any of them, we hope 

this report will prompt you to investigate ”

Second on this list is hardware\-based and firmware security, 
which is in production or implementation stages at 78 6% of 
organizations This category refers to security features that 
are embedded in chips or firmware, and therefore cannot 
be tampered with even if attackers take control of operating 
systems and hypervisors Hardware\-based and firmware security 
features can check at bootup to make sure operating systems 
and other software modules have not been corrupted or 
changed They can also securely store cryptographic keys and 
provide cryptographic services to applications 

Zero trust network access is also being implemented or used 
in more than three\-quarters (77 0%) of organizations ZTNA 
is a security framework that reduces network security risks by 
removing implicit trust of users on LANs and internal networks 
and enforcing strict user and device authentication for everyone 
Also, ZTNA solutions restrict users to only the applications and 
systems to which they have been explicitly granted access ZTNA 
is proving very popular Between the last survey and this one, the 
“currently in production” figure for ZTNA rose 6 3%, from 30 2% 
to 36 5% 

Passwordless authentication is currently in production or 
being implemented in 73 0% of organizations This solution 
involves technologies and standards that provide effective, 
convenient authentication without the use of passwords 
or other memorized credentials Authentication factors can 
include one\-time codes sent to smartphones, hardware tokens, 
fingerprints, facial features, voices, retinal patterns, behavioral 
patterns, gestures, and even pressure on keyboard keys 
Passwordless authentication techniques significantly reduce 
security risks (including the use of passwords for multiple 
accounts) and lower the costs of password reset and other 
support tasks We expect their use to grow 

Secure access service edge (SASE) is a cloud architecture that 
combines SD\-WAN and other key networking concepts with 
security functions such as firewall as a service (FaaS), secure web 
gateway (SWG), cloud access security broker (CASB), and features 
that support ZTNA In fact, there are so many elements in the 
SASE model that no one organization is ever likely to implement 
all of them But the model provides excellent guidance to 
enterprises and vendors that want a long\-term plan for 
implementing and integrating essential networking and security 
services, so it is now being adopted at 72 9% of organizations 

The final item on this list is extended detection and response 
(XDR), also in production or being implemented in 72 9% of 
organizations XDR platforms collect and correlate data from 
multiple security threat detection and incident response tools 
across an entire enterprise 

All these emerging technologies and architectures can help 
your organization move toward more integrated, effective, and 
economical IT security If you are not familiar with any of them, 
we hope this report will prompt you to investigate

Russia, Ukraine, Cyberwar, and Cyber 
Preparedness 

These paragraphs are being written during the first weeks of 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine So far, cyberwarfare, including 
attacks on Ukrainian government agencies and banking 
institutions and the dissemination of data\-wiping malware, 
have played a relatively minor role in the conflict While it is 
impossible at this point to know how the invasion will end or the 
part cyberattacks will play, we can make a few predictions about 
the effect it will have on security teams and the cybersecurity 
industry 

The invasion is ringing alarm bells across the world, not because 
we have learned anything new about the damage cyberwarfare 
can cause, but because we have been forced to reassess the 
likelihood that cyberwarfare will be used in future conflicts A 
few weeks ago, it seemed unthinkable that a nation like Russia 
would launch a brutal, unprovoked invasion of a neighbor, with 
cyberattacks as one component Today, how can we believe that 
future adversaries will hold back from unleashing one of the 
most powerful weapons in their arsenal, especially if they have 
fewer conventional arms than Russia?

Clearly, one likely effect is that national governments will 
become more aggressive in promoting, and often mandating, 
expanded cyber preparedness standards for both government 
agencies and commercial enterprises They will widen the 
definition of “critical infrastructure” to include not only power 
grids, financial networks, energy pipelines, and transportation 
equipment, but also networks and organizations that capture 
and communicate digital information, facilitate supply chains, 
provide healthcare, and perform other necessary functions Look 
also for governments to encourage, and often require, better 
and faster information sharing between organizations about 
cyberthreats 

There will be more pressure on security teams to prepare and 
test detailed incident response and business continuity plans 
so they can respond quickly to the types of attacks likely to 

be launched during cyberwarfare There will also be more 
scrutiny of unglamorous but essential processes like backup and 
recovery, vulnerability scanning, and identity management 

We also expect heightened interest in threat intelligence relative 
to state\-controlled hacker groups Many organizations that 
have been focusing on blocking cybercriminals with financial 
motivations will need to put more emphasis on bad actors 
working toward military and political goals There will be a 
premium on up\-to\-date information about the TTPs of groups 
who might conduct cyberwars 

Similarly, cybersecurity vendors will want to recalibrate their 
products and services toward thwarting the attacks expected in 
cyberwarfare Cybercriminals and cyberwarriors use many of the 
same tools, but their targets, techniques, and objectives differ It 
is still vital to protect personal data and credit card information, 
but there are going to be a lot of market opportunities in 
the near future for defending trains, planes, container ships, 
pipelines, factories, medical equipment, GPS systems, self\-driving 
vehicles, media outlets, and first responder and emergency 
response systems 

The Effects of COVID\-19 Continue to Play Out

In 2020 and 2021 security professionals scrambled to cope with 
the sudden disruptions caused by the COVID\-19 pandemic 
Their main focus was upgrading security for the huge surge of 
people working from home, often with unmanaged devices 
located far outside the corporate firewall and other perimeter 
defenses, and using new technologies to communicate and 
collaborate In many industries, COVID\-19 response also involved 
paying additional attention to the security of web and mobile 
applications as face\-to\-face interactions diminished and more 
and more activities and transactions were accomplished entirely 
by computer or smartphone In addition, security staff and other 
IT personnel had to learn how to work effectively from their own 
homes, with all the attendant distractions 

The scrambling isn’t so frantic anymore, but it has become clear 

2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report 

56

Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrent Security PosturePerceptions and ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices and StrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupThe Road Ahead

that many of the effects of COVID\-19 on the workplace are not 
going to be reversed As mentioned on page 52, in a recent 
Gallup survey, 90% of American workers want to continue to 
work at least one day a week at home (of which 30% prefer 
full\-time WFH) And consumers are going to keep shopping, 
studying, sightseeing, and schmoozing in pajamas (at least 
below the waist) 

We are expecting many of the technologies and programs 
initiated or accelerated because of the pandemic to stay on the 
front burner These include:

 Enhancing security and ease of use for remote workers by 

applying ZTNA concepts

 Increasing the security of BYOD programs and mobile apps

 Improving visibility and security of applications, data, and 

identities housed on cloud platforms

 Combining security and network management by 
implementing SD\-WANs and SASE architectures

 Building security into web and mobile apps through 

DevSecOps practices and security training for developers

 Increasing the security awareness of employees and other 
end users so they are less susceptible to phishing, social 
engineering, BEC, and ransomware attacks

Ransomware Might Be Topping Out

We are going to go out on a limb here The ransomware industry 
may have peaked, or at least be approaching its peak True, the 
number of organizations victimized continues to rise (see page 
21\) True, exfiltrating data gives ransomware gangs another 
club to hold over the heads of victims And true, the gangs 
have gotten better at finding new categories of victims (such as 
hospitals, schools, and local governments) and at judging what 
the market will bear regarding their ransom demands 

But the industry is starting to become a victim of its own 
successes, in that ransomware is now a top\-of\-mind issue for 
businesses, governments, and law enforcement agencies For 

example, national governments have been implementing plans 
to harden security for agencies, expand police powers and 
increase criminal penalties, create new cybersecurity standards 
for businesses, prevent funds (primarily ransoms in the form 
of cryptocurrencies) from reaching attackers, and mandate 
information sharing among private, public, and law enforcement 
organizations Examples include the US government’s Executive 
Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, the Australian 
government’s Ransomware Action Plan, and the international 
Counter Ransomware Initiative 

Equally important, law enforcement agencies have finally begun 
to take direct action against the bad actors Notably, Russia’s 
FSB conducted a round\-up of members of the REvil ransomware 
gang, and Europol has helped facilitate arrests in Ukraine, 
Romania, Kuwait, and other countries 

These are just the first steps, but they are significant Until 
recently, participants in the ransomware industry were 
essentially immune from punishment Now, they must take into 
account a serious possibility that they might be arrested and 
prosecuted Also, CEOs and boards of directors of enterprises of 
all sizes and in all industries are putting direct pressure on their IT 
security teams to do everything possible to thwart ransomware 
attacks In addition, security solution vendors are gearing up to 
deliver technologies that will help 

Looking at the big picture, we think there is good reason to 
believe that the growth curve of the ransomware industry will 
start to turn down in 2022, or at least 2023 

Third\-party Risks Will Be Top of Mind

We discussed on page 13 that third\-party risk management 
(TPRM) is one of the security capabilities that most of our 
survey respondents are least confident about We believe that 
their concern is well founded, and that over the next couple 
of years enterprises will be paying more attention than ever to 
vulnerabilities and risks created by third parties They include 
risks that:

2022 Cyberthreat Defense Report 

57

Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrent Security PosturePerceptions and ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices and StrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupThe Road Ahead

 Suppliers, contractors, and other third parties could be 

hacked or bribed into giving up credentials that attackers can 
use to access an organization’s applications and data 

 Equipment and software from third parties might contain 
vulnerabilities that can be used to penetrate networks 

 Third\-party scripts that run in browsers could be 

compromised and allow threat actors to capture credentials 
and data from customers and employees 

The second bullet is undoubtedly the most visible of those issues 
now, because of the vulnerabilities in the Apache Log4j software 
and recent memories of the backdoor in SolarWinds software 
For this and other reasons, we think that in the near future, 
organizations will expend significantly more effort monitoring 
and managing third\-party risks 

For the IT Skills Shortage, Necessity Can Be 
the Mother of Invention

As we noted on pages 15 and 24 and elsewhere in this report, a 
shortage of skilled IT security professionals is a serious problem 
for almost every organization and the biggest single impediment 
to improving the performance of security teams This shortage 
has been getting worse, and it is increasingly clear that supply 
may not catch up to demand in our lifetimes 

But as Plato said in The Republic: “our need will be the real 
creator” (later loosely translated as “necessity is the mother of 
invention”) When the need is pressing, people find answers We 
have discussed several in this report:

 Training new security professionals and upgrading the skills 

of existing ones

 Outsourcing selected security tasks to MSSPs

 Automating security tasks so experts can focus on 

more\-strategic work

But we predict that security groups will also try creative new 
ideas Redefine security jobs to make them more attractive? 
Make better use of part\-time employees and freelancers for 
specific tasks? Recruit and train candidates from overlooked 
groups? Run apprenticeship programs with local schools and 
colleges? Crowdsource good ideas? Recruit gamers with VR 
cybersecurity games and simulations? 

We don’t know what will succeed, but we think if some of the 
really smart people in cybersecurity put their minds to it, we can 
put a dent in this serious problem 

Communicating Security Issues to 
Management and Boards

As we mentioned on page 43, this year we added a response 
about cyber risk management and reporting to our question 
about security management and operations technologies – and 
found that it is already the second\-most popular item on our list 

There is no doubt that CEOs and boards of directors are giving 
unprecedented attention to IT security issues That means that 
IT management and security teams are under pressure to do a 
better job of explaining their work, aligning security programs 
with business objectives, and justifying investments in people 
and technology in terms of benefits to the business (not just 
by the number of vulnerabilities fixed or the indicators of 
compromise detected) 

We think IT organizations are going to demand more, better, and 
easier ways to collect security data and present it to executives 
and boards in the context of business issues, and where possible, 
quantify risk reduction And we expect security solutions vendors 
to respond by improving management reporting capabilities 
in existing security products and by delivering new solutions 
and services aimed specifically at compiling and presenting 
risk\-based data to help manage security programs

More Innovative Technologies

Here are other innovative concepts and technologies that we 
expect to hear more about in 2022 and beyond:

 API gateway and protection products help organizations 
protect applications designed with microservices and 
cloud\-native architectures (see page 40\) API gateways sit in 
front of application APIs and perform tasks such as enforcing 
authorization and encryption policies, scaling resources when 
traffic spikes, rate limiting to mitigate DDoS attacks and other 
forms of abuse, and sending usage data to billing systems 
API protection solutions provide security teams with tools to 
understand, detect, and respond to attacks targeting APIs 
Their capabilities can include mapping the attack surface 
to create an inventory of legitimate, rogue, and forgotten 
(“zombie”) APIs, blocking injection attacks and other exploits, 
analyzing attacker behaviors, and fingerprinting attackers so 
they can be tracked even when they change IP addresses API 
protection solutions can also help security teams correlate 
and analyze data across multiple data centers and cloud 
platforms In the future, more threat actors are going to be 
targeting APIs with more sophisticated attacks, which will 
make API gateways and API protection products increasingly 
essential for well\-rounded security programs 

 Hardware\- and firmware\-based security solutions 
prevent rootkits and other types of malware from 
corrupting operating systems and firmware and from 
capturing encryption keys They can play a part in thwarting 
ransomware attacks and detecting vulnerabilities and 
misconfigurations in unmanaged BYOD devices and in 
systems acquired from third parties 

 Tools for hybrid cloud and multi\-cloud environments 
will be a growth area On page 28 we discussed security 
challenges facing organizations that have spread computing 
workloads over multiple data centers and private and public 
clouds These challenges are going to become more pressing 
As security vendors respond, we will see more products that 
offer “single pane of glass” monitoring and unified policy 
enforcement across all (or at least most) of the popular data 
center and cloud platforms 

 Better security for operational technology (OT) and the 
Internet of Things (IoT) is desperately needed to protect 
utilities, critical infrastructure, and manufacturing plants, 
as well as emerging applications for smart devices, from 
cybercriminals, ransomware gangs, and hackers sponsored by 
hostile militaries As we discussed on page 12, governments 
have started to pay more attention to this, and even to fund 
research and development, and we expect to see progress 
over the next couple of years 

 Deepfake detection technology is still in its early phases, 
but will become very important as threat actors master 
sophisticated techniques for creating convincing deepfakes: 
images and recordings digitally altered to present a known 
person doing or saying something they did not do or say 
Deepfakes have already been involved in a small number 
of BEC attacks (e g , phone calls supposedly from the CEO 
ordering a subordinate to transfer money to a phony 
supplier) Unfortunately, there are numerous opportunities 
for deepfakes to enhance phishing and misinformation 
campaigns, attacks on brands, and many other malicious 
activities

CyberEdge developed a 27\-question, web\-based, vendor\-
agnostic survey instrument in partnership with our research 
sponsors The survey was promoted via email to 1,200 IT security 
professionals in 17 countries and 19 industries in November 
2021 The global survey margin of error for this research study (at 
a standard 95% confidence level) is \+/\- 3% All results pertaining 
to individual countries and industries should be viewed as 
anecdotal, as their sample sizes are much smaller CyberEdge 
recommends making actionable decisions based on global data 
only 

All respondents had to meet two filter criteria: (1\) they had to 
have an IT security role and (2\) they had to be employed by a 
commercial or government organization with a minimum of 500 
global employees 

At CyberEdge, survey data quality is paramount CyberEdge 
goes to extraordinary lengths to ensure its survey data is of the 
highest caliber by following these industry best practices:

 Ensuring that the “right” people are being surveyed by 

(politely) exiting respondents from the survey who don’t 
meet the respondent filter criteria of the survey (e g , job role, 
job seniority, company size, industry)

 Ensuring that disqualified respondents (who do not meet 

respondent filter criteria) cannot restart the survey (from the 
same IP address) in an attempt to obtain the survey incentive

 Constructing survey questions in a way that eliminates survey 

bias and minimizes the potential for survey fatigue 

 Only accepting completed surveys after the respondent has 

provided answers to all of the survey questions

 Ensuring that respondents view the survey in their native 

language (e g , English, German, French, Spanish, Japanese, 
Chinese)

 Randomizing survey responses, when possible, to prevent 

order bias

 Adding “Don’t know” (or comparable) responses, when 

possible, so respondents aren’t forced to guess at questions 
they don’t know the answer to

 Eliminating responses from “speeders” who complete the
