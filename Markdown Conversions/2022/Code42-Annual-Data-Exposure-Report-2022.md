Key Findings 

Today, data is a company’s most valuable asset, leading many to invest in Insider Risk 
Management programs. Some industries, such as the Public Sector and Financial Services, 
are at the more mature end of the spectrum, leading the way in addressing Insider Risk. 
Recent trends around employee turnover and remote work have created unprecedented 
challenges for security teams to protect valuable data from leaving the company. There 
needs to be more investments around educating the Board, training employees, and 
increasing visibility to data movement.

Part 1
Introduction 

As CISOs around the globe take stock of the cybersecurity landscape that has emerged 
as a result of the new hybrid\-remote world, Insider Risk has emerged as a top priority \- 
one that must be examined, understood and addressed from the top down. 

Growing awareness has been driven in part by burgeoning recognition from top analyst firms that Insider Risk 
Management (IRM) is a significant cybersecurity challenge that must be prioritized. Gartner recently evolved 
the User Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) category renaming it IRM, after first recognizing the new category in 
December 2020\. Forrester and IDC are also shining a spotlight on the importance of addressing Insider Risk. 

Insider Risk is any user\-driven data exposure event, either malicious, negligent or accidental in nature. 
Security leaders have recognized that managing Insider Risk is central to keeping their most important data 
\- source code, product designs, customer information \- from ending up in the wrong hands. The financial, 
reputational, privacy and compliance ramifications of sensitive data being exposed and leaked are significant. 
Even more significant is the risk of a company’s intellectual property (IP) ending up in the hands of a 
competitor. 

Unfortunately, there appears to be a four\-way disconnect – between cybersecurity leaders, cybersecurity 
practitioners, business leaders and the Board – when it comes to addressing data exposure and exfiltration 
as a result of Insider Risk. Research suggests this disconnect exists due to a lack of visibility into the size 
and scope of the data exposure and exfiltration problem, coupled with a lack of understanding across the 
company on its likelihood and impact. Ownership of the Insider Risk problem also remains vaguely defined.

There are many factors at play for the rise in Insider Risk concerns, but four rise to the top based on the 
findings in this report. First, more and more employees are leaving their jobs than ever before. Coined the 
Great Resignation or Big Quit, we saw a record number of employees \- 4\.5 million – leave their jobs in 
November 2021 alone. Second, there appears to be a culture of disconnect around the problem, which leads 
to uncertainty around ownership. Insider Risk is simply not being talked about enough from the top down or 
the bottom up. Third, companies need a better understanding of data movement. They don’t just need more 
visibility, they need better, more contextual visibility to determine what data movement poses unacceptable 
risk to the business. Lastly, employees are simply unaware of the risk they pose to the company. Despite 
massive investments in time, resources and technology and training, employee security awareness remains a 
challenge. 

Examining data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and previous DERs from 2020 and 2021, reveals that 
there is a one in three (37%) chance your company loses IP when an employee quits. Comparing this to data 
from Verizon DBIR 2020, departing employees are the second highest cause of a successful data breach, 
only behind hackers (45%) and ahead of social engineering (22%), user error (22%), malware (17%) and user 
misuse (8%). 

With a one in three chance that the company’s Intellectual Property data is walking out the door with a former 
employee, are you willing to take those odds?

Objective of the Annual Data Exposure Report 2022 

In past Annual Data Exposure Reports, Code42 has researched who, what, when, where, how and why 
employees expose and/or exfiltrate data. In the 2022 edition, we wanted to understand the impact of data 
exposure and exfiltration and why companies are challenged to prioritize IRM even though it has become clear 
over the years that Insider Risk is a persistent problem for cybersecurity teams to effectively manage. 

To explore this, we surveyed 700 respondents – senior business leaders, senior cybersecurity leaders and 
cybersecurity practitioners – from US companies with 500 or more employees from a range of public and 
private sectors.

Part 2
The Great Resignation 

Companies lack visibility into what types of data are leaving and how

With a record 4\.5 million people quitting their jobs in November 2021, the Great Resignation rages on and 
it’s no wonder nearly all (98%) respondents have cybersecurity concerns about their employees leaving the 
company. Nearly three\-fourths (71%) are concerned about lack of visibility over what and/or how much sensitive 
data departing employees take to other companies. The same proportion (71%) are concerned about sensitive 
data saved on local machines/personal hard drives and/or personal cloud storage and services. These 
concerns are not surprising, given real\-world examples of employees taking data with them to competitors, or 
even worse, leveraging it to hold their former employers for ransom. 

Looking specifically at the three groups surveyed, the differing concerns of business leaders, cybersecurity 
leaders and cybersecurity practitioners stand out. Business leaders are most concerned about lack of visibility 
into what types of data are leaving (49%) while cybersecurity practitioners are most likely to be concerned 
about data being saved on local machines or personal hard drives (52%). This highlights how business leaders 
are more concerned about the content of the data that is exposed, while practitioners are predictably more 
concerned about how data is being exposed. This is not surprising given the nature of each groups’ roles.

The discrepancy between the percentage of cybersecurity practitioners (77%) versus the percentage of 
cybersecurity leaders (63%) that are concerned about sensitive data saved on local machines, personal hard 
drives or personal cloud storage is also significant and likely indicates how much data exposure practitioners are 
witnessing via these vectors, while security leaders at some companies are potentially not engaged enough to 
grasp the full scope of the problem. 

The pandemic has brought about a huge surge in remote working which has certainly contributed to greater 
Insider Risk \- almost all respondents (97%) report having cybersecurity concerns as a result. However, it is far fewer 
(43%) who report that improving technologies for a remote/hybrid workforce is a top two priority for their company, 
suggesting a gap between concern and prioritization for the security of a remote workforce.

Part 3
Culture of 
Disconnect

Practitioners Left in The Dark while Cybersecurity Leaders 
Fight for a Voice in Business Decisions

Cybersecurity practitioners want a louder voice when it comes to setting the cybersecurity 
posture and priorities of their company, as they should – they’re the ones dealing 
minute\-by\-minute with the risks their company’s face. Today, practitioners report a lack of 
transparency – and consultation – from cybersecurity leaders around the decisions that 
are made. Unfortunately, cybersecurity leaders appear stuck between a rock and a hard 
place – spending more time consulting their teams for on\-the\-ground insight or addressing 
compliance mandates and Board demands. It leaves one very real question unanswered: 
how do you measure improvement and success? 

58%

Nearly three in five cybersecurity 
practitioners report that 
cybersecurity leaders don’t 
communicate the company vision 
to the rest of the cybersecurity team

57%

of practitioners report that they 
aren’t consulted about decisions 
that are made based on companies’ 
cybersecurity strategies

Policies continue to hamstring teams

Almost all (96%) companies experience challenges when it comes 
to protecting corporate data from Insider Risks. When looking at 
these challenges, it’s cybersecurity practitioners who are more 
directly affected. For example, half (50%) of these respondents 
report difficulties keeping policies up to date at the rate the 
business needs, compared to cybersecurity leaders (35%) and 
business leaders (38%). Policies that impede on employee 
productivity and collaboration is a challenge reported more 
heavily by practitioners (45%) versus cybersecurity leaders (38%) 
and business leaders (38%). With practitioners being more likely 
to use these policies, they are more likely to be suffering from 
using outdated tools and therefore understand the importance 
of a modern approach to security and collaboration, something 
that leaders are further removed from. This data highlights the 
disconnect between cybersecurity practitioners, security leaders, 
business leaders and Boards.

Cybersecurity 
professionals are on the 
front lines confronting 
Insider Risk on a daily 
basis and have a more 
complete understanding 
of its scope and impact, 
but are rarely consulted 
on how to address the 
problem. 

96% of companies experience challenges when it 
comes to protecting corporate data from Insider Risks

Bottom to top, there is a lack of transparency around the Insider Risk problem and it’s creating churn and 
frustration for the cybersecurity practitioners who see firsthand the size and scope of the Insider Risk problem, 
but cannot measure it. As our research shows, 98% of companies are concerned about Insider Risk indicating a 
vast majority have a data exposure problem. When it comes to measuring Insider Risk, companies should start 
with establishing a data exposure baseline. Cybersecurity practitioners should make sure they have certain 
metrics at their fingertips, including the percentage of all corporate data residing in untrusted locations by 
file category, the number of data exposure events by risk severity, the number of high severity data exposure 
events contained and the percentage improvement in data exposure events over time. If cybersecurity 
practitioners cannot measure Insider Risk, then cybersecurity leaders cannot quantify Insider Risk. If 
cybersecurity leaders cannot quantify the risk, then business leaders will never understand the impact, and if 
business impact is not understood, Boards will never prioritize the problem.

This vicious cycle has been going on for 
years only to be amplified by the 
Great Resignation, remote and hybrid 
work and a barrage of IP theft cases 
spotlighted in the news media. Managing 
Insider Risk starts with practitioners 
having the means to measure it and 
communicate up the chain. 

56% of cybersecurity 
leaders and practitioners

feel like they have a

decisions made by the

There is a disconnect from the perspectives of cybersecurity practitioners and leaders when reporting how 
frequently Insider Risk is a topic of discussion at Board meetings. The vast majority (81%) of cybersecurity 
leaders – 20% more than practitioners (61%) – report that Insider Risks are discussed at every meeting. Are 
cybersecurity practitioners receiving effective information from Boards regarding Insider Risk? This data 
suggests that Boards believe they are having the right conversations to address Insider Risk, but are perhaps 
still not grasping the full scope of the problem.

In order to improve the issues with transparent communication around the impact of Insider Risk, all parts 
of the business need to become better at collaborating. This starts by communicating the size and scope of 
Insider Risk and what it means to executive and Board\-level business objectives. However, almost all (91%) 
respondents believe that their companies’ Board requires more understanding of Insider Risk, so creating 
appropriate objectives and communicating them to the business likely is not happening, at least not effectively.

The findings show that Boards are strongly influencing cybersecurity leaders’ ability to make decisions, but 
who’s influencing the Board? A barrier to increasing Board level understanding of Insider Risk is who they 
listen to. The data governance and compliance team doesn’t place enough attention on Insider Risk (70%), yet 
cybersecurity respondents (45%) feel that the Board listens more to regulations than they do to them.

budgets will increase this

Only 21% of companies’ cybersecurity budgets are currently dedicated to mitigating Insider Risk, on average. In 
2021\* , 54% of cybersecurity leaders spent less than 20% of their budgets on Insider Risk. However, acceptance 
of the need to increase the budget is increasing, with 73% of respondents stating that their companies’ budget 
for protecting against Insider Risk is insufficient, up from 66% of cybersecurity leaders who cited this in last 
year’s report\* . There is positive momentum, however – companies are recognizing that Insider Risk is a pressing 
concern and the impacts need to be avoided. Nearly two\-thirds (65%) believe they will be successful in securing 
a larger budget for Insider Risk Management in the coming year.

The need for an Insider Risk Management (IRM) program is clear, with 61% of companies currently using one and 
36% planning to implement one in the future. Respondents from financial services (76%) and the public sector 
(84%) are leading the way and most likely to report that their company has an IRM program, while those in media, 
leisure and entertainment (44%) and business and professional services (47%) are lagging behind and the least 
likely to.

Concerningly, 98% of respondents have fears regarding Insider Risk events 
in their company, with reputational damage, loss of IP/customer data and 
revenue loss being the three most likely fears.

These fears are at risk of becoming reality as eight in ten (80%) report 
that reputation has/would be impacted because of an Insider Risk event 
involving loss or theft of sensitive information, with this being more likely 
for those without an IRM program (84%). These impacts should serve as 
significant motivators for those without an IRM program to implement one.

However, while 61% of companies say they have an Insider Risk 
Management program, 73% of respondents report Insider Risk is still a big 
problem within their company. Surprisingly though, the majority (63%) of 
surveyed companies do not measure the success of Insider Risk detection. 
This disconnect begs the question \- have companies with an IRM program 
implemented one that is truly effective? Companies that have a program 
are likely to be more risk\-aware because they invested in one in the first 
place, but these results suggest challenges persist. It could be that, for 
those companies, taking the first steps in implementing an IRM program 
has highlighted just how much data exposure exists within their company, 
crystalizing how much more work needs to be done. This is likely an 
important turning point for companies, to realize that an effective Insider 
Risk Management program balances and measures each element of 
people, process and technology.

Nearly two years into the pandemic, companies are still adapting to new ways 
of working, with some choosing to go permanently fully remote and others 
returning to the office in starts and stops. For the majority, managing a hybrid 
workforce will be a near\-term reality. This presents a number of cybersecurity 
challenges, with over half (55%) of surveyed respondents sharing concerns about 
employees becoming lax in their cybersecurity practices/protocols, a feeling that 
is particularly strong for those in the public sector (70%).

This data demonstrates the critical need for security education and awareness 
training, particularly during this new era of hybrid work. Companies can mitigate 
risk by changing user behavior through training, creating a more risk\-aware 
workforce. Frequency and quality of training are two of the most important 
variables. It is most common for companies to conduct security training on a 
monthly basis. For around a third (32%) of companies this is the case, followed by 
weekly (22%), quarterly (20%), daily (11%) and annually (9%). 

Surprisingly, after parsing the data in search of correlations, the data shows that 
companies conducting training more frequently (daily or weekly) are actually 
more likely to find it difficult to detect Insider Risk and see Insider Risk as a big 
problem for their company, compared to those conducting it monthly or quarterly 
(see figure 4\). This leads to a question as to whether companies that report 
providing training more frequently are offering training that is truly effective. It 
can be deduced from this data that companies providing training on a monthly 
or quarterly basis are providing more quality, relevant training that leads to fewer 
challenges with Insider Risk within their company.

With these results in mind, there are two areas that companies should focus on when conducting training – 
the frequency and the quality. Training employees should be both proactive and responsive. Proactively, in 
order to change employee behavior, companies should provide both long\- and short\-form training modules 
to instruct and remind users of best behaviors. Additionally, companies should respond with a micro\-
learning approach using bite\-sized videos designed to address highly specific situations. The security team 
needs to take a page from marketing, focusing on repetitive messages delivered to the right people at the 
right time. 

Part 6
Industry breakout

When reviewing responses by industry, public sector and financial services companies are leading the way in 
Insider Risk Management and protecting valuable data, based on the percentage of their global cybersecurity 
budget dedicated to mitigating the problem. Both industries are using around a quarter (26% and 24%) of their 
global cybersecurity budget to combat Insider Risk.

It’s both the public sector (84%) and financial services industry (76%) that have the highest percentage of 
companies with an IRM program in place, which is perhaps not surprising given the potential historical impacts of 
an insider breach in these two sectors. Media, leisure and entertainment companies have the smallest average 
budget allocated to mitigating Insider Risk (16%), which could explain why they are the least likely to have an IRM 
program (44%). This lackluster approach is concerning, particularly when considering the challenges the media 
industry is facing at the moment. Policies impeding on employee productivity (47%), difficulties keeping policies 
up to date at the rate of business needs (45%) and solutions failing to detect relevant data and files, i.e., false 
negatives (44%) are just a few of the issues faced in relation to Insider Risk for media.

Furthermore, as a result of the COVID\-19 pandemic, it’s companies within the public sector that are most likely to 
be or are planning to add new cybersecurity technologies for better monitoring of file movements, with almost six 
in ten (58%) reporting so. Of course, with this comes a greater need to set aside budget to mitigate Insider Risk. 
For financial services, greater emphasis is put on more adoption, training and enforcement around collaboration 
tools as reported by more than half (57%).

With 98% of surveyed companies in the financial industry reporting having fears regarding Insider Risk, it’s critical 
that such events are mitigated. But it is not just financial services that have these fears – they’re present across 
all industries. Those in healthcare (public or private) are the most likely to fear reputational damage (72%), which 
makes sense given the sensitive nature of the data they collect and store. Loss of IP/customer data is feared most 
for those in retail distribution and transport (59%), as is revenue loss (54%). It is those in the energy, oil/gas and 
utilities sector that are the most likely to fear their ability to hire and retain employees (57%) as a result of Insider 
Risk events. While fears are present across all industries, the specific fears that are felt differ by how Insider Risk 
events impact industries.

Companies, regardless of their maturity, are likely to list improving cybersecurity against external 
threats as among one of their top two information security priorities. Companies of various maturity 
levels diverge, however, when it comes to Insider Risk. Companies with an IPO planned for the next 
12\-18 months are prioritizing managing Insider Risk in a number of ways. Pre\-IPO companies are much 
more likely (51%) to make Insider Risk Management a top priority, compared to those who had a major 
merger, acquisition or divestiture occur in the last 12 months (32%) or who have one planned in the 
next 12 months (26%).

It is not surprising that pre\-IPO companies are making Insider Risk Management a priority, given that IP 
is a valuable asset during IPO transactions. Pre\-IPO companies are also likely driven by the compliance 
requirements around security controls that they must adhere to after filing to go public. Pre\-IPO 
companies are most likely to have an IRM program (77%). Even more, Insider Risk is a Board\-level priority 
for 85% of pre\-IPO companies, with 82% indicating Insider Risk is discussed at every Board meeting.

“We had 90 to 120 days before going public 
to have a solution and a really tight story 
about our insider threat program,” 

says Mario Duarte, Snowflake’s VP of Security.

Regardless of maturity, reputational damage as a result of Insider Risk events is the 
number one concern across all companies. But there are some differences in the 
proportion who have other fears. One surprising finding is that loss of IP/customer 
data is more likely to be a fear for companies that had a major merger, acquisition or 
divestiture in the last 12 months (51%) than it is for those that have one planned in the 
next 12 months (35%), perhaps due to employees departing post\-merger. This could 
signal a level of naivety around IP pre\-merger and that going through a major transition 
\- and potentially making some mistakes along the way \- makes companies realize just 
how important it is to effectively protect IP.

 
Part 8
Conclusion

Companies need to start challenging their approach to Insider Risk, with the 
results of this research suggesting three main areas to focus on:

Trust and transparency 
We’re seeing a disconnect at every level of the business, particularly among business 
leaders and the cybersecurity team. Leaders need to work with the cybersecurity team 
to tackle Insider Risks and produce a well\-thought\-out policy on data handling that can 
be delivered to their employees. Cybersecurity practitioners need to be transparent with 
cybersecurity leaders on the size and scope of the problem. Cybersecurity leaders need to 
trust practitioners have a good grasp on the extent of the data exposure and Insider Risk 
problem. The missing component around trust and transparency is metrics; for example, the 
percentage of all corporate data residing in untrusted locations by file category, the number 
of data exposure events by risk severity, the number of high severity data exposure events 
contained and the percentage improvement in data exposure events over time. Without the 
right Insider Risk metrics, transparency and trust is not possible be it decisions made bottom 
to top, or top to bottom. 

Training 
Alongside reducing the disconnect across the company, employees need to be educated on 
the business impact of their actions, and this needs to be done through collaborative training 
that is in line with corporate policy and culture. At present, very few companies are satisfied 
with the training that is provided to their employees on Insider Risk so business leaders, 
cybersecurity leaders and practitioners could all benefit from investing in an employee 
training program dedicated to reducing Insider Risk. 

Insider Risk Management (IRM) program 
Many companies are seeing the benefits of an IRM program or recognize the need to have 
one. While being consistently transparent and delivering robust training programs are key 
to the success of mitigating Insider Risk, there is always going to be exposure to company 
data and thus business impact and risk from the actions of insiders. Companies need to 
take a good look at their IRM program or lack thereof. Starting with people and process 
requirements rooted in understanding the likelihood and business impact of Insider Risk 
events. Technology plays a major role in enabling business leaders, cybersecurity leaders 
and Boards to understand their Insider Risk exposure and impact. Focusing on exposure 
and potential impact enables security teams to establish the right metrics to measure Insider 
Risk posture and maturity overtime, report that to the business leaders and the Board, and 
everybody wins.

Methodology

Code42 commissioned independent market research agency Vanson Bourne to conduct the 
Data Exposure Research. The 2022 study surveyed 700 respondents (150 senior business 
leaders, 200 senior cybersecurity leaders, 350 cybersecurity practitioners) from companies 
in the US in September and October 2021\. These companies had 500 or more employees 
and were from a range of public and private sectors, including business and professional 
services, financial services, IT and telecoms, and media, leisure and entertainment, among 
other sectors.

All interviews were conducted using a rigorous multi\-level screening process to ensure that 
only suitable candidates were given the opportunity to participate.

Vanson Bourne conducted the 2022 DER. Any figures from previous DERs have been lifted 
directly from the reports that Vanson Bourne did not conduct.

Code42 has in the past worked with various research firms and previously published Annual 
Data Exposure Reports in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 volume I and 2021 volume II.
