EXECUTIVE 
SUMMARY

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) leads 

the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to our 

cyber and physical infrastructure. We connect our stakeholders 

in industry and government to each 

other and to resources, analyses, and 

CISA is excited to share the progress achieved by its Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) 

tools to help them build their own cyber, 

Platform that was developed to support vulnerability awareness and remediation across 

communications, and physical security 

the federal enterprise. The VDP Platform launched in July 2021, and it has since supported 

and resilience, in turn helping to ensure

the American people.

capability to identify, deter, and respond to the increasingly sophisticated cyber campaigns 

and malicious actors that threaten the security of public and private systems and data. 

In collaboration with other CISA services and teams, the VDP Platform aligns to these 

national cybersecurity priorities by providing a modern, user\-friendly interface that 

strengthens the federal vulnerability management process; increases insight into 

individual agency vulnerability disclosures; reduces the administrative, triage and reporting 

burdens agencies face; and, due to CISA’s central visibility throughout the VDP Platform, 

enhances the sharing of cyber threat intelligence information and best practices.

As the first cybersecurity service launched by CISA’s Cybersecurity Shared Services Office 

(CSSO), the VDP Platform has onboarded 40 agency programs and has received over 

1,300 valid disclosures, approximately 85% of which have been remediated. Working 

across CISA and through collaboration and partnership, the VDP Platform improves 

vulnerability management and compliance reporting for the federal enterprise. The VDP 

Platform provides agencies with an ease of access to a worldwide community of public 

security researchers whose skills and perspectives the agencies may leverage.

VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICY BACKGROUND

WHY ARE VDPs IMPORTANT?

Establishing a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) enables a process through which Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) 

agencies can be notified of vulnerabilities that may otherwise remain undisclosed. A VDP facilitates good\-faith security research, 

commits the agency to respond to vulnerability notifications, and creates an environment where researchers are more 

comfortable disclosing vulnerabilities. Without a defined policy, researchers may be more reluctant to disclose vulnerabilities, 

whether for legal, logistical or accessibility reasons. Likewise, if a policy is not defined, there are no governing mechanisms to 

ensure disclosures are coordinated, leading to possible scenarios where vulnerabilities are made public prior to the impacted 

agency being made aware of or able to remediate them� 

BINDING OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVE 20\-01

In September 2020, the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) 

issued Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 20\-01, which requires each FCEB agency to develop and publish a VDP. Under BOD 

20\-01, agencies are required to expand the scope of their policies to include all internet\-accessible systems or services and 

establish and maintain procedures for handling disclosed vulnerabilities, including how reports will be tracked to resolution and 

remediation activities will be coordinated� 

During the development of BOD 20\-01, CISA identified that many FCEB agencies lacked both a formal mechanism to receive 

vulnerability information from third parties and a defined strategy for handling such reports. To help agencies meet BOD 20\-01’s 

requirements, CISA established the VDP Platform to intake, triage and communicate vulnerabilities disclosed by researchers. 

The VDP Platform also automatically facilitates the compliance reporting metrics to CISA on behalf of user agencies, reducing the 

reporting burden agencies face� 

THE VDP PLATFORM 
OVERVIEW 

Launched in July 2021 in partnership with private sector vendors EnDyna and Bugcrowd, the VDP Platform gives public 

security researchers a centralized dashboard to search for and disclose any vulnerabilities found on in\-scope systems across 

the FCEB. The VDP Platform aims to promote good\-faith security research, ultimately resulting in improved security and 

coordinated disclosure across the FCEB. The VDP Platform gives FCEB agencies a single, user\-friendly interface for intaking 

vulnerability information from and collaborating with the researcher community to strengthen their cybersecurity�

STRATEGIC FUNCTIONS

At its core, the VDP Platform strengthens the FCEB’s ability to define, understand and mitigate vulnerabilities. 

The VDP Platform triages each disclosure upon receipt from a researcher, conducting an initial validation of 

the disclosure’s legitimacy and classification while also assigning it a priority rating score based on its severity. 

By conducting this initial intake and validation process on behalf of participating agencies, the VDP Platform 

saves each agency significant time and resources and allows each to prioritize only valid submissions.

The VDP Platform leverages the diverse skill sets of the public security researcher community, bridging the 

gap between the public and private sectors to better enhance the federal government’s cyber posture. The 

VDP Platform has a modern, user\-friendly interface that allows public researchers to search for vulnerabilities 

across several agencies’ VDP pages efficiently while staying in close contact on the status of their disclosure. 

Enabling collaboration between government and the public researcher community is essential to CISA’s 

mission of understanding, managing and reducing risk to the nation’s cyber infrastructure.

VDP PLATFORM INSIGHTS

Since launch, the VDP Platform has seen tremendous growth in the number of participating agencies and vulnerabilities 

disclosed. As more agencies participate on the VDP Platform, CISA’s insight into vulnerabilities across the FCEB becomes 

more comprehensive, leading to more\-effective network protection and prioritization of remediation and resources. 

These vulnerabilities exist on FCEB systems regardless of whether they are discovered, and the more vulnerabilities disclosed 

through the VDP Platform and remediated by agencies is a net positive. The VDP Platform increases agencies’ awareness of 

the vulnerabilities within their own systems and allows for both greater coordination around remediation and dissemination of 

threat intelligence around disclosed vulnerabilities. For example, all incoming submissions are monitored for Known Exploited 

Vulnerabilities (KEVs), which has led to the detection of KEVs on federal systems that were not identified by existing scanning tools.

VDP PLATFORM’S BUG BOUNTY CAPABILITY

WHAT IS A BUG BOUNTY? 

Bug bounties are events designed to provide financial incentives to invite the public to further research specific systems for 

vulnerabilities� A bug bounty event offers agencies a cost\-effective way to identify vulnerabilities and attract elite researchers 

from across the world that agencies may not otherwise normally or practically engage� Bug bounties are an optional feature 

of the VDP Platform and are not required by BOD 20\-01\. Agencies determine the payment amount and fund the rewards 

(i.e., the bounty), and the VDP Platform facilitates the agency\-funded payment to the researcher on the backend.

HOW THE VDP PLATFORM SUPPORTS BUG BOUNTIES

The bug bounty functionality enables agencies to take full advantage of the VDP Platform’s vulnerability management 

offerings and augments agency\-specific vulnerability disclosure processes. Likewise, given the financial awards 

offered as incentive, bug bounties tend to draw elite researchers to enhance the volume and quality of vulnerability 

reporting. Agencies maximize the value of their bug bounties with help from the VDP Platform, which:
