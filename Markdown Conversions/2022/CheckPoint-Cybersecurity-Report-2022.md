## Chapter 1: Introduction to the Check Point 2022 Security Report

THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS REPRESENTS ONE OF THE MOST TURBULENT AND DISRUPTIVE PERIODS ON RECORD, AT LEAST AS FAR AS SECURITY IS CONCERNED.

<br>

MAYA HOROWITZ
VP Research, Check Point

The past twelve months represents one of the most turbulent and disruptive periods on record, at least as far as security is concerned. As governments and businesses around the world continued to navigate the uncharted waters of a global pandemic, the so-called “new normal” still felt a long way off. Digital transformation efforts were dramatically accelerated as businesses embraced hybrid and remote working arrangements, but the same questions around security maturity that plagued many businesses in 2020 persisted through 2021. While some of those questions remain up in the air, threat actors have wasted no time whatsoever in turning the situation to their advantage. Cyberattacks are up by an average of 50% since we issued our last annual report, with the education and research sector suffering the biggest blow, averaging 1,605 attacks every single week throughout the year. As predicted, the infamous SolarWinds breach appears to have kickstarted a trend of supply chain attacks that have persisted throughout the year, showing no signs of slowing down. In this 2022 Security Report, we will reveal the key attack vectors and techniques that our researchers here at Check Point Software have observed over the past year. From a new generation of highly sophisticated supply chain attack methods, right through to the Log4j vulnerability exploit that rendered hundreds of thousands of businesses open to a potential breach. 

We’ll start with a month-by-month rundown of the year’s major cyber events, before doing a deep dive into some of the emerging trends that will undoubtedly shape the year to come. We’ll discuss cloud services, developments in the mobile landscape and IoT, cracks in the ransomware ecosystem, the return of Emotet, and, of course, the Log4J zero-day vulnerability that punctuated an already busy year.


## Chapter 2: Timeline of 2021's Major Cyber Events

IN 2021, WE WITNESSED AN UNUSUALLY HIGH NUMBER OF ATTACKS THAT LED TO DISRUPTIONS TO INDIVIDUALS’ DAY-TO-DAY LIVES, AND IN SOME CASES EVEN THREATENED THEIR SENSE OF PHYSICAL SECURITY. 

<br>

In January, the US Department of Justice confirmed that it had been affected by the Solarwinds supply-chain attack, and that 3% of its employee email boxes had been accessed in order to steal sensitive data. The department has more than 100,000 employees across a series of law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the US Marshals Service. The Department of Justice was a buyer of SolarWinds Orion, a tool that was used by hackers to execute this attack, leading to as many as 18,000 SolarWinds customers experiencing a breach. The Department of Justice said it learned it was a victim on Christmas Eve, revealing that a small percentage of its Microsoft Office 365 email accounts had been compromised. 

In February, popular music streaming platform, Spotify, was hit by a credential-stuffing attack, only three months after experiencing a similar incident. The attack used stolen credentials from 100,000 user accounts and leveraged a malicious Spotify login database. The attack was reported to Spotify, which prompted the company to issue a password reset to affected users that rendered the stolen credentials invalid. The company said in a statement that it also worked to have the fraudulent database taken down by its internet service provider, and noted that the attack was not linked to a breach in Spotify's own security. Cybercriminals carrying out credential-stuffing exploit people who reuse the same passwords across multiple online accounts and platforms. Attackers simply build automated scripts that systematically try stolen IDs and passwords against various types of accounts.

On March 2nd, 2021, Volexity reported the in-the-wild exploitation of the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities, CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065. Further investigation uncovered that an attacker was exploiting a zero-day used in the wild. The attacker was using the vulnerability to steal the full contents of several user mailboxes. This vulnerability is remotely exploitable and does not require authentication, special knowledge or access to a specific environment. It was estimated that 250,000 servers fell victim to the attacks, including servers belonging to around 30,000 organizations in the United States and 7,000 servers in the United Kingdom. The European Banking Authority, the Norwegian Parliament, and Chile's Commission for the Financial Market (CMF) were also impacted.

In April, the US National Security Agency (NSA), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) published a joint advisory warning that a Russia-linked APT group, APT29, was exploiting five vulnerabilities in an ongoing attack against US targets. According to the advisory, Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) actors (also known as APT29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes) frequently used publicly known vulnerabilities to conduct widespread scanning and exploitation against vulnerable systems in an effort to obtain authentication credentials to allow further access. Recent Russian SVR activities include compromising SolarWinds Orion software updates, targeting COVID-19 research facilities through deploying WellMess malware, and leveraging a VMware vulnerability that was a zero-day at the time.

In May, a ransomware attack shut down the routine operations of Colonial Pipeline, which carries 45% of the fuel consumed in the US East Coast, including diesel, petrol and jet fuel. The alleged Russian DarkSide ransomware criminal group, was behind the attack. Colonial Pipeline is the largest refined products pipeline in the US, a 5,500 mile (8,851 km) system involved in transporting over 100 million gallons from the Texas city of Houston to New York Harbor. DarkSide uses Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, where it relies on affiliate program to execute its cyber attacks. Colonial Pipeline paid a ransom demand of close to US$ 5 million in return for a decryption key. Later on, the FBI declared it had retrieved the private key of the ransom account and recovered 63.7 of the bitcoins paid.

JBS, the US-based meat processing giant, was hit by a ransomware attack in June affecting its North American and Australian operations. The FBI attributed the attack to the REvil ransomware group. The attack forced JBS to temporarily shut down all of its beef plants in the United States. One of its Canadian plants was also affected, and the company paused beef and lamb kills in Australia until the plants were back online. On June 9, JBL’s Chief Executive in the US revealed the company had paid US$ 11 million to hackers in a “very painful but necessary decision”, despite the fact that the company was able to restore most of its systems from its own backups. 

In July, the REvil ransomware group targeted multiple Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and their customers in a supply chain attack. Threat actors successfully implanted a malicious software update for IT Company Kaseya’s VSA patch management and client monitoring tool, which included the malware installer. An estimated 1,000 companies were impacted by the attack. The massive supply chain attack carried out by REvil over the 4th of July weekend impacted numerous Kaseya customers with millions of USD demanded in ransom. Kaseya issued a security advisory on their site, warning all customers to immediately shut down their VSA server to prevent the spread of the attack while they investigated. In order to breach on-premise Kaseya VSA servers, REvil used a zero-day vulnerability that was in the process of being fixed. The vulnerability had been previously disclosed to Kaseya by security researchers from the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD), and Kaseya was validating the patch before rolling it out to customers. However, the REvil ransomware gang was one step ahead of Kaseya and used the vulnerability to carry out their attack, with ransoms ranging from US$ 45K to US$ 5 million. With the attack on Kaseya VSA servers, REvil’s affiliate was initially targeting Kaseya’s MSSP’s, with a clear intent to propagate to the MSSP customers. The attack amplified exponentially from the MSSP to the actual customers.

The largest ever distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack was detected in August, with 17.2 million requests-per-second. The attack was facilitated by the Mirai botnet, targeting an organization in the financial industry. In this specific incident, the traffic originated from more than 20,000 bots in 125 countries worldwide, with almost 15% of the attack originating from Indonesia, followed by India, Brazil, Vietnam, and Ukraine. Mirai was first observed in 2016 targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as CCTV cameras and routers. Numerous variants of the botnet have emerged since, expanding the list of targeted devices to include Linux routers and servers, Android devices, and more.

Check Point Research saw a global surge in the black market for fake COVID-19 vaccine certificates on Telegram, following US President Biden’s vaccine mandate announcements. The black market expanded to serve 28 countries, including Austria, UAE, Brazil, UK, Singapore and more. The price for fake vaccine certificates also jumped globally, including in the US, where it doubled from US$ 100 to US$ 200. 

In October, the infrastructure of the Russia-based REvil ransomware gang, responsible for numerous ransomware attacks, was compromised and forcibly taken-down for the second time in three months, bringing their operation to a halt. This comes after REvil’s leaks website “Happy Blog” was previously shut down in July (along with the suspicious disappearance of one of REvil gang leaders “UNKN”), and after it was brought back up again during September, by one of its remaining gang leaders. REvil ransomware became notorious during 2021 with a series devastating attacks, especially after their successful ransom of the JBS food company, for US$ 11 million, and their later compromise of Kaseya - a US software management company, in July. These increasingly devastating attacks were matched by an increased pressure from authorities, and the launch of an offensive attack against REvil’s infrastructure and its members.

On November 14, Emotet, one of the most infamous botnets in history, rose from the dead after it was taken down ten months earlier, by a joint international law enforcement operation. Emotet used the Trickbot botnet to jump-start its operation, when machines already infected with the Trickbot Trojan, started to download and execute the latest version of Emotet. Emotet itself came back even stronger than before, with some new additions to its toolbox, such as an updated encryption scheme, control-flow obfuscations and new delivery methods.

On December 9th, an acute remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability was reported in the Apache logging package Log4j 2 versions 2.14.1 and below (CVE-2021-44228). Apache Log4j is the most popular java logging library with over 400,000 downloads from its GitHub project. It is used by a vast number of companies worldwide, enabling logging in a wide set of popular applications. Exploiting this vulnerability is simple. The Log4j library is embedded in almost every internet service or application we are familiar with, including Twitter, Amazon, Microsoft, Minecraft and more. Since the outbreak, Check Point Research witnessed what looks like an evolutionary repression, with new variations of the original exploit being introduced rapidly - over 60 in less than 24 hours. This was clearly one of the most serious vulnerabilities on the internet in recent years.


## Chapter 3: 2021’s Cyber Security Trends

THROUGHOUT 2021, SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS GREW IN BOTH FREQUENCY AND SCALE. RESEARCHERS CONCLUDED THAT SOFTWARE SUPPLY-CHAIN ATTACKS INCREASED BY NO LESS THAN 650% THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

### From SolarWinds to Log4j

The infamous SolarWinds supply chain attack was revealed in December 2020, but its influence on the cloud attack landscape, with particular regard to supply chain attacks, has led to its inclusion in our report once again. The SolarWinds incident originated with a sophisticated malware, Sunburst, incorporated into several compromised versions of an IT resource management product named SolarWinds Orion, used by 33,000 customers worldwide. The malicious update, attributed to the Russian Intelligence agency-affiliated threat group called ‘Nobelium’, found its way to around 18,000 corporations, successfully infecting approximately 425 companies on the Fortune 500 list, as well as US government departments including the Department of Homeland Security and the Treasury Department.

> The SolarWinds attack was very much a milestone moment for the security community, not just because of the scale of the attack, but because the technique that was used revealed new levels of sophistication that increased the threat of supply chain attacks more generally. The SolarWinds breach set a new tone and, as predicted, we’ve seen the number of software supply-chain incidents grow in its wake. This past year, we’ve seen the number of incidents increase six-fold, and there are yet again signs that businesses aren’t prepared to deal with the threat.” 

<br>

Naturally, prominent APT groups are an integral part of the trend. The North Korean Lazarus group recently began targeting IT service providers to launch supply chain attacks, and a new backdoor called BLINDINGCAN has already been used to target a Latvian IT vendor and a South Korean software company. Additional incidents include an attack against a CCTV vendor carried out by an affiliate of the DarkSide ransomware gang, in which the actors compromised the vendor’s website to infect its clients with ransomware.

One of the most significant supply chain attacks of 2021, also featuring ransomware delivery, targeted Kaseya, a global provider of IT management software for managed service providers (MSPs) and IT teams. The attack was carried out by a member of the affiliates program of the REvil ransomware group. According to the Kaseya CEO, less than 0.1% of the company’s customers were accessed, but as some of Kaseya’s clients are MSPs themselves, as many as 1,500 companies were affected by the attack. The threat actors cleverly exploited a vulnerability affecting Kaseya’s internet-facing VSA servers. VSA is a remote-monitoring tool commonly used by MSPs for the management of network and endpoint devices. When the attack was discovered by Kaseya, the company urged its customers to shut down their VSA servers.

As detailed in our previous report, beyond its unprecedented scale, SolarWinds’ main innovation lies in its technique. In order to gain access to an organization’s sensitive Microsoft 365 resources, the attackers first used a forged token to compromise the local and on-premise networks, before moving laterally to the cloud environment. Today, we can clearly state that the SolarWinds attack laid the foundations for a rapid surge in supply chain attacks. 
Throughout 2021, software supply chain attacks grew in both frequency and scale. Researchers concluded that software supply-chain attacks increased by no less than 650% throughout the year. A study issued by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) reviewed two dozen incidents and found that 66% of supply chain attacks were committed by exploiting an unknown vulnerability, while only 16% leveraged known software flaws. Most attacks actually targeted software code. This year, it seems that organizations were once again caught largely unprepared, as a survey concluded that 82% of companies designate the third party vendors that make up their software supply chain with highly privileged roles. 76% provide roles that could allow account takeover, and, worst of all, over 90% of designated security teams were not aware that such permissions were even granted. 

This year, the group behind the SolarWinds attack itself resumed activity, utilizing the approach developed for the first attack and focusing yet again on companies that are part of the global IT supply chain. However, this time, a different part of the chain is being targeted, namely cloud resellers and tech service providers. These companies customize, implement, and manage cloud services for their customers. The threat group clearly relies on these companies’ direct access to their clients’ environments to obtain access to their full client lists in a single strike, impersonating a trusted partner. The operation has been taking place since May 2021 and has already impacted more than 140 resellers and providers, compromising 14 of them. Throughout the second half of the year, the ‘Nobelium’ threat group has been highly active, but with a lower success rate due to growing awareness. The group utilizes multiple tactics, including the use of stolen credentials obtained via an info-stealer campaign by a third-party actor, leveraging application impersonation privileges to collect protected mail data, and abuse multi-factor authentication (MFA). The recent attack wave may signal a growth in the resources invested by the Russian state-sponsored group in the field of supply chain operations, as a means to establish persistent access to targets of interest to the Russian government.

In late October, the popular NPM package ‘ua-parser-js’, with millions of weekly downloads, was compromised by attackers. For a period of four hours, the actors managed to take over the developer’s NPM account and inserted malicious code into three versions of the NPM library. The library, which is used to parse user agent strings and identify its browser, operating system, CPU and more, is used in thousands of projects, including ones owned by Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Slack. Therefore, the supply chain attack, in which compromised packages of the library were distributed instead of the legitimate one, enabled threat actors to install malware on a large number of infected devices. In this case, Linux and Windows devices were infected with crypto-miners and password-stealers. 

Another prominent incident took place in November, when multiple Greek shipping companies were hit by ransomware. This was after a common IT service provider, Danaos Management Consultants, was compromised in a supply chain attack. The incident crippled the shipping companies’ communication channels, interrupting contact with other ships, suppliers, and agents, and also led to data loss. 

Due to the scale of the distribution of the library, Log4Shell is referred to as the most critical vulnerability of 2021, with the full scope of the damage yet to be determined. The Apache Foundation released a patch for the RCE vulnerability, but nevertheless, mass scanning of vulnerable servers has been observed by multiple security vendors. The exploit rate of the Log4j flaw has been unusually high since shortly after its exposure. Check Point Research detected approximately 40,000 attack attempts 2 hours after the Log4j vulnerability was revealed and 830,000 attack attempts 72 hours into the event.

The vulnerability could potentially allow threat actors to access any system using the library, including systems that are used to manage client networks and resources. The potential damage that could be caused by this one vulnerability in an open source library demonstrates the immense risk posed by software supply chains, especially in cases where an underfunded project, run by several part-time volunteers, is a key component that thousands of multi-million computer systems rely on worldwide.

Just when we thought we had finished summarizing the Supply Chain landscape for 2021, the Log4j zero-day vulnerability was exposed. The Apache logging package Log4j is the most popular Java logging library with over 400,000 daily downloads, and is incorporated into millions of Java-based applications worldwide. Companies using Log4j as a logging package include Cisco, Twitter, Cloudflare, Tesla, Amazon, Apple and more. The Log4j package logs error messages; according to the Apache Foundation advisory, an attacker who can control log messages or their parameters could execute arbitrary code from an external server via multiple protocols when message lookup substitution is enabled. Only a single string of text is needed to exploit the flaw.

Since its discovery on December 9, the ‘Log4Shell’ flaw, has been actively exploited in the wild. The vulnerability, assigned CVE-2021-44228, could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute malicious code or take over any system that uses the vulnerable version of an open-source library. Unsurprisingly, it scored a perfect 10 out of 10 in the CVSS rating system. 

### The Fallout of Cyber Attacks

It’s no secret that a cyberattack, whether targeted or widely distributed, can have a dramatic impact on organizational performance, data integrity, customer success, long-term reputation and, of course, finances. Naturally, attacks targeting critical infrastructure can paralyze an organization’s routine as well as its entire supply chain. In 2021, we witnessed an unusually high number of attacks that led to disruptions to individuals’ day-to-day lives, and in some cases even threatened their sense of physical security. Whether they are financially or ideologically driven, threat actors are constantly looking for additional leverage and new ways to increase the pressure placed on their victims.

> As outlined in our mid-year report, incidents of cyberattacks are increasing across the board as threat actors take advantage of changing circumstances and hurried digital transformation efforts. As of this report, Cyberattacks are up by an average of 50% when compared with last year's data, but the education and research sectors appear to have suffered the greatest blow, weathering an average of 1,605 attacks on a weekly basis.”

<br>

One of this year’s most significant attacks, which perfectly demonstrates the above, is a ransomware incident that took place in May. The operation targeted the Colonial Pipeline fuel company which delivers fuel to the Southeast coast of the United States. The incident forced the company to shut down their operations, increasing gasoline prices and causing a major supply shortage on the East Coast. This chain of events eventually triggered a rush of panic buying as many gas stations completely ran out of fuel. Government officials pleaded with the public not to rush to gas stations, as people were actually attempting to fill plastic bags with gasoline to avoid running out. A single day after the attack took place, Colonial Pipeline had no choice but to pay the US$ 5 million ransom to the DarkSide ransomware gang who led the attack in order to unlock their systems.

In the same month, JBS S.A, the world’s largest meat processing company, fell victim to an attack by the REvil ransomware group. The Brazilian company distributes meat products made in 150 industrial plants in 15 countries, and has approximately 150,000 employees worldwide. The attack that hit the company network impacted slaughterhouses and meat supplies in the US, Canada and Australia and caused more than 3000 workers’ shifts to be canceled. All of its US beef plants and meat packing facilities, responsible for almost a quarter of American meat supplies, ceased production while The White House assigned the FBI to investigate. In Australia, some abattoirs were completely shut down, forcing the company to furlough 7,000 employees. Eventually, with the fear of price inflation combined with massive unemployment, the CEO of JBS USA, a subsidiary of JBS S.A., announced that the company paid the cybercriminals a ransom equivalent to US$ 11 million in BTC. 

The education sector was also heavily impacted. In 2021, it was the most targeted sector globally, with a 75% increase compared to 2020 and an average of almost 1,605 attack weekly attempts per organization. The disruption suffered by educational institutions impacted students, professors and other staff members. Howard University in Washington D.C fell victim to a ransomware attack in September and was forced to suspend classes to conduct a thorough investigation of their network together with an audit of the student and staff devices. Similarly, The Lewis and Clark Community College in Illinois was hit by a ransomware attack in November that affected their online learning platform as well as other critical systems. They had to close all their campuses, and cancel extra-curricular activities including sporting events taking place in their facilities. The FBI released an alert against the PYSA ransomware that targets higher education institutions in the US and the UK. 

The healthcare sector has also been heavily targeted by cybercriminals since the start of the pandemic, as hospitals, research facilities involved in the development of vaccines, and pharmaceutical companies all prove tempting targets due to the time-sensitive nature of their work. In October, a devastating ransomware attack took place against the healthcare system of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. As a result, employee and patient data was stolen and key systems were taken down for more than a week, leading to a delay in thousands of appointments, including chemotherapy, as almost all non-emergency services and procedures were canceled within the province. That same month, we witnessed one of the first ransomware attacks against a hospital in the Middle East, as the Chinese group DeepBlueMagic targeted the Hillel Yaffe Medical Center in Hadera, Israel, with a custom ransomware. The attack incapacitated computers and some of the hospital infrastructure, making discharging and processing patients impossible due to the inability to retrieve patient files and register new ones. In December, the Behavioral Health Group (BHG), which maintains over 80 Opioid treatment clinics throughout the US, suffered a cyber-attack that disrupted its network for a week. In some centers, patients were prevented from getting their prescribed take-home dosage of medicine to treat narcotic addiction as the computers were not available to print prescription labels, potentially harming their sensitive anti-addiction treatment.

Ideologically driven hackers also managed to cause public disruption, particularly in Iran. First, the Iranian railways infrastructure faced a cyberattack back in July in which hackers displayed messages about train delays or cancellations on information boards at stations across the country, urging passengers to call a number (which belonged to the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei’s office) for more information. The attack severely disrupted train operations the same day and spread fear and confusion among the public. Check Point Research investigated and attributed the attack to the Indra group which opposes the regime and has been active since at least 2019, known for its use of wiper malware.

Finally, in mid-2021, the Grief ransomware attacked several school districts in the US, among them a school district in Mississippi. The ransomware stole 10GB of data including personal and professional information, and has threatened to publish the data unless it is paid. Institutions of higher learning such as universities and colleges make good targets for cyber-criminals because their systems, which allow students and faculty to connect their personal devices to the institution’s network, aren’t fully protected. 

In October, a massive cyber-attack disrupted 4,300 Iranian gas stations, targeting the electronic cards system which allows people to buy gas with government subsidies. On the screen, consumers who tried to fill their tank found the notice “cyberattack 64411”, Iran’s Supreme Leader’s phone number (the same one exposed in the train attack). The incident caused a great deal of disorder with long lines of people at gas stations fearing shortages and sudden price increases. 

All of the attacks described above had a substantial impact on a particular target sector and region. They also gained a lot of media attention, which naturally plays right into the hands of cybercriminals in their attempts to plant fear and gain leverage over their victims. Unfortunately, as 2021 has demonstrated, cyberattacks often have a much wider effect on the general population than the attackers may have originally intended.

### Cloud Services Under Attack

In 2020, the global pandemic brought significant changes to the corporate work environment as well as corporate network architecture. Within those changes, both the shift to cloud-based architecture – meant to address the need for hybrid, remotely-managed networks – and the preference for as-a-service providers over traditional suppliers, have really stood out in terms of the scale of their adoption. Subsequently, in 2021, it became clear that cloud environments were also growing in popularity among end users. By mid-year, Gartner had released its forecast stating that end-user spending on public cloud services was estimated to grow by 23% in 2021 to over US$ 332 billion, compared to US$ 270 billion in 2020 and US$ 242.7 billion in 2019. Enterprises are now allocating large-scale funds to multi-cloud architectures, with Microsoft Azure and AWS leading in popularity, and Google Cloud Platform, IBM, VMWare and others dominating a respectable share of the market.

ITAI GREENBERG
VP, Product Management

> It’s understandable that businesses are increasing their dependence on the cloud, particularly as we move into a post-pandemic ‘new normal’ in which hybrid working will play a key part for many sectors. But shifting productivity onto the cloud also means that businesses are relying more and more on vendors to manage their databases, proprietary code and organizational resources, many of them with in-house knowledge gaps that they’re now working hard to fill. Filling those gaps should be a number one objective for businesses in 2022, helping them to leverage their relationship with cloud vendors to their fullest potential in terms of security, compliance and risk.”

<br>

Naturally, organizations are becoming increasingly dependent on cloud vendors to securely manage their databases, proprietary code, and organizational resources. These organizations are now gradually filling in the platform and role management knowledge gaps formed during the rapid shift to cloud-based environments during 2020, leading to better security and more comprehensive administration. IAM (Identity and Access Management) Role Assumption attacks, aimed at elevating privileges after obtaining unauthorized access, however, continue to be a significant concern. 

As usual, threat actors continue to race against the security research community, looking for new vulnerabilities and exploits. Since late 2021, we have witnessed a wave of attacks leveraging flaws in the services of industry-leading cloud service providers to gain control over an organization’s cloud infrastructure, or, potentially, the organization’s entire database which stores proprietary, customer and financial information. The flaws under discussion are not trust logic flaws – permission-based flaws that derive from the organization’s role policy that are used by threat actors to gradually escalate privileges within the environment. Instead, we’re dealing with critical vulnerabilities in the cloud infrastructure itself, which can allow full takeover of accounts or arbitrary code execution. 

The trend is led by the infamous OMIGOD flaw attacks. In September, researchers found four critical vulnerabilities in OMI (Open Management Infrastructure), one of Microsoft Azure’s software agents that allows users to manage configurations across remote and local environments. OMI is deployed on Azure Linux VMs embedded into multiple Azure services and is deployed automatically when some services are enabled – which makes these flaws highly likely to be exploited. An estimated 65% of all Azure customers are vulnerable, which translates to thousands of organizations and millions of end-point devices. OMIGOD flaws are easy to exploit, as only a single request with the authentication header removed, is needed. Together, the vulnerabilities could enable actors to execute remote arbitrary code within a vulnerable network and escalate to root privileges. Microsoft already issued a patch to address the flaws as part of their September 2021 release. However, some researchers warned that the company’s automatic fix was ineffective for several days, until it was repaired. Attacks leveraging these flaws, in particular the 9.8-rated RCE flaw, assigned CVE-2021-38647, have already been observed as of the time of exposure and have increased rapidly ever since. Servers scanning for vulnerable devices spiked from around 10 to more than 100 during the first weekend alone. The notorious Mirai IoT (Internet-of-Things) botnet was one of the first to target vulnerable devices, and the malware attempted to close port 5896 (the OMI SSL port) to keep other actors from taking advantage of the attack. Attacks aiming to deploy crypto miners onto unpatched Linux devices were also observed.

Another alarming flaw in Microsoft Azure was exposed a month earlier, in August. This time, the vulnerability, dubbed ‘ChaosDB’, was found in Azure Cosmos DB, a multi-model NoSQL database used by some of the top global businesses out there, such as Coca Cola, Skype, and Symantec, to manage large-scale databases including financial transaction information. The flaw enables an actor to retrieve several internal keys used to obtain root privileges that eventually enable it to manage the organization’s databases and accounts. Simply put, by exploiting this flaw, attackers can gain complete and unrestricted control of the entire cloud resources of all Azure Cosmos DB clients.

Yet another breach in Microsoft Azure was discovered towards the end of the year. The flaw, called ‘Azurescape’, affects Azure’s Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform and relies on a two-year-old vulnerability assigned CVE-2019-5736 in RunC, a container runtime. Uniquely, Azurescape is a cross-account vulnerability: it allows an attacker to break out of the breached environment and execute code on environments belonging to other users in the same public cloud service. This means that a malicious user of the Azure Container Instances (ACI) could potentially run arbitrary code on other clients’ Kubernetes clusters. Exploitation of the flaw consists of three stages, beginning with container escape, which is a privilege escalation technique for container environments. Azurescape enables an attacker to gain administrative privileges over an entire cluster of containers. Thankfully, a patch was swiftly released when the flaw was first exposed, but further action by ACI users is also required. As of late 2021, no exploits were detected. The flaw, however, has raised awareness to the dangers posed by multi-tenant cloud environments, common large-scale infrastructures that host multiple organizations on a single platform. 

Microsoft Azure is not the only service in which security flaws were discovered in the past year. In June, researchers uncovered a vulnerability in Google’s Compute Engine (GCE), an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) component of Google Cloud Platform which is used to create and launch virtual machines on demand. The flaw enables an attacker to
