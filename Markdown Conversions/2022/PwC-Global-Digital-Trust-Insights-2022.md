today and tomorrow

2022 Global Digital Trust Insights

Investments continue to pour into cybersecurity. 

More than 25% expect double\-digit growth in cyber budgets in 2022

Sixty\-nine percent of organisations predict a rise 

in cyber spending in 2022 compared to 55% last 

year. More than a quarter (26%) predict cyber 

spending hikes of 10% or more; only 8% percent 

said that last year. 

Organisations know that risks are increasing. 

More than 50% expect a surge in reportable 

incidents next year above 2021 levels.

Already, 2021 is shaping up to be one of the 

worst on record for cybersecurity. Ever more 

sophisticated attackers are plumbing the dark 

corners of our systems and networks, seeking 

— and finding — vulnerabilities. Whatever the 

nature of an organisation’s digital Achilles’ heel 

— an unprotected server containing 50 million 

records, for example, or a flaw in the code 

controlling access to crypto wallets — attackers 

will use every means at their disposal, traditional 

as well as ultra\-sophisticated, to exploit it. 

The consequences for an attack rise as our 

systems’ interdependencies grow more and 

more complex. Critical infrastructures are 

especially vulnerable. And yet, many of the 

breaches we’re seeing are still preventable with 

sound cyber practices and strong controls.

As digital connections multiply, they form 

increasingly complex webs that grow more 

intricate with each new technology. Having a 

smart phone enables us to carry a variety of 

“devices” — telephone, camera, calendar, TV, 

health tracker, an entire library of books, and so 

much more — in our pocket, simplifying our lives 

in many ways and letting us work on the go. The

Internet of Things lets us perform myriad tasks 

by uttering a simple command, enables factories 

to all but run themselves, and lets our healthcare 

providers monitor our health from a distance.

But the processes needed to manage and 

maintain all these connections — including 

cybersecurity — are getting more complicated, 

too. Runaway complexity evokes the Lernaean 

Hydra from Greek mythology: cut off one head, 

and two grow in its place. 

Is the business world now too complex to 

secure? Leaders are sounding the alarm. 

Some 75% of respondents to our 2022 Global 

Digital Trust Insights Survey say that too 

much avoidable, unnecessary organisational 

complexity poses “concerning” cyber and 

privacy risks.

But because some complexities are necessary , 

your enterprise shouldn’t streamline and simplify 

its operations and processes thoughtlessly, but 

consciously and deliberately. 

This 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights Survey 

offers the C\-suite a guide to simplifying cyber with 

intention. It focuses on four questions that tend to 

get short shrift but, if properly considered, can 

yield significant dividends.

These questions may surprise and even challenge 

you because, in a survey about data trust, they 

aren’t technology\-centered. Tech, in itself, is not 

the answer to simplified security. 

Our focus, instead, is on working together as a 

unified whole, from the tech stack to the board 

room — starting at the top with the CEO. Security 

is a concern for the entire business, in every 

function and for every employee.

1\. How can CEOs make a difference to your 

organisation?

2\. Is your organisation too complex to secure? 

3\. How do you know if you’re securing your 

organisation against the most important risks 

to your business? 

4\. How well do you know your third\-party and 

supply chain risks? 

Based on respondents’ answers to these 

questions, we determined the top 10% of 

organisations that are most advanced in their 

practices. These most advanced are twice 

as likely to report significant progress on 

important cyber goals: instilling a culture 

of cybersecurity, managing cyber risk, 

enhancing communication between boards and 

management, and coordinating cyber strategy 

with business strategy.

Organisations with the most advanced practices are twice as likely

Multiplying the effect: simplifying 
moves that get you 5x or more results 

Strategists and technologists have touted 

the potential of digital business models to 

boost business 10x — a Holy Grail promise 

of exponential returns on digital investments. 

Likewise, the Survey reveals how simplifying 

business processes and operations can have a 

“multiplier” effect on security and privacy. 

Here are the four Ps to realising your full cyber 

potential, as exemplified by most advanced and 

most improved organisations, who employ 

them all. 

As common\-sense as these precepts 

and practices might seem, they’re not 

commonplace. Only the top 10% have 

adopted them and they also report making 

significant progress toward their cyber 

objectives during the past two years. 

On the other hand, many enterprises 

continue to struggle amid risky, runaway, 

befuddling complexity. Bad habits are 

often why: Using many tech solutions that, 

too often, don’t even work together. Not

Base: Non\-CEO Respondents: 2,929; CEO Respondents: 673 
Source: PwC, 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights, October 2021\.

Make ‘simply secure’ your business 
mantra 

Cyber has got CEOs’ attention, but are they 

taking action?

Chief executives cited cyber threats as the 

number\-two risk to business prospects in PwC’s 

24th Annual Global CEO Survey — topped only 

by pandemics and other health crises. In North 

America and Western Europe, cyber was 

number one. 

Our findings from the 2022 Global Digital Trust 

Insights Survey suggest an “expectations gap” 

for cyber, with CEOs perceiving that they are 

more involved in, and supportive of, setting and 

achieving cyber goals than their teams do. A 

persistent gap can spell disaster if it instills a false 

sense of security company\-wide, given the CEO’s 

leading role in defining an organisation’s culture.

How involved are CEOs in cyber? We asked 

nearly 700 CEOs and 2,900 other C\-suite execs. 

themselves as more involved in cybersecurity 

than others in the organisation do. 

Many CEOs self\-identify as engaged and 

strategic in their approaches to cyber. Our 

CEO respondents indicate that they participate 

in discussions about the cyber and privacy 

implications of mergers and acquisitions, future 

changes to their operating model, and 

future strategy.

Other executives don’t view things in quite the 

same way. Non\-CEOs rated their CEOs as more 

reactive than proactive regarding cybersecurity. 

They say the chief executive is most likely to 

take part in cyber and privacy matters after a 

company breach or when contacted by 

regulators — not before.

significant support for “ensuring adequate 

resources, funding and sufficient priority” to cyber, 

while only 30% of non\-CEOs agreed that their 

CEOs do so. 

And 34% of CEOs say they provide significant 

help to cyber leadership with “reducing investors’ 

uncertainty regarding organisational cyber risks” 

— while just 29% of non\-CEOs agree. Thirty\-

six percent of CEOs say they empower their 

cyber leadership to connect with customers and 

business partners, while only 30% of non\-CEOs 

say cyber gets that kind of support. 

CEOs matter. CEOs in our “most improved” 

group (those with the best cybersecurity 

outcomes over the past two years) are 14x more 

likely to provide significant support across all 

categories. Similarly, the non\-CEOs in the most 

improved group are 12x more likely to say their 

CEOs provide that significant boost.

The CEO’s engagement and support wield long\-

term importance. Executives in most regions and 

industries say the most important act for a more 

secure digital society by 2030 is educating CEOs 

and boards so they can better fulfill their cyber 

duties and responsibilities. 

It’s time to close the expectations gap between 

the chief executives and the others in the C\-suite 

regarding the level of CEO involvement and 

support of cybersecurity. Things seem headed in 

the right direction: Interactions with the CEO on 

cyber matters have increased significantly in the 

past two years, according to 46% of our survey 

respondents.

CEOs and other executives agree on 
the changing cyber mission 

Cybersecurity’s mission is shifting to developing trust and business 
growth

Asked how CEOs frame the cyber mission in their 

organisation, more than half (54%) of the CEOs 

chose bigger\-picture, growth\-related objectives 

from their security team, as opposed to narrower, 

shorter\-term expectations.

Non\-CEOs echoed this mindset. In both groups, 

“a way to establish trust with our customers with 

respect to how we use their data ethically and 

protect their data” was the number\-one cyber 

mission choice. CEOs really do set the tone for 

the rest of the organisation.

CEOs and non\-CEOs name similar top goals for 

cyber in the next three years. These objectives 

mirror the famous Maslow’s hierarchy of 

needs, with prevention as the baseline, or most 

important; resilience coming next; followed 

by trust (including consumer trust: “improved 

customer experience” and “higher customer 

loyalty” rank fifth and seventh, respectively). 

Protection, resilience and trust comprise the three

How can CEOs make a difference to 
their organisation’s cybersecurity? 

The top 10% that are “most advanced” in cyber 

practices or “most improved” on cyber outcomes 

are in a good position. But the majority overall 

— 63% of organisations — don’t get the kind of 

support they need from their CEO. The fact is, 

both the CEO and CISO need to work together 

better to benefit the company. 

A related CEO imperative: empowering your 

CISO to carry out the cybersecurity mission, 

voicing support and providing resources for 

secure\-by\-design, secure\-by\-default processes. 

Some may add the CISO to the C\-suite. Others 

may help the CISO communicate more with 

the board or revamp the enterprise’s structure 

to embed security staff on business teams. 

Empowering CISOs may also mean giving them 

the platform to speak outside the organisation to 

customers about its security and privacy initiatives,

A powerful CEO move: making an explicit 

statement establishing an imperative for 

security and privacy organisation\-wide. In 

some cases, the organisation’s mission statement 

is already implicitly supportive, such as Liberty 

Mutual’s mission statement to “help people live 

safer, more secure lives.” Red Bull’s dedication 

to distinguished products and services gives its 

CISO the mandate to make security an integral

Takeaways 

For the CEO

• Frame cybersecurity as important to business growth and customer trust — not just defense and controls — to create a security 

mindset organisation\-wide. 

• Demonstrate your trust in and steadfast support for your CISO. 

• Come to grips with the problems and risks in your business models and change what needs to be changed. You’ll have lots of 

opportunities to follow Peter Drucker’s advice: “Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.” 

For the CISO

• Familiarise yourself with your organisation’s business strategy. 

• Build a stronger relationship with your CEO, and keep the dialogue going to help your CEO clear the way for simply secure practices.

• Equip yourself with the skills you need to thrive in the evolving, expanding role for cyber in business. And reorient your teams, if you 

haven’t already, towards business value and customer trust.

areas in your organisation? 
Base: 3,602 respondents

In an overly complex organisation, it’s easy for the 

left hand not to know what the right hand is doing 

— and the consequences for cybersecurity and 

privacy can be dire. Seventy\-five percent of C\-suite 

respondents to our survey, including CISOs, 

say their companies are too complex, avoidably 

and unnecessarily so, and nearly as many say 

complexity poses “concerning” cyber and privacy 

risks to their organisations in 11 key areas.

Data seems to be a chief point of concern, 

especially among large companies (revenues of $1 

billion or more). Data governance (77%) and the 

data infrastructure (77%) ranked highest among 

areas of “unnecessary and avoidable” complexity. 

Technology networks and devices are also highly 

complex, particularly in large companies and North 

American companies. Digital\-native companies 

— those that exist entirely online — tend to use 

the newest technologies, which are designed 

to connect and operate together. Most other 

companies’ technology architectures, which include 

legacy systems, are more complicated. Mergers 

with other entities may multiply risks by connecting 

already complex networks and systems. 

The most worried about all this complexity are 

CEOs. They assign a complexity level of 10 to 

seven of 11 areas in their organisations. CEOs 

tend to be more concerned about cyber and 

privacy risks arising from complexities in the cloud 

environment, governance of tech investments, and 

crossover from IT to operational technology (OT). 

Executives in large organisations and in North 

America are more likely to be concerned about 

risks from complexities in the cloud environment 

and the crossover from IT to OT.

Complexity isn’t bad in and of itself. Often, it’s 

a by\-product of business growth. The larger an 

organisation, the more complex it will naturally be, 

needing more people and technologies to serve a 

growing customer base. 

The costs of creating unnecessary complexity 

are not obvious, and it’s hard to create urgency 

around combatting complexity — that is, until an 

attack occurs. 

One company needlessly kept the sensitive data 

of people it no longer did business with, making 

that data available for hackers to steal. 

In our article Simplifying cyber, we give examples 

of how simplification can improve security. At a 

global retail organisation, six vendors managed 

customer contacts. Two of those vendors’ 

systems had been breached in the past. After 

consulting with the CEO and board, the new 

operations director whittled the vendor list to two. 

This simplification improved security: Monitoring 

two vendors is easier than keeping tabs on six, 

making information access easier to control, and 

the retailer could more readily back up the smaller 

cache of customer data.

Asked to name the top consequences of 

operational complexity, our respondents named:

1\. Financial losses due to successful data 

breaches or cyber attacks.

2\. Inability to innovate as quickly as the market 

opportunities allow.

3\. Lack of operational resilience, or the 

ability to recover from a cyber attack or 

technology failure.

Complexity not only threatens today’s fortunes, 

in the view of executives. It also prevents 

organisations from creating new opportunities 

quickly and pursuing future ones.

The move to simplification 

Simpliﬁcation in organisations: 3 in 10 have streamlined over the last 
two years

Businesses know the risks of complexity, yet 

only 35% of our respondents have performed 

any streamlining of their operations and a quarter 

say they’ve done nothing at all or are just getting 

started. But a shift appears to be underway. 

Simplifying an organisation takes time, 

requiring changes in viewpoints and company 

culture. That’s not easy to achieve, but the 

payoffs are mighty. The companies that had 

the best cybersecurity outcomes over the past 

two years (most improved) are 5x more likely to 

have streamlined operations enterprise\-wide. 

They’ve focused on consolidating tech vendors 

(62%), defining/realigning the mix of in\-house and 

managed services (60%), reorganising functions 

and ways of working (59%) and creating an 

integrated data governance framework (58%).

Simplification of cyber. To be fair, simplifying 

cybersecurity can be challenging. Even knowing 

where to begin can be difficult, especially given 

the attacks hitting businesses on every front. 

Asked to prioritise among nine initiatives aimed 

at simplifying cyber programs and processes, 

respondents couldn’t choose, allotting near\-equal 

importance to all of them. CISOs who are building 

layers of control, for defense in depth, are well\-

intentioned but must guard against introducing 

more complexity and cost. More controls don’t 

always make a company more secure. 

Moving to the cloud can help simplify business 

processes and IT architecture, provide flexibility 

and accelerate innovation. Yet companies 

typically waste an average of 35% of their cloud 

budgets on inefficiencies. Runaway complexity 

can quickly result from extensive technology 

options, new architectural approaches, 

complicated service plans, unused capacity and 

confusing billing and pricing, especially when the 

technologies offered are constantly changing. 

Done right, however, cloud transformations 

can be secure, efficient, and successful. Cloud 

security is the top investment priority of our 

survey respondents, as well as in our June 

US\-specific survey. That’s encouraging — but 

only 16% report realising benefits from these 

investments. Thirty\-five percent haven’t fully 

benefited from cloud security investments and 

45% are just starting or planning theirs.

Whether or not you’re using the cloud to simplify, 

minimising and combining your tech stack and 

processes may feel like a bold move. Doing so 

requires asking hard questions and maintaining 

a keep\-it\-simple mindset. To get there, your 

organisation will need security\-minded leadership 

starting at the very top. 

Don’t overlook moves that can have a significant 

impact. For example, two moves — deploying 

two\-factor authentication and putting your remote 

desktop protocol (RDP) behind the firewall — 

can vastly reduce the risks from phishing, which 

remains a popular tactic, by itself, and in tandem 

with malware and ransomware attacks.

Takeaways 

For Operations and Transformation Leaders

Ask: what’s the cyber plan for that? You can ignite major changes — operational and cultural — simply by asking this one question of every business 

executive in charge of a transformation or new business initiative. By placing cybersecurity front\-row\-center, you can avoid the unnecessary and costly 

complexities you may see now, when it’s an afterthought.

Include the CISO and security teams early in cloud migration and adoption, mergers and acquisitions, and other organisational initiatives. That way, every 

executive at the helm of a major business initiative will be able to readily answer the cyber\-plan question. 

For the CISO and CIO 

Dare to subtract. Left on their own, technology and data tend to multiply, divide, and conquer efficiency and security. Whittle down excess with security 

goals in mind: assess your data stores and eliminate everything you don’t need now; move your disparate apps and solutions into a cloud environment for 

easier management; and consolidate, liquidate, and automate where you can. 

Also, rethink your tech and cyber investment processes. Focus first on simplifying where benefits are greatest for the whole organisation.

Are you securing against the most important risks today and tomorrow? 

Fewer than 1 in 3 organisations use available data and intelligence when making decisions. But those that had the best cybersecurity 
outcomes over the past two years are 18x more likely to say data and threat intel are integral to their operating model.

Size up your risks — using data you 
can trust — to realise opportunities 

A foundation for data you can trust for 
better business decisions 

Organisational leaders recognise the importance 

Organisations first need to set up that good 

of verifying and safeguarding their business 

foundation we call data trust: making sure your 

information. Asked to frame the cybersecurity 

data is accurate and verified and secure so you

the CEO frames the cyber mission in 

their organisation.

But only about a third of respondents report 

having mature, fully implemented data\-trust 

Data infrastructure and data governance rank 

processes in four key areas: governance, 

as the two most needlessly complex aspects 

discovery, protection and minimisation. Nearly 

of business operations in PwC’s 2022 Global 

a quarter of our respondents say they have no

“avoidable, unnecessary” levels of complexity. 

About three\-quarters say complexity in these 

areas poses “concerning” risks to cybersecurity 

and privacy. Complexity of data can stymie 

any organisation’s ability to effectively use the 

information it collects and generates. 

Only about one\-third of organisations report 

having a full, formal data governance program — 

a surprisingly low number. Once you’ve crafted 

your data strategy, governance — the policies, 

procedures and processes for fulfilling the 

strategy — should follow immediately. 

Securing your data from tampering as well as 

theft is also critical to success, yet only about 

one\-third of respondents report having in place 

fully implemented, formal data security processes 

including encryption and secure data\-sharing 

(34%). Verifying and protecting the integrity of 

your data is essential as well. Not doing so is 

like hiring workers without fact\-checking their 

resumes. You can’t be certain of the quality of the 

information.

20 \| PwC 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights

And only 35% have mapped all their data, 

meaning they know where it comes from and 

where it goes. The same goes for those who have 

mature data minimisation processes. 

Data is the asset attackers covet most. Your 

companies can minimise that risk by minimising 

the target. You must govern, discover and protect 

only the data you need — and eliminate the rest. 

Drafts, duplicates, superseded data, legacy 

data and employee personal data are common 

candidates for elimination. Low\-value data not 

only creates unnecessary risk, it also crowds out 

or buries your high\-value data.

The two\-thirds of organisations that haven’t 

formally implemented data trust practices may 

be at risk in more ways than one. Effective data 

governance is important not only for operational 

resilience but also for compliance with regulations 

such as the European Union’s General Data 

Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California 

Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). New, more stringent 

regulations loom on the horizon as well. When 

someone asks for information about their data — 

what you’re keeping and what you’re doing with 

it — you’d better be able to answer quickly and 

accurately. If it’s a regulator doing the asking, the 

wrong answer could bring heavy fines. 

Turning data into true assets that can increase 

your revenues is one benefit of good data security 

— as some leading businesses are discovering. 

Our “most improved” are more than 10x more 

likely to have a formal process fully in place for all 

data trust practices.

According to our Trust in Data Survey, companies 

with more mature data trust practices tend to 

be ahead in many respects. They earn revenues 

from data monetisation by personalising services, 

operating more efficiently and better serving 

their customers. They strongly agree that higher 

customer trust leads to demonstrably higher 

revenue. They’ve made significant moves in the 

past year to improve customer and investor trust. 

And they’re more confident in their third\-party risk 

management program because they monitor their 

third parties more.

Use it or lose out 

Executives underutilise data and intel for better decisions and risk 
management 

Chances are good that neither you nor your 

competitors are letting data inform your cyber 

risk management. Fewer than one in three of 

survey respondents say they’ve integrated 

analytics and business intelligence tools into 

their operating model.

These respondents scored lowest in their 

ability to turn data into insights for cyber risk 

quantification, threat modeling, scenario building 

and predictive analysis — all critical technologies 

for smart cybersecurity decisions. 

So many entities fail to benefit from today’s 

advanced intelligence tools and approaches. 

New types of internal data, data from new 

external sources, new data partnerships and 

information\-sharing platforms can be important 

sources of business intelligence, but only about 

a quarter of respondents say they’re reaping 

benefits from these tools.

The other three quarters are missing out. 

Businesses predicting an increase next year 

in their cybersecurity spending are often the 

same enterprises whose operational models 

use business intelligence and data analytics. 

Data can not only help you spend your cyber 

budget wisely, it can also help you get more 

to work with. The most improved (top 10% in 

cyber outcomes) are 18x more likely to state that 

these advanced approaches are integral to their 

operating model.

Question: What are your organisation’s most important reasons to quantify cyber risk? 
Base: 3,602 respondents 
Source: PwC, 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights, October 2021\.

Sizing up risks — and opportunities 

“In today’s system\-of\-systems world, 

cybersecurity can no longer be treated as 

a ‘too\-hard\-to\-measure’ problem,” the US 

Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 

Agency argues. Still, as we saw above, only 26% 

quantify cyber risks today. 

The data you use to spot and understand 

threats, put a dollar figure on risks and prioritise 

them, and predict cybercrime trends can be a 

powerful tool for convincing boards and the CEO 

to invest in your cyber program. On the other 

hand, if you’re having trouble getting the funding 

you need for cyber, you may need to do a better 

job of quantifying your cybersecurity risk.

By the same token, data can help you stay 

apprised of real\-time risks, and adjust security 

tactics and strategies as the business shifts. 

Respondents in five business sectors said the 

most important reason to quantify cyber risk is 

“to continuously evaluate our risk landscape and 

priorities against changing business objectives.” 

Enterprise leaders recognise that risks are 

always in a state of flux and that data is the tool 

that lets them monitor and measure changes.

Sizing up risks is also important for sizing up 

opportunities and linking cyber\-threat narratives 

to business narratives that the C\-suite and 

boards can understand. A growing number 

of organisations recognise the importance of 

cybersecurity to business — but many still have 

a long way to go. Between 37% and 42% claim 

“significant progress” linking the two, while 16% 

to 18% say they’ve made little or no progress 

aligning cyber and business goals.

The 2022 threat outlook 

Our respondents do make predictions about the next 12 months. Sixty percent expect an increase in cybercrime; 53% say nation\-state attacks 

are likely to grow. Mobile, the Internet of Things, and cloud top the list of anticipated targets. But the type of attack could take almost any 

form, in our respondents’ minds. Cloud service attacks (22%) narrowly edged out ransomware (21%) and cryptomining (21%) as most likely 

to see significant increases, and a long line of other attack types scored at 20% and 19%. Notably, 56% expect a rise in breaches via their 

software supply chain, with 19% eyeing significant increases — a number that grows to 25% among North American respondents.

For the CFO

• Work with the CISO in taking a risk\-based approach to cyber budgeting that ties to business objectives.

For the CISO

• Build a strong data trust foundation: an enterprise\-wide approach to data governance, discovery, protection and minimisation.

• Create a roadmap from cyber risk quantification to real\-time cyber risk reporting.

• Don’t stop at cyber risks. Tie the cyber risks to overall enterprise risks and, ultimately, to effects on the business. 

• With a fuller accounting of cyber risks, identify what works in your business model and where you might need to simplify.

over the number of 2020 attacks.

An organisation could be vulnerable to a supply 

chain attack even when its own cyber defences 

are good, with attackers simply finding new 

pathways into the organisation through its 

suppliers. Detecting and stopping a software\-

based attack can be very difficult, and complex 

to unravel. That’s because every component 

of any given software depends on other 

components such as code libraries, packages 

and modules that integrate into the software and 

are necessary for its operation.

The organisations that had the best cyber 

outcomes over the past two years have 

consolidated tech vendors as a simplification 

move. Paring the number of tech and other third 

parties reduces complexity and increases your 

ability to know how secure they are. One benefit 

is that different functions (procurement, risk 

managers, fraud team, legal, security) can better 

understand their roles in protecting their supply 

chains from cyber disruptions. And with fewer 

vendors to monitor, your organisation can more 

efficiently keep an eye on their security practices.

Gaining visibility into the web of third\-party 

relationships and dependencies is a must. Top 

cybersecurity companies integrate solutions (real\-

time threat intelligence, threat hunting, security 

analytics, vulnerability management, intrusion 

detection and response) on broad platforms.

Questions: Thinking about your most significant public\-private collaboration mechanism, what 
are your organisation’s goals with public\-private collaboration? And in the past year, how well has 
your organisation achieved each of those goals you mentioned? 
Base: 3,602 respondents 
Source: PwC, 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights, October 2021\.

Public\-private collaboration 

Visibility also means seeing which challenges 

others face and what they are doing to meet 

them. Collaborators can be an important part 

of your cyber\-business ecosystem. Just ask 

the companies and federal agencies that 

benefited from the public\-private partnership 

and government responses to significant 

cyber incidents early in 2021\. Timely sharing of 

information matters for cybersecurity in general, 

critical infrastructure or not. 

But fewer than one\-third of survey respondents 

said their public\-private collaboration efforts are 

“very effectively” helping them achieve their cyber 

goals. Those who’ve had the best cybersecurity 

outcomes over the past two years, however, were 

34x more likely to have achieved their public\-

private collaboration goals “very effectively.”

Organisations increasing their cyber budgets in 

2022 were significantly likely to say they have 

achieved these goals “very effectively”:

• Share knowledge about new threats, 

approaches, and solutions in my peer set (38%)

• Demonstrate avoidance of tangible financial 

losses (36%)

• Activate public\-private sector relationships 

for more effective responses to a cyber 

attack on our organisation (33%)

• Promote broader awareness and upskilling of 

workforce (32%)

“Very effective” collaborators also include those in 

technology, media and telecommunications; those 

with more than $5 billion in yearly revenues; and, in 

terms of promoting broader cyber awareness and 

upskilling the workforce, female respondents. 

For influencing governments and policymakers on 

proposed rules and regulations, smaller companies 

perceive that they are less effective than larger 

ones. Respondents from organisations with yearly 

revenues under $1 billion were significantly more 

likely to say they are “not very effective” at wielding 

this influence (7%), as opposed to 4% of those 

with revenues greater than $1 billion and 3% of 

those with $5 billion yearly revenues or higher.

Takeaways 

For the COO and the supply chain executive

• Map your system, especially your most critical relationships, and use a third\-party tracker to find the weakest links in your supply chain.

• Scrutinise your software vendors against the performance standards you expect. Software and applications that your company uses 

should undergo the same level of scrutiny and testing that your network devices and users do. The National Institute for Standards and 

Technology published minimum standards for software testing in July 2021\. 

• After a fuller accounting of your third\-party and supply chain risks, identify ways to simplify your business relationships and supply 

chain. Should you pare down? Combine?

For the CRO and CISO

• Build up your technological ability to detect, resist and respond to cyber attacks via your software, and integrate your applications so 

you can manage and secure them in unison.

• Establish a third\-party risk management office to coordinate the activities of all functions that manage your third\-party risk areas.

• Strengthen your data trust processes. Data is the target for most attacks on the supply chain. Data trust and good third\-party risk 

management go hand in hand.

• Educate your board on the cyber and business risks from your third parties and supply chain.
