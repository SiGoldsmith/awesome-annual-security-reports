### Investments Continue to Pour into Cybersecurity

Investments continue to pour into cybersecurity. Sixty-nine percent of organisations predict a rise in cyber spending in 2022 compared to 55% last year. More than a quarter (26%) predict cyber spending hikes of 10% or more; only 8% percent said that last year.  Organisations know that risks are increasing. More than 50% expect a surge in reportable incidents next year above 2021 levels. Already, 2021 is shaping up to be one of the worst on record for cybersecurity. Ever more sophisticated attackers are plumbing the dark corners of our systems and networks, seeking — and finding — vulnerabilities. Whatever the nature of an organisation’s digital Achilles’ heel — an unprotected server containing 50 million records, for example, or a flaw in the code controlling access to crypto wallets — attackers will use every means at their disposal, traditional as well as ultra-sophisticated, to exploit it. The consequences for an attack rise as our systems’ interdependencies grow more and more complex. Critical infrastructures are especially vulnerable. And yet, many of the breaches we’re seeing are still preventable with sound cyber practices and strong controls.

### Simplifying Cyber

As digital connections multiply, they form increasingly complex webs that grow more intricate with each new technology.  Having a smart phone enables us to carry a variety of “devices” — telephone, camera, calendar, TV, health tracker, an entire library of books, and so much more — in our pocket, simplifying our lives in many ways and letting us work on the go. The Internet of Things lets us perform myriad tasks by uttering a simple command, enables factories to all but run themselves, and lets our healthcare providers monitor our health from a distance. But the processes needed to manage and maintain all these connections — including cybersecurity — are getting more complicated, too. Runaway complexity evokes the Lernaean Hydra from Greek mythology: cut off one head, and two grow in its place. Is the business world now too complex to secure? Leaders are sounding the alarm. Some 75% of respondents to our 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights Survey say that too much avoidable, unnecessary organisational complexity poses “concerning” cyber and privacy risks. But because some complexities are necessary, your enterprise shouldn’t streamline and simplify its operations and processes thoughtlessly, but consciously and deliberately. This 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights Survey offers the C-suite a guide to simplifying cyber with intention. It focuses on four questions that tend to get short shrift but, if properly considered, can yield significant dividends.

### Cybersecurity Scorecards

These questions may surprise and even challenge you because, in a survey about data trust, they aren’t technology-centered. Tech, in itself, is not the answer to simplified security. Our focus, instead, is on working together as a unified whole, from the tech stack to the board room — starting at the top with the CEO. Security is a concern for the entire business, in every function and for every employee.

1. How can CEOs make a difference to your organisation?
2. Is your organisation too complex to secure?
3. How do you know if you’re securing your organisation against the most important risks to your business?
4. How well do you know your third-party and supply chain risks?

Based on respondents’ answers to these questions, we determined the top 10% of organisations that are most advanced in their practices. These most advanced are twice as likely to report significant progress on important cyber goals: instilling a culture of cybersecurity, managing cyber risk, enhancing communication between boards and management, and coordinating cyber strategy with business strategy.

![Image description]

The top 10% reporting significant progress toward meeting these goals — the most improved — are many times more likely to be doing the right things.


### Multiplying the Effect: Simplifying Moves That Get You 5x or More Results

Strategists and technologists have touted the potential of digital business models to boost business 10x — a Holy Grail promise of exponential returns on digital investments. Likewise, the Survey reveals how simplifying business processes and operations can have a “multiplier” effect on security and privacy. Here are the four Ps to realising your full cyber potential, as exemplified by most advanced and most improved organisations, who employ them all.

* **Principle.** The CEO must articulate an explicit, unambiguous foundational principle establishing security and privacy as a business imperative.
* **People.** Hire the right leader, and let CISO and security teams connect with the business teams. Your people can be vanguards of simplification even as you build “good complexity” in the business.
* **Prioritisation.** Your risks continually change as your digital ambitions rise. Use data and intelligence to measure your risks continually, as well.
* **Perception.** You can’t secure what you can’t see. Uncover blind spots in your relationships and supply chains.

As common-sense as these precepts and practices might seem, they’re not commonplace. Only the top 10% have adopted them and they also report making significant progress toward their cyber objectives during the past two years. On the other hand, many enterprises continue to struggle amid risky, runaway, befuddling complexity. Bad habits are often why: Using many tech solutions that, too often, don’t even work together. Not coordinating the work of various functions on resilience or third-party risk management. Not creating and adhering to processes for dealing with data (governance). Not speaking in the language of business when talking about cyber. Businesses develop these bad habits in the name of speed, or they accept and assimilate them out of resistance to change. The good thing, however, is that bad habits can be broken. And C-suite champions can help develop new habits of coordination and collaboration among all functions, business and tech, for an organisation that’s simply secure.


### Can the CEO Make a Difference to Your Organisation’s Cybersecurity?

Chief executives at companies that had the best cybersecurity outcomes over the past two years are 14x more likely to provide significant and broad support to cybersecurity.

Make ‘simply secure’ your business mantra

Cyber has got CEOs’ attention, but are they taking action? Chief executives cited cyber threats as the number-two risk to business prospects in PwC’s 24th Annual Global CEO Survey — topped only by pandemics and other health crises. In North America and Western Europe, cyber was number one. Our findings from the 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights Survey suggest an “expectations gap” for cyber, with CEOs perceiving that they are more involved in, and supportive of, setting and achieving cyber goals than their teams do. A persistent gap can spell disaster if it instills a false sense of security company-wide, given the CEO’s leading role in defining an organisation’s culture.

How involved are CEOs in cyber? We asked nearly 700 CEOs and 2,900 other C-suite execs. Among our respondents, CEOs tend to see themselves as more involved in cybersecurity than others in the organisation do. Many CEOs self-identify as engaged and strategic in their approaches to cyber. Our CEO respondents indicate that they participate in discussions about the cyber and privacy implications of mergers and acquisitions, future changes to their operating model, and future strategy. Other executives don’t view things in quite the same way. Non-CEOs rated their CEOs as more reactive than proactive regarding cybersecurity. They say the chief executive is most likely to take part in cyber and privacy matters after a company breach or when contacted by regulators — not before.

### How Much Support Does the CEO Provide CISO Leadership?

CEOs were more likely than non-CEOs to rate as “significant” their level of support in six areas. For instance, 37% of CEOs said they provide significant support for “ensuring adequate resources, funding and sufficient priority” to cyber, while only 30% of non-CEOs agreed that their CEOs do so. And 34% of CEOs say they provide significant help to cyber leadership with “reducing investors’ uncertainty regarding organisational cyber risks” — while just 29% of non-CEOs agree. Thirty-six percent of CEOs say they empower their cyber leadership to connect with customers and business partners, while only 30% of non-CEOs say cyber gets that kind of support. CEOs matter. CEOs in our “most improved” group (those with the best cybersecurity outcomes over the past two years) are 14x more likely to provide significant support across all categories. Similarly, the non-CEOs in the most improved group are 12x more likely to say their CEOs provide that significant boost. The CEO’s engagement and support wield long-term importance. Executives in most regions and industries say the most important act for a more secure digital society by 2030 is educating CEOs and boards so they can better fulfill their cyber duties and responsibilities. It’s time to close the expectations gap between the chief executives and the others in the C-suite regarding the level of CEO involvement and support of cybersecurity. Things seem headed in the right direction: Interactions with the CEO on cyber matters have increased significantly in the past two years, according to 46% of our survey respondents.

### CEOs and Other Executives Agree on the Changing Cyber Mission

Asked how CEOs frame the cyber mission in their organisation, more than half (54%) of the CEOs chose bigger-picture, growth-related objectives from their security team, as opposed to narrower, shorter-term expectations. Non-CEOs echoed this mindset. In both groups, “a way to establish trust with our customers with respect to how we use their data ethically and protect their data” was the number-one cyber mission choice. CEOs really do set the tone for the rest of the organisation. CEOs and non-CEOs name similar top goals for cyber in the next three years. These objectives mirror the famous Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, with prevention as the baseline, or most important; resilience coming next; followed by trust (including consumer trust: “improved customer experience” and “higher customer loyalty” rank fifth and seventh, respectively). Protection, resilience and trust comprise the three legs of the cybersecurity stool, each important for the security of the business overall.

Cybersecurity’s mission is shifting to developing trust and business growth

Top goals are:

* Increased prevention of successful attacks (this ranks number three in the energy and utilities sector)
* Faster response times to incidents and disruptions
* Improved confidence of leaders in the organisation’s ability to manage present and future threats (number one in energy, utilities, and resources)


### How Can CEOs Make a Difference to Their Organisation’s Cybersecurity?

The top 10% that are “most advanced” in cyber practices or “most improved” on cyber outcomes are in a good position. But the majority overall — 63% of organisations — don’t get the kind of support they need from their CEO. The fact is, both the CEO and CISO need to work together better to benefit the company.

CEO: How much should you be involved in your organisation’s cybersecurity — without taking on undue burden? A powerful CEO move: making an explicit statement establishing an imperative for security and privacy organisation-wide. In some cases, the organisation’s mission statement is already implicitly supportive, such as Liberty Mutual’s mission statement to “help people live safer, more secure lives.” Red Bull’s dedication to distinguished products and services gives its CISO the mandate to make security an integral part of the product and service quality delivered to customers. A related CEO imperative: empowering your CISO to carry out the cybersecurity mission, voicing support and providing resources for secure-by-design, secure-by-default processes. Some may add the CISO to the C-suite. Others may help the CISO communicate more with the board or revamp the enterprise’s structure to embed security staff on business teams. Empowering CISOs may also mean giving them the platform to speak outside the organisation to customers about its security and privacy initiatives, as a trust officer would.

This period of great complexity in the business world demands a third CEO imperative. The CEO must modify certain elements of the company’s business and/or operating models to make the company “simply secure” when the security team identifies wasteful habits. For example, in the name of speed, a “get to market first, fix security later” mindset prevails. Companies aren’t fully mitigating remote work risks. Business units often buy technologies and contract with third parties autonomously. Cybersecurity is too often an afterthought in cloud adoption or transformation. By taking action, the CEO reinforces a zero-tolerance mentality for complexity that gets in the way of security.

CISO: How well do you understand the business? How connected are you with leaders on the business side? For an organisation that’s simply secure, CISOs must move out of the technology trenches and broaden their outreach — learning from the CFO how to talk about the financial implications of risk, for example, in a language the board understands, or working with the product manager to devise developer-friendly ways to secure applications. This change may require a mindset shift for many CISOs. CISOs interact most frequently with the CIO and chief technology officer, our survey shows, and least frequently with the chief marketing officer and product management leader. The CFO also ranks low on the interactions list. CISO will need to spend more time with these business partners to begin to speak their language and better understand their business imperatives. More than 21% placed the CEO among the three positions with whom they least come in contact; some 10% placed the CEO at the very bottom of the list. The CEO-CISO divide is widest in Europe: 27% of CISOs in western Europe and 28% in eastern Europe placed their chief executive among the bottom three with whom they interact, followed by Asia Pacific (21%) and North America (19%).


### Is Your Organisation Too Complex to Secure?

75% say their organisations are too complex. But those that had the best cybersecurity outcomes over the past two years are 5x more likely to have streamlined operations enterprise-wide.

Be deliberate about simplicity and simplification

In an overly complex organisation, it’s easy for the left hand not to know what the right hand is doing — and the consequences for cybersecurity and privacy can be dire. Seventy-five percent of C-suite respondents to our survey, including CISOs, say their companies are too complex, avoidably and unnecessarily so, and nearly as many say complexity poses “concerning” cyber and privacy risks to their organisations in 11 key areas. Data seems to be a chief point of concern, especially among large companies (revenues of $1 billion or more). Data governance (77%) and the data infrastructure (77%) ranked highest among areas of “unnecessary and avoidable” complexity. Technology networks and devices are also highly complex, particularly in large companies and North American companies. Digital-native companies — those that exist entirely online — tend to use the newest technologies, which are designed to connect and operate together. Most other companies’ technology architectures, which include legacy systems, are more complicated. Mergers with other entities may multiply risks by connecting already complex networks and systems. The most worried about all this complexity are CEOs. They assign a complexity level of 10 to seven of 11 areas in their organisations. CEOs tend to be more concerned about cyber and privacy risks arising from complexities in the cloud environment, governance of tech investments, and crossover from IT to operational technology (OT). Executives in large organisations and in North America are more likely to be concerned about risks from complexities in the cloud environment and the crossover from IT to OT.

### The Costs of Complexity

Complexity isn’t bad in and of itself. Often, it’s a by-product of business growth. The larger an organisation, the more complex it will naturally be, needing more people and technologies to serve a growing customer base. The costs of creating unnecessary complexity are not obvious, and it’s hard to create urgency around combatting complexity — that is, until an attack occurs. One company needlessly kept the sensitive data of people it no longer did business with, making that data available for hackers to steal. In our article Simplifying cyber, we give examples of how simplification can improve security. At a global retail organisation, six vendors managed customer contacts. Two of those vendors’ systems had been breached in the past. After consulting with the CEO and board, the new operations director whittled the vendor list to two. This simplification improved security: Monitoring two vendors is easier than keeping tabs on six, making information access easier to control, and the retailer could more readily back up the smaller cache of customer data. Asked to name the top consequences of operational complexity, our respondents named:

1. Financial losses due to successful data breaches or cyber attacks.
2. Inability to innovate as quickly as the market opportunities allow.
3. Lack of operational resilience, or the ability to recover from a cyber attack or technology failure.

Complexity not only threatens today’s fortunes, in the view of executives. It also prevents organisations from creating new opportunities quickly and pursuing future ones.

![Image description]

In all industries, top consequences of complexity are financial losses, inability to innovate, and lack of resilience


### The Move to Simplification

Businesses know the risks of complexity, yet only 35% of our respondents have performed any streamlining of their operations and a quarter say they’ve done nothing at all or are just getting started. But a shift appears to be underway. Simplifying an organisation takes time, requiring changes in viewpoints and company culture. That’s not easy to achieve, but the payoffs are mighty. The companies that had the best cybersecurity outcomes over the past two years (most improved) are 5x more likely to have streamlined operations enterprise-wide. They’ve focused on consolidating tech vendors (62%), defining/realigning the mix of in-house and managed services (60%), reorganising functions and ways of working (59%) and creating an integrated data governance framework (58%). More and more CISOs and CIOs are taking a hard look at their tech investments, no longer just entertaining or chasing the latest products from tech vendors. We’re seeing consolidation of tech vendors and applications to reverse the hard-to-manage and risky tangle of disparate and vulnerable software and tech stack.

### Simplification of Cyber

To be fair, simplifying cybersecurity can be challenging. Even knowing where to begin can be difficult, especially given the attacks hitting businesses on every front. Asked to prioritise among nine initiatives aimed at simplifying cyber programs and processes, respondents couldn’t choose, allotting near-equal importance to all of them. CISOs who are building layers of control, for defense in depth, are well-intentioned but must guard against introducing more complexity and cost. More controls don’t always make a company more secure. Moving to the cloud can help simplify business processes and IT architecture, provide flexibility and accelerate innovation. Yet companies typically waste an average of 35% of their cloud budgets on inefficiencies. Runaway complexity can quickly result from extensive technology options, new architectural approaches, complicated service plans, unused capacity and confusing billing and pricing, especially when the technologies offered are constantly changing. Done right, however, cloud transformations can be secure, efficient, and successful. Cloud security is the top investment priority of our survey respondents, as well as in our June US-specific survey. That’s encouraging — but only 16% report realising benefits from these investments. Thirty-five percent haven’t fully benefited from cloud security investments and 45% are just starting or planning theirs. Whether or not you’re using the cloud to simplify, minimising and combining your tech stack and processes may feel like a bold move. Doing so requires asking hard questions and maintaining a keep-it-simple mindset. To get there, your organisation will need security-minded leadership starting at the very top. Don’t overlook moves that can have a significant impact. For example, two moves — deploying two-factor authentication and putting your remote desktop protocol (RDP) behind the firewall — can vastly reduce the risks from phishing, which remains a popular tactic, by itself, and in tandem with malware and ransomware attacks.

### Are You Securing Against the Most Important Risks Today and Tomorrow?

Fewer than 1 in 3 organisations use available data and intelligence when making decisions. But those that had the best cybersecurity outcomes over the past two years are 18x more likely to say data and threat intel are integral to their operating model.

Size up your risks — using data you can trust — to realise opportunities

Organisational leaders recognise the importance of verifying and safeguarding their business information. Asked to frame the cybersecurity mission, the number-one response was, “A way to establish trust with our customers with respect to how we use their data ethically and protect their data.” Eighteen percent of CEOs and 20% of non-CEOs selected customer trust as the way the CEO frames the cyber mission in their organisation. Data infrastructure and data governance rank as the two most needlessly complex aspects of business operations in PwC’s 2022 Global Data Trust Insights Survey: 77% say both have “avoidable, unnecessary” levels of complexity. About three-quarters say complexity in these areas poses “concerning” risks to cybersecurity and privacy. Complexity of data can stymie any organisation’s ability to effectively use the information it collects and generates.

A foundation for data you can trust for better business decisions

Organisations first need to set up that good foundation we call data trust: making sure your data is accurate and verified and secure so you can rely on them for business decisions. (And when it comes to customer data, you want to make sure customers know they can trust you to keep their information safe from unauthorised eyes.) But only about a third of respondents report having mature, fully implemented data-trust processes in four key areas: governance, discovery, protection and minimisation. Nearly a quarter of our respondents say they have no formal data-trust processes in place at all. Only about one-third of organisations report having a full, formal data governance program — a surprisingly low number. Once you’ve crafted your data strategy, governance — the policies, procedures and processes for fulfilling the strategy — should follow immediately. Securing your data from tampering as well as theft is also critical to success, yet only about one-third of respondents report having in place fully implemented, formal data security processes including encryption and secure data-sharing (34%). Verifying and protecting the integrity of your data is essential as well. Not doing so is like hiring workers without fact-checking their resumes. You can’t be certain of the quality of the information. And only 35% have mapped all their data, meaning they know where it comes from and where it goes. The same goes for those who have mature data minimisation processes. Data is the asset attackers covet most. Your companies can minimise that risk by minimising the target. You must govern, discover and protect only the data you need — and eliminate the rest. Drafts, duplicates, superseded data, legacy data and employee personal data are common candidates for elimination. Low-value data not only creates unnecessary risk, it also crowds out or buries your high-value data. The two-thirds of organisations that haven’t formally implemented data trust practices may be at risk in more ways than one. Effective data governance is important not only for operational resilience but also for compliance with regulations such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). New, more stringent regulations loom on the horizon as well. When someone asks for information about their data — what you’re keeping and what you’re doing with it — you’d better be able to answer quickly and accurately. If it’s a regulator doing the asking, the wrong answer could bring heavy fines. Turning data into true assets that can increase your revenues is one benefit of good data security — as some leading businesses are discovering. Our “most improved” are more than 10x more likely to have a formal process fully in place for all data trust practices.

According to our Trust in Data Survey, companies with more mature data trust practices tend to be ahead in many respects. They earn revenues from data monetisation by personalising services, operating more efficiently and better serving their customers. They strongly agree that higher customer trust leads to demonstrably higher revenue. They’ve made significant moves in the past year to improve customer and investor trust. And they’re more confident in their third-party risk management program because they monitor their third parties more.

Data trust practices have yet to become the norm


### Use It or Lose Out

Chances are good that neither you nor your competitors are letting data inform your cyber risk management. Fewer than one in three of survey respondents say they’ve integrated analytics and business intelligence tools into their operating model. These respondents scored lowest in their ability to turn data into insights for cyber risk quantification, threat modeling, scenario building and predictive analysis — all critical technologies for smart cybersecurity decisions. So many entities fail to benefit from today’s advanced intelligence tools and approaches. New types of internal data, data from new external sources, new data partnerships and information-sharing platforms can be important sources of business intelligence, but only about a quarter of respondents say they’re reaping benefits from these tools. The other three quarters are missing out. Businesses predicting an increase next year in their cybersecurity spending are often the same enterprises whose operational models use business intelligence and data analytics. Data can not only help you spend your cyber budget wisely, it can also help you get more to work with. The most improved (top 10% in cyber outcomes) are 18x more likely to state that these advanced approaches are integral to their operating model.

### Sizing Up Risks — and Opportunities

“In today’s system-of-systems world, cybersecurity can no longer be treated as a ‘too-hard-to-measure’ problem,” the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency argues. Still, as we saw above, only 26% quantify cyber risks today. The data you use to spot and understand threats, put a dollar figure on risks and prioritise them, and predict cybercrime trends can be a powerful tool for convincing boards and the CEO to invest in your cyber program. On the other hand, if you’re having trouble getting the funding you need for cyber, you may need to do a better job of quantifying your cybersecurity risk. By the same token, data can help you stay apprised of real-time risks, and adjust security tactics and strategies as the business shifts. Respondents in five business sectors said the most important reason to quantify cyber risk is “to continuously evaluate our risk landscape and priorities against changing business objectives.” Enterprise leaders recognise that risks are always in a state of flux and that data is the tool that lets them monitor and measure changes. Sizing up risks is also important for sizing up opportunities and linking cyber-threat narratives to business narratives that the C-suite and boards can understand. A growing number of organisations recognise the importance of cybersecurity to business — but many still have a long way to go. Between 37% and 42% claim “significant progress” linking the two, while 16% to 18% say they’ve made little or no progress aligning cyber and business goals.

### The 2022 Threat Outlook

Our respondents do make predictions about the next 12 months. Sixty percent expect an increase in cybercrime; 53% say nation-state attacks are likely to grow. Mobile, the Internet of Things, and cloud top the list of anticipated targets. But the type of attack could take almost any form, in our respondents’ minds. Cloud service attacks (22%) narrowly edged out ransomware (21%) and cryptomining (21%) as most likely to see significant increases, and a long line of other attack types scored at 20% and 19%. Notably, 56% expect a rise in breaches via their software supply chain, with 19% eyeing significant increases — a number that grows to 25% among North American respondents.

### How Well Do You Know the Risks Posed by Your Third Parties and Supply Chain?

At best, only 40% say they thoroughly understand their third-party cyber and privacy risks. But those that had the best cybersecurity outcomes over the past two years are 11x more likely to say they do.

Shrink the large blind spot hiding the risks in your business relationships

You can’t secure what you can’t see, and most respondents to the PwC 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights Survey seem to have trouble seeing their third-party risks — risks obscured by the complexities of their business partnerships and vendor/supplier networks. Only 40% of survey respondents say they thoroughly understand the risk of data breaches through third parties, using formal enterprise-wide assessments. Nearly a quarter have little or no understanding at all of these risks — a major blind spot of which cyber attackers are well aware and willing to exploit. Among our respondents, 56% expect an increase in reportable incidents in 2022 from attacks on the software supply chain, but only 34% have formally assessed their enterprise’s exposure to this risk. Fifty-seven percent expect a jump in attacks on cloud services, but only 37% profess an understanding of cloud risks based on formal assessments. The “most improved” organisations, on the other hand, have taken note and taken action. They are 11x more likely to report a high understanding of their third-party risks. Some three-quarters say they’re highly knowledgeable about third-party dangers in five of six areas. Only in their knowledge of “nth-party” risks — those posed by their suppliers’ suppliers and so on, down the line — does the number dip: 69% of the “most improved,” 31% for the rest. The more complex the connection, the harder it becomes to see the risks buried within.

![Image description]

Organisations have a large blind spot to risks arising from third parties and the supply chain

Fewer than half of all respondents — 30% to 46% — say they’ve responded to the escalating threats that complex business ecosystems pose. The ones that have responded seem to be focusing their efforts primarily on today, perhaps at the expense of tomorrow. Asked how they’re minimising their third-party risks, they gave largely reactionary answers: auditing or verifying their suppliers’ compliance (46%), sharing information with third parties or helping them in some other way to improve their cyber stance (42%), and addressing cost- or time-related challenges to cyber resilience (40%). Only one top response — that they are refining criteria for onboarding and ongoing assessments (42%) — could be considered proactive, offering benefits over the long term. Publicly listed organisations (47%) were significantly more likely to claim this step. Still, more than half have taken no actions that promise a more lasting impact on their third-party risk management. They’ve not refined their third-party criteria (58%), not rewritten contracts (60%), not increased the rigor of their due diligence (62%). Meanwhile, the “most improved” are five times more likely to have taken all seven actions listed.


### Simplifying the Chain

Dependence on third parties continues to rise. The “transaction” costs within the enterprise of establishing multiple nodes of partnerships (where risks are hidden) have gone down, thanks to the ubiquity and lower cost of digital interactions via APIs. Today’s trending cyber-attack target may be the most nefarious one yet: your supply chain of trusted vendors, suppliers and contractors. The weapon? A process many have taken completely for granted: the software update. The payoff? Ransom payments to cybercriminals, valuable intelligence to nation-states or training data sets for AI models to competitors. Over the past decade, vendors and hijacked updates accounted for 60% of software supply chain attacks and disclosures, according to The Atlantic Council. The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) predicted in a July 21, 2021 report that supply chain attacks would quadruple in 2021 over the number of 2020 attacks. An organisation could be vulnerable to a supply chain attack even when its own cyber defences are good, with attackers simply finding new pathways into the organisation through its suppliers. Detecting and stopping a software-based attack can be very difficult, and complex to unravel. That’s because every component of any given software depends on other components such as code libraries, packages and modules that integrate into the software and are necessary for its operation.

More than half have taken none of three actions that promise a more lasting impact on their third-party risk management

The organisations that had the best cyber outcomes over the past two years have consolidated tech vendors as a simplification move. Paring the number of tech and other third parties reduces complexity and increases your ability to know how secure they are. One benefit is that different functions (procurement, risk managers, fraud team, legal, security) can better understand their roles in protecting their supply chains from cyber disruptions. And with fewer vendors to monitor, your organisation can more efficiently keep an eye on their security practices. Gaining visibility into the web of third-party relationships and dependencies is a must. Top cybersecurity companies integrate solutions (real-time threat intelligence, threat hunting, security analytics, vulnerability management, intrusion detection and response) on broad platforms. Finally, good habits go together. In our US Digital Trust Insights Survey, respondents with more advanced data trust practices stood out in multiple ways. They significantly reduced their number of third-party relationships, increased their monitoring, deepened their assessments of third parties and felt confident that their third-party risk management program had shown tangible benefits in the last two years — including increased cost savings, faster implementation of business initiatives, greater customer confidence and enhanced market power.


### Public-Private Collaboration

Visibility also means seeing which challenges others face and what they are doing to meet them. Collaborators can be an important part of your cyber-business ecosystem. Just ask the companies and federal agencies that benefited from the public-private partnership and government responses to significant cyber incidents early in 2021. Timely sharing of information matters for cybersecurity in general, critical infrastructure or not. But fewer than one-third of survey respondents said their public-private collaboration efforts are “very effectively” helping them achieve their cyber goals. Those who’ve had the best cybersecurity outcomes over the past two years, however, were 34x more likely to have achieved their public-private collaboration goals “very effectively.” Organisations increasing their cyber budgets in 2022 were significantly likely to say they have achieved these goals “very effectively”:

* Share knowledge about new threats, approaches, and solutions in my peer set (38%)
* Demonstrate avoidance of tangible financial losses (36%)
* Activate public-private sector relationships for more effective responses to a cyber attack on our organisation (33%)
* Promote broader awareness and upskilling of workforce (32%)
