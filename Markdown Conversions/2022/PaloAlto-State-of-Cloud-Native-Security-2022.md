The State of Cloud Native Security Report 2022
Introduction
In these yearly State of Cloud Native Security Reports, more than 3,000 respondents around 
the world are surveyed about their cloud adoption strategies, budgets, experiences, and plans. 
Their responses shed light on the practices, tools, and technologies used to implement cloud 
workloads and manage security for cloud native architectures. As in the 2020 report, we aim to 
highlight the behaviors and correlated outcomes of organizations who succeeded in their cloud 
initiatives, as well as those who fell short. A clear differentiator appeared in how organizations 
addressed cloud security. This includes differences in how they implemented technologies and 
processes to support both high security posture, defined as the effectiveness of their cloud 
­
security efforts, and low security friction, defined as the degree to which cloud security is 
­
limiting their operations. 
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the COVID\-19 pandemic influenced both cloud expansion and ­
results 
(see “The Ongoing Impact of COVID\-19”). While organizations moved quickly during the 
­
pandemic to respond to increased cloud demands, many still struggled to automate cloud 
­
security and mitigate cloud risks. Yet, the move to the cloud continues for companies at all 
stages, from those newly taking advantage of cloud capabilities to the well\-established, born\-
in\-the\-cloud organizations. 
The report identified patterns in approaches and outcomes that led to three ­
representative 
groups known as Moderate Adopters, Rapid Expanders, and Established Users. These groups 
emerged based on traits such as cloud footprint, transformation goals, and operational 
­
strategies. We present these groups along with rigorous data and analysis of their behaviors to 
help readers find their organization’s peer group and identify common challenges and strategies 
that impact outcomes. Regardless of your organization’s cloud maturity level, industry, region, 
or cloud\-migration goals, the research outlined in this report provides the essential insights you 
need to plan your cloud adoption path.

Executive Summary
As the cloud’s unique capabilities continue to evolve, so have the ways in which we employ it 
to drive business forward. As such, this report includes research that pays special attention to 
the latest top\-of\-mind concerns and narratives in the cloud native security community, including 
­
automation, DevSecOps, security posture, the use of open source and more. Our goal each year 
in the production of this report remains the same: for you to come away with valuable insights 
that help guide your cloud adoption and security journey in 2022 and beyond. 
Cloud Expansion and Strategy
• Organizations rapidly expanded their use of clouds during the pandemic by more than 25% 
overall but struggled with ­
comprehensive security, compliance, and technical complexity.
• Organizations expanded with less budget, with 39% of ­
organizations spending less than 
$10M on their cloud (up 16% from 2020\) and only 26% spending more than $50M (down 
17% from 2020\). 
• While organizations continue to use diverse compute options, platform as a service (PaaS) 
and serverless approaches rose 20%, likely supporting the rapid transition to the cloud, 
while the use of containers and containers as a service (CaaS) saw more moderate growth.
Security Posture and Friction
• Organizations with a strong security posture are more than 2X more likely to have low levels 
of security friction—the degree to which organizations believe cloud security supports or limits 
their operations. This highlights the need for a two\-pronged approach to cloud security, with 
effective security capabilities that don’t disrupt teams outside of security. 
• Organizations with best\-in\-class security operations see the greatest benefits to their 
­
workforce in terms of productivity and satisfaction. Eighty percent of those with strong 
­
security posture and 85% of those with low security friction reported increased 
­
workforce productivity.
• A majority of organizations (55%) report a weak security posture and believe they need 
to improve their underlying activities—such as gaining multicloud visibility, applying more 
­
consistent governance across accounts, or streamlining incident response and investigation—
to achieve a stronger posture.
• Eighty percent of organizations that primarily use open source security tools have weak or 
very weak security ­
posture, compared to 26% of those who primarily leverage their cloud 
­
services provider and 52% of those who depend on third parties, highlighting that piecing 
­
together a platform using disparate tools leaves an organization less secure.
Security Drivers
• Organizations are consolidating their security approach. Nearly three\-quarters use 10 or 
fewer security tools, and we see a 27% increase from the 2020 data in the number of 
­
organizations using just one to five security vendors, suggesting that they are looking to 
fewer security vendors for more capabilities.
• Organizations that have implemented a high level of security automation are 2X more likely 
to have low friction and strong posture than their counterparts with low levels of security 
automation.
• How well organizations adopted and implemented ­
DevSecOps methodologies is the 
­
primary indicator of best\-in\-class security. Organizations that tightly integrate DevSecOps 
­
principles are over 7X more likely to have strong or very strong security posture and are 
9X more likely to have low levels of security friction.

The Ongoing Impact of 
COVID\-19
This year’s survey was conducted during 
May 2021—a little over a year after the 
COVID\-19 pandemic sent entire countries 
into shelter\-at\-home restrictions. Our survey 
respondents reported on business decisions 
made over their previous 12 months, from 
June 2020 through June 2021, a period that 
represents the most profound worldwide social and economic upheavals since World War 
II. The decisions these organizations made were in response to dramatic and unexpected 
changes in demand for cloud\-delivered services, which occurred almost simultaneously 
around the globe and impacted every industry segment:
• The rapid shift to remote work, school, and healthcare driving a surge in the use of 
­
online collaboration and meeting tools.
• A sudden, acute demand for business\-critical applications delivered in the cloud.
• A broad consumer shift to low\-contact online shopping and takeout dining.
• Intensified demands for cloud infrastructure support for everything from social services to 
supply chain management.
And as companies raced to meet new and unexpected demands, they found ­
themselves 
facing another kind of global threat: cyberattacks. A Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 Cloud 
Threat Report on COVID noted “an explosion of security incidents” that ­
correlated 
to increased cloud spending by organizations beginning in the first six months of 
the ­
pandemic. The conclusion was that “rapid cloud scale and complexity without 
­
automated security controls embedded across the entire development pipeline are a 
toxic combination.” At the time of writing, the ­
pandemic stretches on. ­
Organizations 
­
continue to move workloads to the cloud while still struggling to automa­
te cloud 
­
security and mitigate cloud risks.
“Rapid cloud scale and 
­
complexity without ­
automated 
security controls embedded 
across the entire development 
pipeline are a toxic combination.”
The Global State of Cloud and Cloud Native Security 
 
In the first section of this report, we review the broad trends in cloud adoption and cloud security 
­
activities as reported by organizations around the world. (See the Methodology and Demographics section 
for more detail on who we surveyed.) 
Cloud Growth Through the Pandemic 
Throughout the pandemic, there were significant expansions of cloud workloads overall, jumping to 
an average of 59% of workloads hosted on the cloud, up from an average of 46% in 2020\. In ­
addition, 
69% of organizations host more than half of their workloads in the cloud, up from just 31% of 
­
respondents in 2020\.

The State of Cloud Native Security Report 2022
When examining the reasons why organizations expanded their cloud capabilities, the growth was fueled 
by strategic business drivers—application modernization, maintaining competitiveness, and controlling 
infrastructure overhead. While the pandemic was surely a contributing factor in this year’s report, these 
reasons remain paramount for why organizations choose to utilize the cloud in general. The flexibility 
and agility that the cloud provides to organizations allow them to keep businesses moving forward at an 
ever\-increasing pace.
Looking ahead, organizations have not significantly changed their expectations for leveraging the cloud 
since last year. On average, organizations expect to host 68% of their workloads in the cloud within two 
years, which is consistent with last year’s expectation of 65%. Despite a faster shift during the pandemic 
than many organizations expected, this suggests that the upper limit of organizations’ cloud transforma­
tion has not significantly grown. 
Cloud composition also evolved this year, as organizations shifted toward private hosting of their 
cloud workloads, with an average of 55% of cloud workloads on private clouds, up seven percentage 
points from 2020\. While organizations continue to use diverse compute options, PaaS and ­
serverless 
­
approaches rose 20 percentage points, while the use of containers and CaaS saw more moderate 
growth. PaaS and serverless strategies, which allow development teams to put applications in the cloud 
without necessarily having to build and scale infrastructure at the same time, likely helped support 
the rapid transition to the cloud seen in the past year. This is a trend we expect to continue and plan to 
closely monitor.

Despite the push to move more workloads to the cloud, organizations did so with less budget than the 
previous year. In 2021, 39% of organizations spent less than $10 million on their cloud, an increase of 
16% from 2020, while only 26% spent more than $50 million, a drop of 17% from 2020\. This drop in 
cloud spending may be the result of across\-the\-board budget cuts or reallocation of funds due to the 
pandemic, or it may simply reflect a “normalization” of cloud activities, with budgets falling naturally 
as teams gain confidence and efficiencies with experience.

Figure 4: Changes to cloud budgets
While we see slight differences in cloud adoption approaches by industry, geography, and revenue, the 
data indicates that these variations do not play a significant role in overall results. That said, the figure 
below highlights some of the more notable regional variations.
In Brazil, almost half (48%) of respondents 
expect their companies to have anywhere 
from 76\-100% of their workloads in the 
cloud in the next two years, showing a 
movement of embracing the cloud. 
The UK uses more open source tooling as 
their primary provider for cloud security 
than any other country surveyed.
Almost half (47%) of USA respondents 
report a strong or very strong security 
posture, higher in comparison to other 
countries. 
Germany reported the highest percentage 
of automating security processes (40%). 
Japan reported the most significant 
increase of using Serverless architecture 
(57%) in the next 24 months, over any 
other architecture.

Security Challenges in Moving to the Cloud
As organizations rapidly expanded their use of the cloud over the past year, they reported the same 
top challenges as last year’s respondents: comprehensive security and compliance, along with 
­
technical complexity.

Figure 6: Challenges in moving to the cloud
While top\-line cloud budgets fell, cloud security budgets remained steady. 
We interpret that to mean that while organizations spent less money on the 
cloud overall, they did not let their security budgets waver. This highlights 
that companies understand the value of securing the cloud in order to take 
the most advantage of it.
We saw this year that companies expanded their cloud security teams during 
the pandemic, with 53% of organizations reporting a security team of over 
30 people, up from 41% last year. Companies also consolidated their cloud 
security vendors as they expanded their cloud environments. The data shows 
a 27% increase in the number of organizations using just one to five security 
vendors, while those using six to ten vendors is down 19% since last year.

The State of Cloud Native Security Report 2022
While companies reduced the number of security vendors they engage, they made minimal year\-over\-
year changes in the number of security tools they are leveraging. We define cloud security vendors as any 
company that organizations employ to secure their clouds and security tools as the number of ­
capabilities 
and/or features those cybersecurity companies offer. Nearly three\-quarters of organizations use 10 or 
fewer security tools, suggesting that they are looking to fewer security vendors to satisfy the need for a 
wide range of capabilities. This consolidation supports observations that organizations who depend on 
disparate tools from multiple vendors can experience blind spots that increase risk and force additional 
efforts to close those gaps. For the 28% of organizations who are still using large numbers of tools—­
including the 8% using 21 to more than 50 tools—we raise a cautionary flag. 
Of those organizations that used 21 or more security tools, almost all (91%) used six or more ven­
dors to supply them. To manage so many tools simultaneously, these organizations had larger teams 
managing and supporting cloud workload security; nearly half (49%) of them employed more than 50 
employees to manage cloud security. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, higher tool usage is more likely to 
be taken on by companies with higher revenues. Of respondents working at companies with revenues 
of $1 billion, 11% indicated using 21 or more tools, versus only 3% of those working for companies with 
revenues less than $1 billion.
Organizational Attributes of High Performance
Beyond the varying use of security vendors and tools, we also examined the organizational security 
attributes that underlie successful cloud expansion. The research highlights the key elements of cloud 
native security, drivers for best\-in\-class security, and the impact of security on wider organizational 
success. 
To reach a conclusion that allowed us to compare otherwise disparate organizations, we studied two 
opposing security attributes:
• Security posture is how organizations rate the effectiveness of their cloud security efforts. 
• Security friction is the degree to which organizations believe cloud security supports or limits their 
operations.
To measure cloud security posture, we asked respondents about their agreement with six statements. 
The more strongly a respondent agreed with the statements, the stronger the overall perception of the 
organization’s cloud security posture. We found that a slight majority of organizations (55%) have a 
weak security posture. More specifically, this majority believes their underlying activities—such as 
gaining multicloud visibility, applying more consistent governance across accounts, or streamlining 
incident response and investigation—need to be more effective.
Security Posture and Spending
Organizations with strong security postures tend to spend more on security. Over two\-thirds of those 
with strong or very strong security posture invested 16% or more of their cloud budget on security. For 
those with weak or very weak security posture, under a fifth spent the same percentage of their cloud 
budget on security. The “strong security posture” group also appears to have plans to increase its secu­
rity spending. Nearly three\-quarters (71%) of organizations with strong or very strong security posture 
plan to spend 16% or more of their cloud budget on security over the next 12 months, versus only 46% 
of the weak or very weak security posture group.

By combining these two metrics, we see that achieving low 
security friction is essential to driving a stronger ­
security 
­
posture. Organizations with a strong security posture 
are more than two times more likely to have low levels of 
­
security friction. This highlights the need to take a two\-
pronged approach to cloud security: organizations should 
strive for the most effective security capabilities, but they 
need to ­
ensure those tools and processes do not interfere with 
the flow of business operations.
Beyond operational excellence, we also see ­
additional 
­
advantages to achieving these best\-in\-class security 
­
outcomes. Organizations that enable high security posture and low friction see the greatest benefits to 
their workforce in terms of increased productivity and higher employee satisfaction with over 80% of 
organizations with low levels of security friction reporting increased or significantly increased levels 
of employee satisfaction.
To analyze cloud security friction, we asked respondents whether they agree with two statements about 
business outcomes as a result of cloud adoption and security. The more strongly a respondent agreed with 
the statements, the higher the respondent’s overall perception of their company’s cloud security friction. 
Here we find that just under half (48%) of organizations believe they have low security friction.

How Organizations Achieve Stronger Security Posture
Next, we examine the approaches taken by top\-performing organizations to reduce organizational 
friction and improve overall posture. The organizations that achieve this balanced, best\-in\-class security 
excel in two related disciplines:
• DevSecOps integration—the degree to which cloud security touchpoints have been integrated into the 
full development lifecycle, from build to runtime.
• Cloud security automation—the degree to which cloud security has been automated.
We asked respondents to rate the degree of their organization’s DevSecOps integration on a scale of 
“never” to “always” in response to four questions.

Requirements and design phase of
the delivery cycle

How well organizations adopted and implemented 
DevSecOps methodologies was the primary ­
indicator 
of best\-in\-class security. Organizations that tightly 
integrate DevSecOps principles into their ­
development 
lifecycle are over seven times more likely to have strong 
or very strong security posture and are nine times more 
likely to have low levels of security friction.
To measure automation, we asked respondents to 
rate how deeply their organization has automated five 
­
security practices, on a scale of “completely manual” to 
“completely automated.”

We find that organizations that have implemented a high level of security automation are roughly two 
times more likely to have low friction and strong posture than their counterparts with low levels of 
security automation. Specifically, pushing past “average” levels of automation leads to a significant 
increase in security outcomes.
The Impact of Open Source Security Tools
Organizations took a wide variety of approaches to the providers of their security tools, leveraging 
cloud service providers (CSPs), third parties, and open source security tools. However, the data reveals 
consistent challenges for organizations that rely primarily on open source tools. 
This group tends to have smaller budgets than their counterparts who are leveraging third\-party or 
CSP methods, but perhaps counter\-intuitively, these teams are larger than those using tools from 
third\-party or CSP providers, with 70% of organizations that rely primarily on open source tools 
­
reporting security teams of 30 or more.

Figure 18: Security provider and security posture
In aggregate, the data suggests that open source security tools do not offer an integrated, compre­
hensive approach that satisfies the full range of capabilities and features organizations are looking 
for. ­
Organizations successfully utilizing open source security tools seem to merely shift budget costs 
to ­
labor in order to support their efforts. Organizations that are looking to adopt open source tools 
should be prepared to trade a highly customized implementation with ongoing investments for internal 
­
support that would otherwise come from designated solution providers. 
Identify and Learn from Your Cloud Group
To determine if certain frameworks can drive best\-in\-class security outside of DevSecOps methodologies 
and automated security, as noted above, we looked for patterns in the paths that organizations took to 
­
develop their cloud environments and cloud security during the pandemic. This period provided some­
thing of a natural experiment, where we were able to compare different approaches and see their impact 
on a significantly condensed timeline. Rather than waiting for several years, this concentrated move to 
the cloud produced rapid results in just months. 
From the data, we discovered three representative groups based on ­
organizational 
behaviors and approaches to cloud security. Note that our findings from these 
groups remain consistent regardless of geography, industry, or revenue. This 
gives us a unique look at cloud success factors—and paths to failure—based on 
how organizations approach their cloud and cloud security initiatives rather than 
who they are.
The first group is the Moderate Adopters, comprising organizations with a lower 
focus on cloud adoption both before and during the pandemic. The second group is 
Rapid Expanders, made up of organizations that had small cloud footprints before 
the pandemic but engaged in rapid, widespread cloud adoption during the pandemic. 
Finally, Established Users are organizations that already had large cloud footprints 
before the pandemic and continued moderate expansion during this time.
We encourage you to explore the traits and experiences of each group to identify which most closely 
matches your organization. You can use the data to benchmark your organization against your peers, 
validate experiences, and explore differences. This analysis also allows you to identify a group that most 
closely matches your future cloud aspirations and explore the decisions and behaviors the group exhibits 
to inform your ongoing strategies for long\-term success.

Cloud Footprints
Moderate Adopters came into the pandemic with a fairly small cloud footprint and expanded minimally 
over the following 12 months. Rapid Expanders entered the pandemic with a similar small cloud estate 
but with much faster expansion. In contrast, Established Users show a significant existing cloud foot­
print but with slower growth, similar to the Moderate Adopters. 
Future Cloud Plans 
When asked about future plans, both groups with small, pre\-pandemic footprints—Moderate Adopters 
and Rapid Expanders—expect to have 62% of workloads moving to the cloud over the next two years. 
In contrast, Established Users expect to continue their heavy adoption, putting an average of 84% of 
workloads in the cloud in the next two years.

Cloud Spending
Across all groups, cloud spend varied significantly. Only 42% of Moderate Adopters spent more than 
$10M on the cloud, compared to 69% of Rapid Expanders and 70% of Established Users. Established 
Users also have the highest cloud budgets, with 10% spending over $100M, compared to just 2% of

Approach to Compute Environment
We also see differences in approaches to cloud architectures. Established Users are far more likely to 
use a blend of compute environments, including virtual machines (VMs), containers/CaaS, PaaS, and 
serverless, with 65% of this group using all four equally. Rapid Expanders also show a mostly balanced 
approach (48%), but with twice the use of PaaS compared to Established Users (28% versus 14%). This 
decision to avoid infrastructure management may have enabled some of Rapid Expanders’ fast growth. 
Our analysis is that Moderate Adopters, with smaller cloud footprints and slower growth plans, may not 
be “cloud\-first” organizations; rather, their cloud efforts are designed to support other ­
organizational 
strategies. This group’s compute decisions (47% primarily use serverless, and 32% have a balanced 
stack) may reflect this, with an approach that favors lower overhead and is focused on the development 
of application code rather than building and maintaining cloud infrastructure.

Rapid Cloud Expansion Has 
Polarizing Results
As we investigated the cloud goals of our groups deeper, we 
uncovered a surprising pattern. The Rapid Expander group 
split into two distinct sub\-groups. The majority of Rapid 
Expanders (74%) raced to successfully increase their cloud 
footprint, moving 35% of workloads to the cloud in the past 
year and planning to move another 12% of workloads over the 
next two years. 
In contrast, the other 26% of Rapid Expanders moved 28% 
of workloads to the cloud during the pandemic, but strikingly, 
they plan to decrease cloud workloads by 26% in the next two 
years, which suggests that they plan to either move workloads 
out of the cloud or not add any net new workloads to the cloud.
This divide in the rapid\-growth group prompted new ques­
tions: What caused such a dramatic split? What can we learn 
from these organizations’ experiences? How can we apply that 
learning to successful future cloud initiatives?

We also see significant differences in our groups’ cloud objectives. For all groups, short\-term goals 
such as application modernization and maintaining competitiveness were the primary drivers of cloud 
expansion, while more strategic thinking took a back seat. However, there were large differences in 
organizational alignment, where our successful Rapid Expanders were significantly more likely to 
­
integrate their cloud evolution into a larger strategic digital transformation effort. Rapid Expanders 
who successfully expanded their cloud infrastructure over the past year were over two times more 
likely to have integrated it into a wider, strategic digital transformation effort.

Figure 25: Spending levels by adoption group
As we dig deeper, this split can be explained by Rapid Expanders, who were successful in their cloud 
adoption efforts—and those who experienced noteworthy challenges. The Rapid Expanders with 
challenging adoptions made significantly higher investments in the cloud than their more successful 
peers, with 45% spending more than $50 million on the cloud in 2021, compared to only 13% of Rapid 
Expanders that are continuing on their trajectory. This suggests that some Rapid Expanders may have 
tried to spend their way out of trouble rather than addressing underlying root issues.

Additionally, comprehensive security and addressing regulatory compliance were some of the top 
challenges across all groups, but a critical pattern emerged: Rapid Expanders cited comprehensive 
security as a top challenge more frequently than other groups. They were also significantly more likely 
to call out challenges with strategy, budget, and talent. This supports the notion that successful cloud 
adoption must be part of wider strategic organizational transformations—because the cloud will 
affect many areas of the business and the wider business must be prepared to support those changes. 
While the retreating group of Rapid Expanders represents only 8% of all the organizations studied, they 
highlight the challenges of integrating security into cloud adoption efforts.

The Role of Security Vendors, Teams, and Tools
The two Rapid Expander groups took two distinct approaches to partner with security vendors—83% of 
those who were successful used five or fewer vendors. At the same time, only 45% of Rapid Expanders 
who experienced challenging cloud adoption did the same.

Next, as we look at security teams, successful Rapid Expanders tend to have a relatively smaller team 
along with a smaller vendor network but more security tools (again, security tools are defined as 
the number of capabilities and/or features cybersecurity companies offer). On the other hand, Rapid 
Expanders who experienced challenges tended to use larger teams, larger vendor networks, and fewer 
security tools.

Figure 29: Size of cloud security teams
The research shows high numbers of security tools being used across all groups, with more than half 
of each using more than five tools. This suggests that there may be a variable equation for the optimal 
number of security tools needed for a given environment, where larger cloud environments necessarily 
require more tools or different teams prefer different tool sets. But an over\-emphasis on simplicity may 
be detrimental, where unsuccessful adoptions seem to be driven by a lack of security information and 
controls due to lack of availability from tooling.

If such a variable equation exists, the data indicates that the integration of security 
tools is also a critical factor. Companies that leverage fewer than five security tools 
struggle to deliver a strong or very strong security posture—but friction among 
teams is unaffected by the number of tools. Rather, it's the ability to integrate 
your security tools through DevSecOps methodologies—thereby gaining broader 
visibility and comprehensive control—that results in better outcomes. This aligns 
with industry trends toward consolidated, comprehensive security platforms.

Group Adoption of Best\-in\-Class Security
Earlier in the report, we discussed the importance of DevSecOps integration and security automation as 
critical elements for best\-in\-class cloud security. Our groups illustrate 63% of Rapid Expanders who 
successfully expanded their cloud adoption also integrated DevSecOps principles. This is considerably 
higher even when compared to Established Users, which suggests that successful Rapid Expanders paid 
special attention to integrating security throughout the entire development lifecycle as they scaled up 
cloud capabilities.

Similarly, groups who are heavily leveraging the cloud—Established Users and successful Rapid

Expanders—are also leaning into automation, with high levels of automation present for 44% and

of Rapid Expanders who struggled showed a weak or very weak security posture. Moderate ­
Adopters 
exhibit a low security posture as well, but as noted earlier, this group, which remains dedicated to

lighter cloud usage, may measure cloud success or failure differently.

Here we see more signs that organizational alignment is critical for successful cloud transformations—
groups who struggle with their posture also struggle with security friction. Half of the struggling Rapid 
Expanders have high security friction, compared to only 13% of successful Rapid Expanders and 14% 
of Established Users.
23
The State of Cloud Native Security Report 2022
The divide between Rapid Expanders allowed us to explore what makes a successful rapid expansion to 
the cloud. In summary, we have learned the following:
• High cloud spend does not equate to successful cloud adoption.
• Integrating cloud adoption into a wider strategic digital transformation effort is key to success.
• Consolidation of security vendors who offer a plethora of security tools leads to successful cloud 
­
adoption efforts.
• Larger security teams do not equate to a more secure organization.
• DevSecOps integration and security automation are necessary components to achieving successful 
cloud adoption.
• CSP\- or third\-party\-driven security providers offer the highest chance of successful and secure cloud 
adoption.
Final Thoughts
The pandemic put a distinctive mark on this year’s State of Cloud Native Security Report, and we expect 
to see its impact continue. Despite rapid changes in business strategies and resources, however, organi­
zations have mostly been able to succeed in their cloud expansions during this time of upheaval. Even 
with today’s complex, heterogeneous cloud environments—which incorporate a mix of public and 
private clouds, diverse compute compositions, and a growing number of cloud service providers—our 
research indicates a proven path forward. 
Overall, organizations that made cloud infrastructure a strategic focus across the business were more 
successful. Further, cloud security is a clear enabler of business outcomes. For any type of organi­
zation, anywhere in the world, security best practices are consistent and can be implemented as key 
drivers for cloud success. Of course, better security does not necessarily lead to a specific measurement. 
But having security under control—consolidating tools and vendors as well as using proven DevSecOps 
and ­
security automation strategies—sets a baseline that lets development teams do their jobs better 
and enables organizations to succeed in their cloud transformations.
Methodology and Demographics
This survey was administered online, and data was gathered from May 3 to June 1, 2021\. Respondents 
were surveyed from across the globe, spanning the US, Germany, the UK, Brazil, and Japan. This pop­
ulation also included all major industries, with significant representation from consumer products 
and services, energy resources and industrials, financial services, technology media and telecommu­
nication, and life services and healthcare. Over two\-thirds are from enterprise\-sized organizations 
(over $1B in annual revenue), and respondents were gathered from both ends of the organizational 
spectrum—the sample split between executive leadership and more practitioner\-level roles in order 
to understand sentiments broadly across companies. Practitioner\-level respondents were restricted to 
those who work in development, IT or information security functions. Respondents were sourced from 
professional survey panels, and all respondents reported themselves knowledgeable and familiar with 
their organization’s cloud operations and cloud security.
