The State 
of Security 
2022

New global research conducted by Splunk and the Enterprise 
Strategy Group of more than 1,200 security leaders found that 49% 
of organizations say they’d suffered a data breach over the past two 
years, up from 39% in our survey a year earlier. And while certain attack 
vectors dominated headlines in the last year or two, criminals are still 
finding success with traditional playbooks:
 
■51% report business email compromise, up from 42% a year ago. 
 
■39% of organizations report insider attacks, up from 27% a year ago. 
 
■79% say they’ve encountered ransomware attacks, and 35% admit one 
or more of those attacks led them to lose access to data and systems. 
Additionally, 40% of respondents report a regulatory violation (up from 
28% a year ago). More and more sophisticated attacks, acute talent 
shortages and pandemic-specific challenges have SOCs reeling.

## The Heat Is (Still) On
The state of security in 2022 is highly adrenalized — more so 
than usual. Two years into the deadly and disruptive global 
pandemic, not only are we continuing to see more attacks, 
we’re also seeing more actual breaches.

### The Heat Is (Still) On
It’s not clear whether these numbers are a sobering 
indication that attackers are significantly more 
successful today or if, as Splunk Distinguished 
Security Strategist Ryan Kovar notes, it’s a question 
of causation versus correlation. Are intruders better 
at penetrating our defenses, or are security teams 
better at detecting intruders? The answer is probably 
“both,” with offense and defense each improving 
aspects of their game. 
“And ransomware skewers this because they actively 
tell you that you’re compromised,” Kovar says, “while 
traditional attackers try to get in and out without 
being detected.”
Regardless of why security teams are detecting more 
breaches, they’re having to work a lot harder, and are 
feeling greater effects than ever before.
All told, 59% of security teams say they had to devote 
significant time and resources for remediation 
(up from 42% a year ago). Forty-four percent say 
they’ve suffered disruption of business processes 
(versus 35% a year ago), and 44% say they’ve lost 
confidential data (up from 28% a year ago).

### The Heat Is (Still) On
The costs of these incidents are not theoretical, and they matter 
to more than the security budget. In addition to lost business, 
ransoms and reputation loss, downtime is hugely expensive 
for the entire organization. The majority of respondents (54%) 
report that business-critical applications suffer unplanned 
downtime due to a cybersecurity incident on at least a monthly 
basis, with a median of 12 outages per year. 
Moreover, the median time to recover for business-critical 
workloads suffering from unplanned downtime tied to a 
cybersecurity incident is 14 hours. We asked respondents to 
estimate the hourly cost of downtime for business-critical apps, 
which across the survey sample averaged about $200,000. 
That told us that the average annual cost of downtime tied 
to cybersecurity attacks for organizations today is about 
$33.6 million.
In short, the eternal battle between attackers and defenders 
has been made worse by rising complexity. Intricately woven 
hybrid, multicloud environments host modern cloud-native, 
microservices-based applications alongside legacy technologies, 
and now everyone needs to be able to access it all from their 
spare bedroom.
Security teams must gain complete understanding of, and 
visibility into, their cloud infrastructures to focus on cloud 
hygiene. They face new challenges around secure configuration, 
software vulnerabilities, compliance, and the need to maintain 
an audit trail of access and activity for all of it. At the same time, 
they need to revisit org-specific threat models based on novel 
attack chains.
Let’s see how that’s going.

### The Heat Is (Still) On
Security teams are falling 
behind
Fully 64% of respondents say keeping up with security requirements has 
gotten harder in recent years, up from 49% a year ago. Top reasons include:
 
■The dangerous threat landscape (say 38% of respondents; 
down from 48% but still ranked first).
 
■An overwhelmingly complex security stack (30%, up from  
25% and fifth place a year ago).
 
■Skilled labor recruitment and retention issues (both 29%,  
both up slightly from last year).
Top challenges for security teams include:
 
■Over-rotating to focus on compliance over best practices  
(29%, up from 23% and the fourth most cited response 
last year).
 
■Spending too much time addressing emergencies (28%,  
up from 26% and the second most frequently cited response  
a year ago).
 
■Struggling to manage the complexity of security technologies 
(26%, up from 24% and maintaining its position as the third 
most cited challenge).
 
■Dealing with the challenges of being understaffed (26%,  
up from 22% a year ago and the fifth most cited challenge).
All told, the necessary attention to compliance, too much time on reactive 
footing, and the challenges of too much complexity and too few people 
conspire to distract the SOC from focusing on emerging threats.

### The Heat Is (Still) On
Remote workers remain 
a challenge
The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 created 
unprecedented challenges for security experts and, as we noted 
in last year’s report, new levels of collaboration and cooperation 
among security, IT and business teams. Two years later, many 
of the challenges remain vexing, perhaps none more than 
remote work. 
Organizations are still supporting, on average, double the 
number of remote workers compared to pre-pandemic norms. 
While today’s average, 46% of workforces, is 10 points lower 
than in 2021, there’s no return to pre-pandemic levels in sight. 
Organizations expect that 12 months out, 41% of their workers 
will remain remote. As a result, 90% see a need to adjust security 
controls and policies.
This shift to more remote work has resulted in operational 
challenges, including ensuring access to the corporate network 
(noted by 29% of respondents), making sure devices in use 
are securely configured (28%) and securing access to cloud 
assets (27%).

### The Heat Is (Still) On
While remote work and other pandemic measures have been stressful 
for IT organizations and business units, security teams have been 
particularly hard hit: 80% say that the SOC has to continually create and 
implement new threat detection rules to accommodate remote workers.
Additionally, 65% of organizations have seen a measurable increase in 
attempted cyberattacks, which is particularly problematic since 78% 
say remote workers are harder to secure.
As noted above regarding successful breaches, these rising numbers 
aren’t necessarily caused only by proliferating attacks. Organizations 
may also be getting better at detecting attacks.
Still, respondents attributed the rise in attacks at least in part to the 
greater attack surface that widespread remote work presents.

### The Heat Is (Still) On
Supply chain worries 
are front and center
There has been a lot of buzz around the concept of supply chain 
attacks since the discovery, in late 2020, of the SolarWinds 
hacks, followed by the Kaseya attack, Log4Shell and others. Our 
State of Security survey in 2021 was conducted two months 
after the SolarWinds disclosure, and at that time, only 47% of 
CISOs had briefed boards or the C-suite on supply chain risks. 
A year later, the continued buzz has inspired strategic action. 
Ninety percent of organizations — nearly everyone — reported 
that they have increased their focus on third-party risk 
assessment as a result of those high-profile attacks. In fact, 61% 
of CISOs are now regularly briefing their boards and/or line of 
business executives about activity in this space (up from 47% 
a year ago, just two months after SolarWinds).
New attention to this attack vector has led 97% of organizations 
in our survey to have taken some kind of action. Most often (33%, 
up two points year-over-year), respondents have increased their 
cybersecurity budget. Also of importance is the CISO’s ability to 
engage business leaders and the board of directors. Fifty-four 
percent of respondents say that such discussions accelerated 
actions, and another 38% say these actions wouldn’t have taken 
place otherwise.
“All of this is a huge change,” Kovar says. “In my 20 years in IT 
security, I’ve never seen software supply chain threats reach  
this level of visibility.”
The change may not be entirely a hype response. Forty percent 
of survey respondents said that their organization had been 
affected by a supply chain attack. Kovar says that supply chain 
attacks will soon change how software is bought and sold.
“We’re likely to see buyers require an SBOM, a software bill of 
materials,” he says. “It will list the elements within a complex 
software package, so that when a supply chain attack 
is discovered, you can quickly know if your organization 
is vulnerable.”

### The Heat Is (Still) On
Ransomware:  
Playbooks and payoffs
If there’s something driving more concern in 2022 than supply 
chain attacks, it’s probably ransomware (which, as in the Kaseya 
and Log4Shell cases, can come through the supply chain). Last 
June, in the wake of its executive order on cybersecurity, the 
Biden Administration issued a memo specifically on ransomware. 
Beyond concern, organizations are taking action: 84% of 
organizations surveyed have developed a formal ransomware 
playbook — a list of required steps for responding to a 
ransomware attack. But to date it’s been a reactive response; 
of organizations that suffered a successful ransomware 
attack, 71% only developed a playbook after they had been 
successfully attacked.
The top response to ransomware: Pay up. Among respondents 
who fell victim to a successful ransomware attack, only 33% 
avoided the ransom by restoring from backup. About 66% 
reported that the criminals were paid, either by the organization 
(in 39% of cases) or their insurance company (27%). Asked how 
much the largest ransom paid to attackers was, the average 
response was about US$347,000.
It’s worth noting that those who have not been successfully 
hijacked have more swagger. Among respondents who had not 
fallen victim, only 42% reported that their organization is likely to 
pay off the attackers.
“That may be a case of overconfidence in remediation plans,” 
Kovar says. “Once their disaster recovery or backup capability is 
put to the test, many orgs might discover that it’s not as easy as 
they thought.”
Apart from better response planning, security leaders are 
putting their faith in data: 88% agreed that better capture and 
analysis of detection data is one of their most effective tools for 
preventing successful ransomware attacks.

### The Heat Is (Still) On
Security teams reel from 
talent crisis
Security talent is always scarce. But this year, security leaders are 
facing an especially daunting labor shortage.
Fully 87% of respondents report skills or staffing challenges; 53% 
say they can’t hire enough staff and 58% cite an inability to find 
talent with the right skills. Again, a perennial issue, but these trends 
are heading in the wrong direction: 85% say it has gotten harder to 
recruit and retain talent over the past 12 months — during which the 
so-called “Great Resignation” played out across industries.
The ongoing talent challenges have led to a number of issues:
 
■70% say that the resulting increase in their workload  
has led them to consider looking for a new role.
 
■76% say team members have been forced to take on 
responsibilities they aren’t ready for.
 
■68% report that talent shortages directly led to the 
failure of one or more projects/initiatives.
 
■73% say that workers have resigned, citing burnout.
That last stat is especially troubling. If resignations lead to more 
resignations, the talent crisis becomes self-perpetuating.

### The Heat Is (Still) On
## The State of Cloud: 
Business-Critical Baseline
Across the board, the still-growing role of cloud 
computing has become essential to organizations. 
About 73% use multiple public clouds today, and when 
compared to a year ago, we see multicloud realities have 
continued to expand: 34% use three or more public cloud 
service providers (up from 29% a year ago). The trend will 
continue: 56% expect they will use three or more public 
cloud service providers (IaaS and PaaS) 24 months 
from now.
And those secondary clouds aren’t secondary. Sixty-five 
percent of multicloud users report meaningful utilization 
across clouds; only 35% say that their secondary clouds 
are minor/niche.
Cloud-hosted applications are now performing business-
critical functions across lines of business; 66% of 
respondents say the majority of their business-critical 
apps are cloud-hosted, up from 41% a year ago.

### The Heat Is (Still) On
Cloud hampers security 
visibility
Though the migration to cloud has been a steady story for years,  
it greatly accelerated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Security teams find the 
resulting complexity daunting. The growing criticality of cloud puts pressure 
on security leaders to understand the cloud. More than three-quarters 
of respondents (79%) say their CISO is under pressure to demonstrate 
increased cloud fluency.
Two cloud-native security challenges continue to stand out: 
 
■Maintaining consistency across data centers and cloud (45%, 
down from 50% but still the top cloud security challenge)
 
■Use of multiple security controls leads to cost and 
complexity (37%, down from 42% but still the No. 2 response)
It would seem that one problem begets the other: More point tools create 
more silos and potential blind spots, which may spur the adoption of more 
narrowly focused tools.
In terms of cloud security visibility areas in need of improvement, the top two 
responses (see chart below) were also leaders last year. A notable change is 
that the No. 3 response, maintaining a clear audit trail of account activity, rose 
from the fifth most common spot last year to No. 3 in 2022.
As with talent shortages leading to burnout leading to attrition, cloud 
complexity has a self-perpetuating aspect: The complexity of infrastructure 
elements leads to a crazy quilt of multiple point tools. The resulting silos 
further hamper visibility and exacerbate operational cost challenges.
“Security teams generally seem to just be figuring out the scope of their cloud 
challenges,” says Ryan Kovar. “Three years ago, I was hearing, ‘Wait, I have to 
monitor the cloud?’ Now it’s, ‘Of course I have to monitor the cloud. But how?’ 
That’s what I think of in terms of increasing organizations’ cloud fluency.”

Having taken measure of the multifarious 
challenges of modern IT security, we turn our 
attention to solutions, to the technologies 
and techniques that organizations worldwide 
are using to keep up with — and maybe get 
ahead of — the bad guys.

## Responding to 
Rising Challenges
The State of Security 2022   |   Splunk

### Responding to Rising Challenges
Talent solutions
Asked to pick strategies that will overcome the talent crisis, our 
respondents picked a combination of tools and training.
 
■58% selected “increase funding for training” from  
a list of options.
 
■52% picked “increase use of cybersecurity tools 
with AI/ML.” 
Additional strategies included:
 
■Better capture and analysis of security data: 47%
 
■Simplifying security tool portfolio (vendor rationalization 
or platform-based controls): 45%
 
■Increasing use of MSSPs/outsourcers: 41%
 
■Increasing investment in commercial security  
controls: 41%
Of course, those two strategies are not mutually exclusive, and 
pretty much everyone is embracing automated tools powered by 
AI/ML: 80% agree that at some point in the next three years, the 
majority of security operations center activities (e.g., threat detection, 
investigation and response) at their organizations will be automated 
with little human oversight.
That’s not to say that you can automate your way out of a talent 
crunch, and many organizations are trying new approaches. One of the 
more difficult cybersecurity roles to find are cloud security architects 
and cloud security engineers. The Venn diagram of cybersecurity skills 
and cloud computing knowledge just doesn’t have enough overlap. In 
response, many organizations are asking their developers to codify 
security processes so that they are reusable and repeatable across 
project teams.
“Automation can help, if you’re careful that you’re not just giving people 
more tools to monitor,” says Splunk Distinguished Security Strategist 
Ryan Kovar. “And on the recruitment front, we have to start considering 
alternative talent pools because there will never be enough security 
talent as it’s traditionally defined.”
For more on both those strategies, see Key Recommendations, below.

The talent shortage,  
in brief:
 
■30% of security leaders say they can’t 
hire enough staff to handle the workload.
 
■35% say they can’t find staff with the 
right skills.
 
■23% say both factors are a problem.
 
■A lucky 13% say they suffer neither 
challenge.

### Responding to Rising Challenges
Organizations’ strong investment in analytics, automation 
and SOAR (security orchestration, automation and response) 
technologies continues:
 
■67% of organizations are actively investing in 
technologies designed for security analytics and 
operations automation and orchestration.
 
■Of those, 35% report that their organization uses 
or will use the automation and orchestration 
capabilities built into their security information and 
event management (SIEM).
The embrace of automation and analytics tools correlates with 
DevSecOps trends (more below); 35% of respondents report 
that their organization has built or will build security rules using 
DevOps tools for automation and orchestration (the most 
frequently cited approach). 

Analytics and automation 
are increasingly essential
Analytics and automation capabilities let security analysts work 
smarter and respond to threats at machine speed. Eighty-two percent 
of respondents say their CISO is under pressure to increase their 
data analysis capabilities. Fully 85% (up from 82% last year) say that 
security analytics plays a bigger role in their overall cybersecurity 
strategy and decision-making today than it did two years ago. 
77% of organizations have integrated non-security 
analytics solutions (for business, IT operations,  
risk management) with cybersecurity-specific 
analytics to support decision-making.

The State of Security 2022   |   Splunk

### Responding to Rising Challenges
The top priorities for incident response automation were to:
 
■Integrate security tools with IT operations systems: 29%
 
■Improve security/ITOps collaboration: 28%
 
■Provide capabilities for “hunting” activities: 28%
 
■Automate basic remediation tasks: 26%
 
■Integrate external threat intel with internal security  
data analysis: 26%
 
■Collect and centralize data from various security  
tools: 24%
Analytics and automation technologies are not only more 
prevalent in SOCs worldwide, they’re increasingly sophisticated. 
Now 63% of organizations (up from 54% a year ago) have 
deployed machine learning technologies for security analytics. 
Most often organizations look to ML-based technologies to 
improve threat detection (37%), get more scale from junior 
analysts (31%) and to automate remediation (30%).

### Responding to Rising Challenges
 
■Applying runtime API security controls (61%)
 
■Logging code changes for audit (59%)
Though the general DevSecOps principle of baking security into the 
beginning of the development process, rather than as a late-stage 
gating factor, is well understood, we asked respondents why they’ve 
adopted the DevSecOps approach. The leading drivers:
1.	 To allow cybersecurity to keep pace with fast-moving 
development teams (46%)
2.	 To establish a more proactive security posture (43%)
3.	 To gain greater operational efficiencies via automation (41%)
4.	 To better secure cloud-resident data (41%)
5.	 To foster collaboration between our cybersecurity, 
development and operations teams (39%)
But does it work? Yes. Seventy percent of DevSecOps adopters report 
an improvement in the cybersecurity team’s ability to keep pace with 
development teams; 70% report a more proactive posture; and 69% 
report an improvement in their ability to secure cloud-hosted data.

The shift toward DevSecOps
DevSecOps has increasing mainstream appeal to help security scale 
alongside pressures to drive faster development and deployment of 
applications. Fully 80% of respondents say their CISOs are under pressure 
to develop their DevSecOps skill sets. (Like DevSecOps adoption, the 
number of things CISOs are under pressure to improve continues to grow.)
For our research, we defined DevSecOps as “a collaborative software 
engineering, operations and cybersecurity practice of incorporating 
the cybersecurity measures and controls at each phase of the 
CI/CD [continuous integration and delivery/deployment] process.” 
Not that we needed to tell them — 75% of organizations say they use 
DevSecOps today.
Roughly three-fifths report that DevSecOps entails automating security 
workflows such as: 
 
■Identifying and remediating software vulnerabilities  
prior to production (62%)
 
■Identifying and remediating malware prior to  
production (64%)

## The Path Forward
While the challenges continue to increase, our 
research shows that organizations are taking smart 
steps to keep up — and maybe even get ahead — 
of the ever-shifting threat landscape.
The State of Security 2022   |   Splunk

### The Path Forward
Pressure is a key theme coming out of this 
2022 research. Criminal and nation-state 
adversaries maintain pressure through attacks 
of increasing volume, variety and sophistication. 
And as business leaders better recognize the 
intensity of the cybersecurity landscape, and 
the existential stakes, they demand more of 
security leaders. Fortunately, there’s also a 
degree of willingness to pay for it.
Nearly every organization we surveyed — 
93% — expect to increase spending on security 
over the next 12-24 months (up from an already 
impressive 88% a year ago). Increasing training 
for cybersecurity and IT operations staff is 
still the leading area of focus (cited by 26% of 
respondents).

## Key Recommendations
There’s more attention on security concerns, from the board of directors 
on down. There’s more pressure on security teams, from the CISO on down. 
And for many organizations, there’s more funding, but does anyone ever 
think it’s enough?
In a world suffering ever-rising threats of ransomware, supply chain attacks 
and staff burnout, to say nothing of the constant threats of insider attacks 
and social engineering — the baseline hurricane, if you will — here is the 
advice that emerges from this global survey.

1. Seek talent, teach skills.
Organizations are already telling us that they’re prioritizing 
efforts to find, train and retain talent. All the traditional efforts in 
that sphere are important, and recommended. But they’re not 
enough. The field of security analysts is just too small to ever 
meet the demand, which is why Ryan Kovar focuses on “talent” 
in its original meaning, not just as a euphemism for “workers.”
“You’re never going to fill the gaps with the traditional security 
workforce,” he says. “We have to consider alternative 
candidate pools.”
That can include people with experience in non-security IT 
roles, but Kovar says he looks even further afield. “We need raw 
talent, not trained skills,” he says. “I’ve had a lot of luck recruiting 
people with journalism, HR and creative backgrounds. I just need 
people with innate curiosity and a talent for synthesizing and 
understanding data.” 
People with a degree in the humanities, he has found, can be 
phenomenal at that — often better than those with traditional 
computer science degrees. 
“I can teach the security analyst role to someone who can 
synthesize data and communicate it more easily than I can  
teach someone who just knows how to code in C++.”

### Key Recommendations
4. Use automation to enhance 
human analysts.
If we’re never going to have enough humans on the team, the 
solution is to just automate everything, right? Kovar warns that 
automation can create as many human headaches as it solves.
“Analysts being overwhelmed, and then burned out, is a difficult 
challenge, and in one sense, automation can make it worse,” he 
says. “The more disparate tools you give someone, the more 
things they have to do, the more they have to keep up with. That 
doesn’t necessarily help with burnout.”
So automate with the intention of liberating your human analysts 
to do their job better. That can mean fewer tools, not more. It can 
mean a platform approach that makes it easier for analysts to 
not only keep up with their tools, but take action on significant 
events, while the basic stuff is remediated at machine speed. 
The result should be less sense of being overwhelmed — and 
less burnout.
“Security people got into the business to solve problems,” Kovar 
says, “not to fill out spreadsheets.”

2. Know your cloud.
Nearly eight in 10 respondents told us that CISOs are under 
pressure to increase their cloud fluency. A significant number 
also expressed confusion over where security responsibilities 
between their teams and their cloud providers connect. Everyone 
from senior security leadership to tier one security analysts 
needs to understand their hybrid, multicloud environment. 
Organizations must dedicate time and training to understand 
the complex interplay of their public, private and SaaS solutions. 
They need the tools and training to securely configure various 
environments, to manage access and authentication, and to 
minimize MTTD and MTTR (mean times to detect and recover).
Many organizations are still in a state of confusion about the 
cloud, and that’s a risk that has to be eliminated through a 
comprehensive approach to skill sets, tool sets, cross-team 
collaboration and education.

3. Build an SBOM.
We mean really know your cloud. And all your software. Every 
software organization should maintain — as in, keep relentlessly 
current — a software bill of materials that lists all software 
components running in production via software composition 
analysis (SCA).
“A lot of organizations don’t do this yet,” Kovar notes. “Thanks to 
the attention to supply chain attacks, customers are going to 
begin demanding SBOMs from their vendors, and it will quickly 
become standard.”

### Key Recommendations
5. Take DevSecOps forward.
To the 23% of respondents who haven’t gotten around to 
DevSecOps yet, we say, “Don’t delay.” To the 2% who aren’t 
even thinking about it, we really urge you to do some reading on 
the topic. For the vast majority who are already making strides: 
Keep going.
Our research found that 75% of organizations are using 
DevSecOps to identify and fix vulnerabilities and to remediate 
malware prior to deployment, as well as logging code changes 
for audit and applying runtime API security controls. Add it 
up, and DevSecOps is helping organizations solve visibility 
challenges (and keep bad software out of production). 
Classic DevSecOps benefits.
The next step, Kovar says, is to apply DevSecOps specifically to 
defending against ransomware and advanced persistent threats. 
“A DevSecOps approach helps you consolidate your network 
defenses to remove inefficiencies,” he says. “It’s an important 
step, because adversaries are increasingly combining attack 
techniques in a way that better exploits our coverage gaps 
or inefficiencies.”
And make sure that your DevSecOps approach covers all 
software development, not just the official engineering team’s 
work. “These days, everyone is developing software,” he says. 
“People don’t necessarily realize that someone in a Fortune 50 
company using Microsoft VBA [Visual Basic for Applications] 
in Excel might be generating more revenue alone than whole 
companies at the bottom of the Fortune 1000.”

6. Consolidate sprawling  
tool sets.
You need the right tool for the right job, as pretty much 
everyone’s grandfather would say. But a piece of software isn’t 
just a tool waiting in a box. It’s an active application that requires 
monitoring to be effective, a degree of care from which we distill 
feedback. In that sense, it’s more like a pet, and there are only so 
many of those you can have running around your house before 
you’re mired in chaos. And poop.
Consolidation is about having the right tools for the right 
jobs, while also making sure that your team can manage the 
responsibility of care. As with haphazard automation, careless 
tool consolidation can increase frustration and burnout. 
Focusing on the necessary set of tools, particularly with a 
platform approach that can gather multiple inputs on one 
dashboard, empowers your analysts with information, rather 
than burdens them with the busywork of checking a million 
outputs. In the long run, organizations save on maintenance, 
training and licensing
