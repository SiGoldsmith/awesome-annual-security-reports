AWS CLOUD 
SECURITY 
REPORT

INTRODUCTION

Cloud environments are increasingly complex, while threats continually evolve. This trend makes 
simplified cybersecurity imperative to meet both operations and compliance requirements. To 
close security gaps, organizations are looking for unified cybersecurity platforms to better manage 
complexity and maintain both visibility and control.

The 2022 AWS Cloud Security Report is based on a comprehensive survey of 578 cybersecurity 
professionals to reveal how AWS user organizations are responding to evolving cloud security threats, 
and what tools and best practices cybersecurity leaders prioritize as their cloud infrastructures mature.

Key survey findings include:

• Virtually all organizations in our survey have some public cloud footprint. While AWS is still the 

predominant cloud provider, a majority of organizations (87%) use two or more cloud providers. 

• More than two of three organizations (67%) use between three to six different dashboards to 
configure cloud security policies, significantly increasing the cost and complexity of managing 
security across multi\-cloud environments.

• Ninety\-five percent of organizations agree that it would be helpful to have a single cloud 

security platform with a single dashboard to configure all policies needed to consistently and 
comprehensively protect data across their cloud footprint.

• Eighty\-one percent of organizations have an intermediate to leading cloud maturity level. 

However, despite this growing maturity level with the cloud, consistent with previous years, 95% 
of security professionals are moderate to extremely concerned about the security of public 
clouds, signaling a need for adoption of better security tools and practices.

• Fifty\-eight percent of organizations state that they will deploy a new cloud security solution in 

the coming year.

We would like to thank Fidelis Cybersecurity for supporting this important research. 

We hope you find this report informative and helpful as you continue your efforts in securing your 
journey into the cloud.

Thank you,

2022 AWS CLOUD SECURITY REPORTCLOUD DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES

Virtually all organizations now have some public cloud footprint. While AWS is still the predominant 
cloud provider, an overwhelming majority of organizations (87%) use two or more cloud providers.

However, the more cloud providers an organization uses, the more inherently complex the 
infrastructure becomes. The addition of multiple cloud\-native security tools compounds challenges 
for security teams. These solutions add their proprietary methods and dashboards for policy/
rule configuration, along with varying techniques and cadences for monitoring, reporting, and 
remediating security issues.

2022 AWS CLOUD SECURITY REPORTCLOUD SECURITY CONCERNS

Eighty\-one percent of organizations have an intermediate to leading cloud maturity level. However, 
despite this growing maturity level with the cloud, consistent with previous years, 95% of security 
professionals are moderately to extremely concerned about the security of public clouds. This 
continued trend signals a critical need for cloud security solutions that keep pace with increasingly 
complex environments and evolving threat landscapes.

2022 AWS CLOUD SECURITY REPORTCLOUD SECURITY INCIDENTS

Security incidents happen. For the 31% of organizations that experienced a security incident 
in the cloud, misconfiguration was the leading cause (28%), followed by inappropriately shared 
data (17%) and account compromise (15%). Exploited vulnerabilities account for 13% of incidents, 
highlighting a need for automated compliance monitoring to catch common issues.

Sixty\-two percent of organizations use native cloud security controls rather than an independent 
security vendor for their cloud security needs. The most important decision factors include cost 
(63%), solution complexity (58%), and ease of use (57%).

More than two of three organizations (67%) use between three to six different dashboards to 
configure cloud security policies, significantly increasing the cost and complexity of managing 
security across multi\-cloud environments. Utilizing multiple configuration solutions also negatively 
impacts security posture, highlighting the need for comprehensive security solutions for multi and 
hybrid cloud deployments.

We asked cybersecurity professionals about their biggest operational, day\-to\-day headaches 
when protecting cloud workloads. While cloud\-native security tools offer beneficial coverage of 
their environments, the more complex a multi\-cloud environment grows, the more challenging it is 
to keep an organization secure. The biggest challenges security professionals highlighted include 
a lack of qualified staff (47%), followed by compliance (41%) and visibility issues (38%).

2022 AWS CLOUD SECURITY REPORTCLOUD COMPLIANCE CHALLENGES

Cloud compliance presents additional challenges, which increase significantly with the number 
of cloud providers. Fifty\-six percent of cybersecurity professionals cite an increase in staffing 
challenges with diverse cloud implementations. For every cloud provider, security staff must 
understand the organization’s security policies and compliance requirements and how to 
implement those policies. Knowledge of CIS benchmarks and cloud security best practices across 
multiple cloud providers is also required.

2022 AWS CLOUD SECURITY REPORTSINGLE CLOUD SECURITY PLATFORM

We asked cyber professionals how helpful it would be to have a unified cloud security platform 
with a single dashboard. Security leaders overwhelmingly see the value in such a solution. Ninety\-
five percent of organizations agree that it would be moderately to extremely helpful to have a 
single cloud security platform with a dashboard to configure all policies needed to consistently 
and comprehensively protect data across their cloud footprint.

2022 AWS CLOUD SECURITY REPORTCLOUD\-NATIVE SECURITY DRIVERS

Unified security solutions that are made in the cloud, for the cloud, solve many of the key challenges 
around multi\-cloud security. Issues addressed by a unified solution include visibility, scalability, 
and deployment speed, and they can even reduce costs. Our survey participants confirm that the 
biggest drivers for cloud\-based security solutions include better scalability (56%), faster time to 
deployment (54%), and cost savings (42%).

SECURITY VENDORS

Product features (59%) and cost (59%) are the main reasons cybersecurity professionals consider 
switching cloud security vendors. Additional considerations include lack of integration with existing 
solutions (30%) and solution complexity (29%). A unified cloud security solution can normalize 
controls across infrastructures as multi\-cloud installations increase. Benefits include reducing 
costs by eliminating vendor contracts, providing improved integration with existing workflows 
regardless of the cloud provider, and significantly easing deployment and operational management 
complexities.
