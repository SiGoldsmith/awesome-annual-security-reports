Cloud environments are increasingly complex, while threats continually evolve. This trend makes simplified cybersecurity imperative to meet both operations and compliance requirements. To close security gaps, organizations are looking for unified cybersecurity platforms to better manage complexity and maintain both visibility and control.

The 2022 AWS Cloud Security Report is based on a comprehensive survey of 578 cybersecurity professionals to reveal how AWS user organizations are responding to evolving cloud security threats, and what tools and best practices cybersecurity leaders prioritize as their cloud infrastructures mature.

Key survey findings include:
- Virtually all organizations in our survey have some public cloud footprint. While AWS is still the predominant cloud provider, a majority of organizations (87%) use two or more cloud providers.
- More than two of three organizations (67%) use between three to six different dashboards to configure cloud security policies, significantly increasing the cost and complexity of managing security across multi-cloud environments.
- Ninety-five percent of organizations agree that it would be helpful to have a single cloud security platform with a single dashboard to configure all policies needed to consistently and comprehensively protect data across their cloud footprint.
- Eighty-one percent of organizations have an intermediate to leading cloud maturity level. However, despite this growing maturity level with the cloud, consistent with previous years, 95% of security professionals are moderate to extremely concerned about the security of public clouds, signaling a need for adoption of better security tools and practices.
- Fifty-eight percent of organizations state that they will deploy a new cloud security solution in the coming year.

We would like to thank Fidelis Cybersecurity for supporting this important research.
We hope you find this report informative and helpful as you continue your efforts in securing your journey into the cloud.

Thank you,

## CLOUD DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES
How many cloud providers does your organization currently use?

Virtually all organizations now have some public cloud footprint. While AWS is still the predominant cloud provider, an overwhelming majority of organizations (87%) use two or more cloud providers.

However, the more cloud providers an organization uses, the more inherently complex the infrastructure becomes. The addition of multiple cloud-native security tools compounds challenges for security teams. These solutions add their proprietary methods and dashboards for policy/rule configuration, along with varying techniques and cadences for monitoring, reporting, and remediating security issues.

![Image description: Pie chart showing cloud provider usage. 1% None, 12% One, 40% Two, 24% Three, 23% More than three. Text overlay: 87% of organizations that are in the cloud use two or more cloud providers.]

## CLOUD SECURITY CONCERNS
How concerned are you about the security of public clouds?
How would you describe your organization’s cloud maturity level?

Eighty-one percent of organizations have an intermediate to leading cloud maturity level. However, despite this growing maturity level with the cloud, consistent with previous years, 95% of security professionals are moderately to extremely concerned about the security of public clouds. This continued trend signals a critical need for cloud security solutions that keep pace with increasingly complex environments and evolving threat landscapes.

![Image description: Bar chart showing cloud maturity level. 2% No cloud readiness, 17% Early adopter, experimental, 51% Intermediate, repeatable, 24% Advanced, well-architected, 6% Leader, fully automated. Text overlay: 95% organizations are concerned about cloud security, which is consistent with the findings over the past three years.]

![Image description: Bar chart showing level of concern about cloud security. 30% Extremely concerned, 41% Moderately concerned, 24% Very concerned, 5% Slightly concerned.]

## CLOUD SECURITY INCIDENTS
Did your organization experience a public cloud related security incident in the last 12 months?
If yes, what type of incident was it (select all that apply)?

Security incidents happen. For the 31% of organizations that experienced a security incident in the cloud, misconfiguration was the leading cause (28%), followed by inappropriately shared data (17%) and account compromise (15%). Exploited vulnerabilities account for 13% of incidents, highlighting a need for automated compliance monitoring to catch common issues.

![Image description: Pie chart showing security incident experience. 31% Yes, 69% No.]

![Image description: Bar chart showing types of security incidents. 28% Wrongly configured resource or account, 17% Data or files shared inappropriately by a user, 15% Account compromise, 14% Data or files uploaded to an unsanctioned cloud resource, 13% Vulnerability exploited, 10% Data or files downloaded to an unsafe device, 9% Malware infection, 7% Other.]

## CLOUD NATIVE SECURITY VS INDEPENDENT
Do you prefer cloud native security controls or using an independent security vendor for your cloud security needs?
What criteria are most important to you when deciding between cloud native vs independent cloud security solutions?

Sixty-two percent of organizations use native cloud security controls rather than an independent security vendor for their cloud security needs. The most important decision factors include cost (63%), solution complexity (58%), and ease of use (57%).
