Introduction

As organizations continue to migrate to or manage their private, 
public, hybrid cloud or multicloud environments, security should 
be an integral part of the process. Unfortunately, embedding 
security in every step of your organization’s cloud journey can be 
challenging. For this reason, IBM Security® X\-Force® produces 
the Cloud Threat Landscape Report, now in its third year of 
publication, to aid clients and the broader community with their 
cloud security strategy. This report uses research based on a 
review of data from multiple cloud service providers (CSPs).

To produce this report, X\-Force reviewed data compiled between 
July 2021 through June 2022 and gleaned from the 
following sources:

 – IBM Security X\-Force Threat Intelligence
 – IBM Security X\-Force Red penetration tests
 – X\-Force incident response (IR) engagements 
 – Dark web insights from X\-Force analysis
 – Intelligence provided by report contributor Intezer 

Our findings reveal the various ways we’ve observed threat 
actors compromising cloud environments and what types of 
malicious activity are pursued once they’re inside. Additionally, 
organizations learn how they can prepare and react to security 
incidents involving their cloud environments more effectively.

2022 IBM Security X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape ReportKey takeaways

Excess privilege is a concerning problem in the cloud 
 – Data from the X\-Force Red penetration testing indicates that in 
99% of the cases analyzed, cloud identities have been found 
to be excessively privileged. This setup allows any attacker 
who gains a foothold in the environment to pivot and move 
laterally to exploit additional cloud components or assets. 

Vulnerability exploitation leads the way
 – 26% of X\-Force IR engagements involving successful cloud 

compromises were a direct result of an exploited 
vulnerable application.

 – Cloud vulnerabilities continue to surge. As of this publication, 
X\-Force has tracked over 3,200 cloud\-related vulnerabilities, 
which represents a 540% increase in the last six years, and a 
28% increase in new vulnerabilities compared to last year.

The average severity of cloud vulnerabilities has been 
steadily increasing
 – In addition to more vulnerabilities to track and fix, X\-Force Red 

data indicates that overall, these threats are also 
increasing in severity. 

 – Threat severity has increased from an average score of 15 in 

2012 to an average IBM risk score of 18 over the 
past 12 months.

X\-Force observed over 100,000 cloud accounts being 
advertised on the dark web
 – That amount is more than a 200% increase over what was 

found in the 2021 analysis. 

Threat actors are selling access through Remote Desktop 
Protocol (RDP) and credentials
 – X\-Force analysis of dark web markets shows that 76% 
of cloud account sales are in the form of RDP access. 
Another 19% comes in the form of compromised 
credentials to cloud accounts.

 – The average sale price in a cloud\-related transaction is 

USD 10\.27\.

 – Stolen or compromised credentials demand a 47% higher 

selling price than RDP access.

Threat actors continue investing in cloud targeting
 – Cryptominers and ransomware remain the top dropped 

malware into cloud environments.

 – Based on X\-Force data, Monero cryptominers appear 

to be the most widely deployed, namely XMRig.

IBM Security 
X\-Force incident 
response insights

The IBM Security X\-Force IR team reviewed engagements 
involving cloud\-related incidents over the past year and 
identified the following most common attack vectors and 
industry trends impacting cloud infrastructure:

Scanning for and exploiting vulnerable 
infrastructure was the most commonly 
observed initial access vector in cloud 
environments, based on X\-Force responding 
to related cases. This vector represented 
the initial infection vector for 26% of cloud 
incidents. Stolen credential use was the 
second most observed at 9%. 

Manufacturing led all industries with 21% of all 
cloud\-related incidents that X\-Force responded 
to in the past year. This trend matches what we 
see in other areas of the cyberthreat landscape 
such as ransomware targeting. 

Every geographic region of the world 
experienced cloud attacks. Our IR experience 
reflects that threat actors have significant and 
growing cloud expertise. With few exceptions, 
these threat actors operate unconstrained by a 
client’s cloud hosting preferences, rules of law 
or any physical geographic boundaries. 

5

2022 IBM Security X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape ReportInitial access vectors

Exploitation of public\-facing applications
Vulnerable public\-facing applications running in a cloud 
environment are common targets for threat actors. Organizations 
face the difficult task of cataloging all applications running in 
an environment and helping to ensure all remain patched and 
appropriately monitored. X\-Force routinely observed threat 
actors making use of bulk vulnerability scanning for exploitation 
in cloud environments. The Log4j vulnerability and a vulnerability 
in VMware Cloud Director were two of the more commonly 
leveraged vulnerabilities in IR engagements. 

Log4j: The Log4j vulnerability had a significant impact across all 
sectors due to the Apache Log4j library being widely deployed 
among cloud services and within the infrastructure of major 
cloud providers. Additionally, the Log4j vulnerability, disclosed in 
December 2021, was quickly used by malicious actors.

 – Linux® malware families were early exploiters of Log4j, 
including B1txor20, Elknot, Kinsing, Mirai, Muhstik 
and Monero cryptominers.

 – Ransomware groups such as Conti and NightSky also exploited 

the Log4j vulnerability. 

VMware: VMware Cloud Director allows providers to operate 
and manage their cloud infrastructure to gain visibility into 
data centers across sites and geographies. A vulnerability 
in Cloud Director (CVE\-2022\-22966\) allows an attacker to 
perform remote code execution to gain access to servers. This 
vulnerability can potentially expose sensitive data and lead 
to a loss of control of private clouds within an infrastructure. 
Interestingly, many of the major vulnerabilities that were heavily 
exploited in the past year primarily affected the on\-premises 
version of applications, sparing the cloud instances. Examples 
include the Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell/ProxyLogon 
vulnerabilities as well as the Atlassian Confluence vulnerability 
(CVE\-2021\-26084\).

Misconfiguration missteps lead to brute force
According to Intezer, another common access vector into 
cloud environments is misconfiguration. Research points to 
the risks behind misconfigured workflow management 
platforms, including Apache Airflow and Argo Workflows. 
Each platform has its own security challenges, and Intezer 
discovered thousands of exposed credentials, sensitive data 
and cryptojacking campaigns.

The danger of leaked credentials is that threat actors can 
use them to gain unauthorized access to cloud environments. 
The attackers then have the permissions of the exposed 
credentials, essentially allowing them to infiltrate the 
organization while staying undetected. X\-Force IR data 
revealed that many cloud intrusions were the result of some 
form of brute force attack. Some examples include credential 
stuffing and password spraying.

Attacker objectives: Cryptomining and 
sometimes extortion

X\-Force data analysis allowed us to determine common 
actions that threat actors took upon successful compromise 
of cloud environments. These observations generally mirror 
the trends observed and reported in the 2021 X\-Force Cloud 
Threat Landscape Report. While cloud environments have been 
targeted for attempted data extortion, much of the threat activity 
appeared to be concentrated on using compromised access to 
cloud resources for cryptomining. 

Why threat actors choose the cloud to mine 
The threat actors behind cryptomining activity are likely 
attracted to cloud platforms for the following reasons: 

1\. Cryptomining activity is highly resource intensive and 

therefore costly. By leveraging compromised infrastructure, 
threat actors can transfer the cost onto the victim. 

2\. Actors may count on cloud resources receiving less thorough 
and vigilant monitoring compared to on\-premises resources, 
allowing mining malware to operate longer before being 
detected and removed. 

3\. High\-profile vulnerabilities in internet\-facing infrastructure—

such as the Log4j vulnerability—have enabled threat 
actors to attempt to scan, exploit and deploy cryptominers 
opportunistically and at scale. 

Based on X\-Force data, threat actors showed a preference for 
Monero cryptominers. The top cryptominer observed was XMRig, 
which was delivered through a variety of methods, including 
malicious shell scripts and Kinsing malware.

2022 IBM Security X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape ReportNotable threat actors targeting cloud for cryptomining 
A few notable groups have been observed within the past year 
that emphasize cryptominer distribution. X\-Force observed 
activity involving the Rocke Group, a threat group that deploys 
Monero miners to compromised cloud environments. 

(MFA) or password policies or both. Insufficiently protected 
public assets, such as public storage buckets, internet\-facing 
databases with poor authentication controls and overly 
permissive network access rules or unpatched systems also 
showed up in this year’s penetration tests.

An expanding attack surface: 
Cloud vulnerabilities 

X\-Force Red Vulnerability Management Services (VMS) provides 
insights on known vulnerabilities in cloud environments. X\-Force 
is currently tracking over 3,200 cloud\-related vulnerabilities, 
a 540% increase in the last six years. Year\-over\-year shows a 
roughly 28% increase in new vulnerabilities compared to our 
2021 report, as shown in Figure 1\.

Figure 1\. The number of tracked cloud vulnerabilities has 
grown exponentially in the last decade.

X\-Force also observed multiple compromises of cloud 
infrastructures by the Outlaw Group. This group was first 
observed in 2020 and appeared to go dark, but reemerged in 
2022\. Outlaw has several tools in its arsenal, including IRC 
shellbots, XHide and the XorDDoS Linux rootkit, and has been 
deploying XMRig cryptomining malware on compromised 
cloud infrastructures. 

Other notable groups targeting cloud environments include 
publicly reported campaigns of the following threat actors:

 – TeamTNT, which targets cloud infrastructure
 – LemonDuck, which targets Docker cloud instances 
 – Denonia cryptominer, which targets AWS Lambda 
 – CoinStomp, which as of this publication primarily targets cloud 

service providers in Asia 

Exfiltration, extortion and data destruction
X\-Force also observed cases in which threat actors targeted 
cloud environments after compromising enterprise networks. 
In some cases, this targeting takes place in parallel to a 
ransomware infection or as a standalone effort to gain access to 
data that’s being stored using cloud solutions. Threat actors with 
this access may threaten or choose to exfiltrate, leak or 
destroy the data. 

Excessive privilege aiding 
lateral movement

X\-Force Red found that in 99% of cloud penetration tests 
conducted in 2021, cloud identities, meaning human users 
and service accounts, were excessively privileged. This setup 
enabled attackers who managed to get a foothold in the 
environment to pivot and move laterally to exploit additional 
cloud components or assets. Excessively privileged users can be 
defined as ones who have more permissions than they need to 
do their job or task.

Excessive permissions was part of the most common 
misconfiguration X\-Force Red observed in cloud penetration 
tests conducted in the last year. Joining excessive permissions 
was poor cloud account application programming interfaces 
(API) access policies, which lack multifactor authentication 

7

2022 IBM Security X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape ReportIt stands to reason that as the number of available cloud\-based 
applications rises, more cloud\-related vulnerabilities will be 
disclosed, which increases the overall attack surface for cloud 
environments. Not all vulnerabilities are created equal, however. 

This information is inserted into a risk formula that scores the 
threat based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System 
(CVSS) score, the potential damage possible, difficulty and utility 
to an attacker. 

When it comes to prioritizing vulnerabilities, X\-Force Red 
uses a multifaceted ranking algorithm to score the severity of 
vulnerabilities with a “risk score.” The risk score uses a variety of 
factors, such as ease of use, level of access granted and impact 
on the affected system, to accurately measure vulnerabilities. 

X\-Force Red data shows that the average threat score over 
the past decade has steadily been increasing. A huge uptick 
has occurred in the total number of cloud\-related Common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) being tracked. The average 
threat score for the past one year is 18, compared to 15 in 2012\.

Dark web and cloud

X\-Force researchers regularly gather intelligence from the dark 
web to better understand the environment where threat actors 
typically trade. Various forums and marketplaces exist where 
access to cloud accounts are requested, traded and sold to the 
highest bidder. 

The following analysis is based on X\-Force dark web research 
from June 2021 to June 2022\. During this timeframe, X\-Force 
observed over 100,000 cloud accounts being advertised on 
the dark web—a more than threefold increase of 200% over 
what we observed during the previous year. Cloud accounts 
are advertised for nearly all cloud service providers, with 
AWS and Azure Cloud together representing 90% of observed 
compromised cloud accounts for sale.

Understanding what type of cloud access that threat actors 
are selling can help us understand how they managed to 
compromise accounts. Figure 3 shows the most common 
types of cloud access sold, according to our analysis. 

RDP: RDP represents credentials for Windows\-based systems 
running on a cloud resource. Certain factors, such as available 
resources, can influence the perceived value of the account. 
For example, a system with more RAM and processing capability 
will usually demand a higher price when compared to one 
with lesser resources.

Credentials: This cloud access includes login username and 
password combinations for cloud accounts. Credentials can also 
encompass a variety of additional host information pertaining 
to the infected system. In most cases, this cloud access 
includes the operating system version, IP address and other 
data captured by various information\-stealing malware such as 
additional credentials for other services.

Shell: Shell access likely indicates the ability to initiate a reverse 
shell connection on the targeted resource.

Email: In the form of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), these 
accounts allow threat actors to send out spam and phishing 
emails. Account\-specific settings such as how many daily emails 
can be sent have the potential to impact the selling price. 

cPanel, also known as WebHost Manager: WebHost Manager 
(WHM) is an administrative access tool that allows users to 
manage the back end of cPanel accounts. cPanel is a Linux\-
based graphical interface that allows an end user to 
manage the server. 

Figure 3\. RDP makes up more than three\-fourths of cloud 
access sold over a 12\-month period.

Figure 4\. A notable difference exists between demands of 
pricing for RDP compared to credentials. 

Threat actors use multiple marketplaces and forums to advertise 
items for sale on the dark web. Our analysis of postings 
from June 2021 to June 2022 allowed us to extract pricing 
information from various dark web marketplaces, 
as shown in Figure 4\.

The average prices as described in this graphic came from 
analysis of over 52,000 forum postings across multiple dark 
web marketplaces. This review allowed us to compare prices 
between two of the most common access types: credentials and 
RDP. We observed that login credentials demand a higher price 
than RDP access by approximately 47%. One reason for this 
difference is likely because postings that advertise credentials 
often include multiple sets of login data, potentially from other 
services that were stolen along with the cloud credentials.

Recommendations 
for preparation and 
response to 
cloud breaches

Whether you’ve already implemented a cloud solution or are 
in the beginning stages of cloud migration, engaging a trusted 
advisor to guide your cloud security initiatives is essential. 
IBM Cloud Security Strategy Services can aid in identifying 
cybersecurity gaps and help implement and manage the 
following recommendations: 

Preparation

 – Extend monitoring and detection capabilities to cloud 
environments with IBM Security QRadar XDR Connect. 
Determine and enable audit logging requirements in cloud 
environments. Use cloud\-native tools and technologies to 
monitor malicious activity and evidence of compromise with 
products like IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center.

 – Utilize an IBM zero trust security strategy to include 

implementation of MFA and the principle of least privilege. 
This strategy is especially important for private clouds that 
may interact with other on\-premises assets on a regular basis.

 – Consult X\-Force Red Cloud Penetration Testing Services to 
find and fix flaws that may expose your cloud and container 
environment to attackers. Manual testing can help uncover 
flaws that tools alone can’t find such as misconfigurations 
and excessive privileges.

10

2022 IBM Security X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report – Engage X\-Force Red Adversary Simulations Services to 
perform exercises using cloud\-based scenarios to train 
and practice effective cloud\-based incident response.

 – Establish device or service activation, or both, and 

deactivation best practices that incorporate vulnerability 
and policy compliance scanning and remediation through 
the system’s lifecycle.

 – Implement provisioning policies and enforce rules to 

govern the lifecycle of deployed resources, including who 
can provision resources and their types, duration and the 
placement of those resources. 

• This control is necessary to reduce the risk of exposing a 

cloud environment to external threats.

• Use automation extensively to remove human error 

 – Where possible, use an open and integrated security 

as possible.

 – Review if your organization has the right tools and personnel 
for responding to a cloud breach and that your IR playbooks 
are specifically designed for cloud\-based breaches with 
proactive services included in an IBM Security X\-Force 
Incident Response Retainer. If your team is smaller or missing 
the required skill, retain third\-party services that can respond 
as needed.

Reacting

 – Implement IBM Security QRadar SOAR to help your 

organization with AI and automate incident response and 
malware analysis when feasible. This process can help reduce 
response time and overall average cost of breaches associated 
with cloud environments.

 – Preserve forensic artifacts during an investigation by 

redeploying—not reimaging—affected machines. This approach 
allows for subsequent investigation into how the breach 
occurred and what else the threat actors may have done while 
in the organization’s environment.

 – Use IBM Security Threat Intelligence during an incident 

response to use knowledge of the threat actor to speed up 
response times and enable more thorough response activities.

approach, which can help connect the dots between security 
data that resides across fragmented cloud environments. 
Consider security platforms that rely on open technologies 
and allow for tight integrations between tools, such as 
IBM Cloud Pak® for Security.

 – Implement virtual network segmentation to restrict access to 
resources and reduce the risk of lateral movement in the case 
of a compromise. 

 – Use solutions enabling strong data protection, such as 

IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services and IBM Security 
Guardium Data Protection especially for all forms of 
sensitive data, to provide a deeper level of protection against 
unauthorized access and theft.

 – Deploy a bastion host to isolate private cloud network zones 
from external, less trusted or untrusted networks, including 
the internet. This activity reduces the cloud attack surface and 
minimizes the risk of unauthorized access to cloud resources. 
Firewalls and load balancers can be helpful in filtering traffic 
in relevant gates to the cloud environment.

 – Implement cloud web application defenses, including 

controls, such as a web application firewall and 
vulnerability management for applications and 
unmanaged cloud resources.

 – Implement and enforce strong access control practices, 

including the principle of least privilege for cloud identities, 
MFA for privileged accounts, and accounts accessing cloud 
resources through federated services. 

• Ensure systems are regularly tested for policy compliance.

• Automate security group privileges and new user creation to 

least privilege by default.

• Remove users promptly when decommissioning and 

automate blocking after an idle period to minimize the risk of 
ghost users that can be compromised by attackers.

• Modernize identity and access management (IAM) with 

IBM Security IAM solutions to reduce reliance on username 
and password combinations and combat threat actor 
credential theft.
