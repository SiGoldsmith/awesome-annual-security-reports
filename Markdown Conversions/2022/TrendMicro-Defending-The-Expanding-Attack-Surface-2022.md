The first half of 2022 saw large sections of the workforce either returning to the physical workplace or transitioning to a hybrid setup consisting of a combination of both work-from-home (WFH) and on-site work. For many organizations that have transitioned their employees to remote working environments during the past couple of years, these changes mean facing an ever-growing attack surface in the new normal, where security teams must contend with the challenge of defending all possible sections of the IT infrastructure.

Ransomware developers continued their shift toward more lucrative and efficient monetization methods, particularly the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model that has been credited as one of the key reasons for the rapid spread of ransomware attacks. In the first half of the year, three RaaS threat actors stood above the rest: Conti, LockBit, and BlackCat, each of which saw significantly higher detections in the first half of the year compared to the first half of 2021, indicating that cybercriminals are increasingly turning toward a RaaS partnership due to the benefits it provides for both parties. We also observed relatively new ransomware families such as Black Basta, Nokoyawa, and Hive being used in high-profile attacks on big-game targets.

The first half of 2022 also saw the emergence of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups that employed sophisticated toolkits and expansive infrastructure in their campaigns. At the same time, threat actors continued to turn to commodity malware, integrating older tools and malware into their attack routines for their capabilities and reliability. We have also observed that cybercriminals are seemingly looking to expand their operations beyond non-Windows operating systems, with Linux increasingly coming under fire. In their endless pursuit to benefit from any situation, malicious actors also capitalized on the Russia-Ukraine hostilities to launch cyberattacks on either side or prey on people interested in the conflict.

Based on Trend Micro™ Zero Day Initiative™ (ZDI) data, there was a rise in the number of published vulnerability advisories in general, as well as in critical- and high-severity flaws during the first half of 2022. We focused on some of the noteworthy critical vulnerabilities that targeted crucial business tools and software that are used in enterprise systems while also taking note of the vulnerabilities that affected macOS and Linux. We also delved into the Data Distribution Service Standard (DDS) and the vulnerabilities that might have a potential impact on the machines and devices that use this standard.

The cloud remains a popular target for malicious actors, with some capitalizing on old and persistent issues such as misconfiguration and others attempting to develop more novel and unconventional methods to launch attacks on cloud infrastructure.

In our 2022 midyear roundup, we examine the most significant trends and incidents that influenced the cybersecurity landscape in the first half of the year. We also review our 2022 security predictions to see which ones aligned with the trends in the first six months of the year. Through this report, we hope to enlighten users and organizations not just on the different threats that they face but also the robust security measures and policies that they need to consider to protect their environments and systems in the face of a growing attack surface that requires equally capable and extensive security measures.

# Threat Actors Focus on Advancing Capabilities, Expanding the Digital Attack Surface, and Capitalizing on Current Issues

## Organizations Express Concern Over the Growing Attack Surface

Over the past few years, many companies have risen to the challenge of digital transformation by adopting digital technologies to modify their existing business models, processes, and company cultures. This transformation has subsequently created a wider digital attack surface that encompasses a broader range of areas, including email inboxes, internet-of-things (IoT) devices, mobile applications, websites, public cloud services, and even the supply-chain infrastructure.

In a study we conducted in partnership with Sapio Research, we surveyed 6,297 IT security decision-makers from 29 countries about their thoughts on the risks brought about by the growing attack surface.[^1] We discovered that a significant number (73%) of them were concerned about the size of their digital attack surface. 37% described their situation as constantly evolving and messy, while another 43% argued that the attack surface is spiraling out of control.

Despite these concerns, 62% of the respondents admitted to having blind spots that weaken their security posture. 37% of the organizations also claimed to have the least insight into cloud assets. 35% said the same of their insights into networks, while 32% responded that they have the least insight into their end-user assets.

It also became clear that a number of these organizations were uncertain about how to proceed given the risks that they face. 38% of respondents identified quantifying cyber risk as their primary challenge, while 33% stated that they simply lack the resources to understand and manage these risks. Another 32% cited that they have limited visibility into the areas that are at risk.

## Threat Actors Like Earth Lusca and Earth Berberoka Continue to Use Wide-Ranging Tools and Extensive Infrastructure in Their Attacks

The first half of 2022 saw the continuation of targeted campaigns involving APT groups that play the long game by employing large infrastructure and integrating different kinds of malware and other tools in their attacks.

One of the prominent APT groups from the first half of 2022 was the Earth Lusca, a threat actor that has been active since mid-2021[^2] and which conducts cyberespionage and financially motivated campaigns targeting a wide range of organizations around the world by using spear-phishing lures and watering holes.

6 | Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

The group employs infrastructure that can be divided into two clusters. The first is built via rented virtual private servers (VPSs) that are used for Earth Lusca’s social engineering attacks. The group also uses these as their command-and-control (C&C) servers. In particular, Earth Lusca uses the C&C server that is connected to this cluster to deploy a number of malware families such as Cobalt Strike, ShadowPad, Funny Switch, and Winnti.

The second cluster is composed of compromised servers that run older, open-source versions of Oracle GlassFish Server. This cluster is used for vulnerability scanning in public-facing servers and building traffic tunnels within the network. The group also uses it as a C&C server for Cobalt Strike.

*Figure 3. Earth Lusca’s infection routine showing the two clusters the group employs in its attacks*

The image is a diagram showing the infection routine of Earth Lusca. It shows two clusters:
- On the left side, labeled "Compromised servers" with an arrow pointing to "Public-facing server" then "Internal servers" and then a C&C callback.
- On the right side, labeled "VPSs" with arrows pointing to "Victim's computer" then "C&C callback" and "CobaltStrike callback".
There are also arrows showing "Exploit recon", "Watering hole", "Spear phishing", "Lateral movement", "EarthWorm tunneling", and "VPN/Proxy servers".
The text "Threat actor (China)" is above the diagram.

A large portion of the threat actor’s primary victims seem to be high-value targets such as government and educational institutions, political groups, news media, and even Covid-19 research organizations.

In April 2022, we published a research paper documenting the activities of an APT group we named Earth Berberoka that primarily targets gambling websites in China.[^3] The group, which has been active since at least 2020, uses a wide range of malware families that share the same back-end infrastructure despite targeting different operating systems (Windows, Linux, and macOS).

In addition to its extensive list of malware families, Earth Berberoka employs several different infection vectors: an allegedly secure chat app called MiMi, a bogus cryptocurrency app, and a website hosting a malicious Adobe Flash Player installer.

Another notable intrusion set we encountered in the first half of 2022 is NetDooka, a multicomponent malware framework that is distributed via a pay-per-install (PPI) service.[^4] The framework, which contains a loader, a dropper, a protection driver, and a remote access trojan (RAT), uses the PrivateLoader malware for distribution. According to a report from Intel471, PrivateLoader infects a user’s machine through downloaded pirated software.[^5]

7 | Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

Following infection, it installs the first NetDooka malware, a dropper component that decrypts and executes the loader. After scanning the environment, the loader then downloads another dropper component that is executed by the loader. This dropper will be used for decrypting and executing the final payload, a full-featured RAT that can perform various functions such as starting a remote shell, grabbing browser data, and taking screenshots.

The infrastructure of NetDooka makes it an attractive option for clients that want to avail of the PPI business model for their operations while also allowing their operators the opportunity to easily spread their malware.

## Threat Actors Like Conti Drive Emotet Resurgence

> In our 2022 security predictions, we foresaw that commodity malware would grow into a formidable threat as ransomware operators continuously integrate it into their attacks.

Although new malware families often garner the lion’s share of attention from both the security industry and the general public, older malware, especially those that have proven to be effective, still pose a threat to organizations. In our 2022 security predictions, we mentioned that malicious actors are increasingly turning to commodity malware and other tools to make their attacks more effective.[^6] This has turned out to be an accurate prediction for Emotet, an infamous botnet that is being offered as part of a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) scheme.

*Figure 4. Infection chain used in the Emotet infections we analyzed in May 2022*

The image is a diagram showing the infection chain of Emotet. It is a numbered list of steps with arrows connecting them:
1. Malicious spam with URL (subject is invoice or payment notification)
2. A user selecting a URL in malicious spam leads to a download.
3. Document with malicious macro executes PowerShell command line to download the payload.
4. Drops copy a. %System%\<file name>.exe b.%AppData%\Local\Microsoft\Windows\<file name>.exe
5. Deletes Zone.Identifier ADS
6. Creates service (if with admin rights)
7. List running processes
8. Get system and operation system info
9. Send info to C&C server
10. Execute modules received from C&C server
11. Create autostart registry /h/k/c/u\%regrun% (if without admin rights)
There are also text boxes showing:
- a. With admin rights b. Without admin rights Service name/Regrun value is the same as <file name>.
- a. Update copy b. Spammer module c. Credential stealer module d. Network propagation module
- C&C server sends modules to perform other routines

8 | Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

Emotet made its debut in 2014 and is known to have been used by operators of other malware such as Conti and Ryuk in their attacks. In 2021, its infrastructure was taken down through the collaborative effort of various law enforcement agencies from different countries.[^7]

However, the dismantling of its infrastructure did not signal the end of Emotet. Just a few months later, it was observed being used in a Trickbot campaign.[^8] In the first half of 2022, we saw a massive uptick in Emotet detections compared to those in the first half of 2021, proof that the botnet is thriving as a result of threat actors opting to integrate it into their operations. Indeed, researchers from Advintel named Conti operators as one of the reasons behind Emotet’s recent resurgence.[^9]

*Figure 5. Emotet detections increased by over 10 times in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021, likely due to prolific threat actors using it as part of their operations.*

*Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network*

The image is a bar graph showing the number of Emotet detections in the first half of 2021 and 2022. The 2021 bar is at 13,811 and the 2022 bar is at 148,701.

Based on our Smart Protection Network (SPN) sensors, majority of the Emotet detections occurred in Japan, with the US, India, Italy, and Brazil rounding up the top five. While this does not necessarily indicate that Japan is where Emotet is most active (due to the nature of security sensors), it does show that the malware has high levels of activity in the country.

*Figure 6. The countries with the highest number of Emotet detections*

The image is a bar graph showing the number of Emotet detections in Brazil, Italy, India, US, and Japan. The numbers are:
- Japan: 107,669
- US: 4,837
- India: 3,729
- Italy: 3,442
- Brazil: 3,006

9 | Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

In May 2022, we analyzed Emotet infections across various regions and discovered that while the attacks still relied on spam campaigns, it also added small changes to its routine, such as using Excel 4.0 macros for its downloading procedure instead of using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).[^10] Other changes that were implemented in these recent Emotet infections include streamlined payloads and additional obfuscation techniques. Perhaps most importantly, the operators of Emotet have since added Cobalt Strike to their arsenal since the botnet’s reappearance, making newer Emotet campaigns more dangerous.

## Russia-Ukraine Conflict Extends to the Cybercrime Sphere

On February 24, 2022, the Russia-Ukraine war began. While there has been much focus on physical battles on the ground, it’s important to highlight that cyberattacks targeting both sides were also launched in the ensuing chaos.[^11]

One of the prominent threat actors that became involved early on was Conti, which announced its support for the Russian government just a day after the hostilities started. On its leak site, the group announced that they would strike back at groups or individuals who launched cyberattacks on Russia, although Conti would subsequently soften its stance in a succeeding post.

*Figure 7. Initial statement from the Conti group warning would-be attackers of retaliation should they target Russian infrastructure*

The image is a screenshot of a statement from the Conti group. It reads:
"The Conti Team is officially announcing a full support of Russian government. If anybody will decide to organize a cyberattack or any war activities against Russia, we are going to use our all possible resources to strike back at the critical infrastructures of an enemy."

SPN data shows a spike in BazarLoader detections in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of the previous year — a notable shift since BazarLoader is a key enabler in Conti campaigns.

10 | Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

*Figure 8. There were nearly 10 times as many BazarLoader detections in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021.*

The image is a bar graph showing the number of BazarLoader detections in the first half of 2021 and 2022. The 2021 bar is at 75 and the 2022 bar is at 686.

The Stormous ransomware gang, a group of Arabic-speaking cybercriminals, also announced its support for Russia[^12] and declared that it would target Ukrainian government institutions as part of its plans.

Our analysis of the malware used by Stormous reveals that the group uses it to deploy different kinds of custom payloads to its victim through remote uploading and resources such as Pastebin.

Alongside ransomware groups becoming involved, security researchers observed attacks that, although not directly connected to the ongoing war, were being launched on Ukrainian organizations, websites, and infrastructure even before the conflict began.

In January and February 2022, a wave of spear-phishing emails was sent to Ukrainian targets — ostensibly from Ukrainian organizations such as the National Healthcare Service and the police force — containing attachments that download and execute the OutSteel and SaintBot malware.[^13] It’s possible that these campaigns were carried out for information-gathering purposes as a precursor to the invasion.

On January 13 and 14, 2022, threat actors launched a direct attack on approximately 70 Ukrainian government websites, leading to the defacement of website content and system corruption via the malware WhisperGate.[^14] It is suspected that these attacks were enabled via the content management system OctoberCMS, supply-chain attacks, and the exploitation of the Log4j vulnerability.[^15]

At first glance, these incidents belie the complexity of the attacks launched on either side of the war. As evidenced by a March 2022 campaign that we analyzed, however, these cyberattacks are not a one-way street. In this campaign, operators used a piece of malware called RuRansom designed to infect Russian targets. Although its name implies otherwise, RuRansom is not an example of ransomware but a wiper designed to destroy its victim’s data and backup files. Our discovery of numerous versions of RuRansom indicates that the malware is still under development.

11 | Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

Although several ransomware groups became involved, it would be a mistake to think that ransomware gangs were the only ones to take part in the Russia-Ukraine war. For example, hacktivist collective Anonymous took part in the cyber conflict by targeting Russian assets and information in attacks that included publishing confidential files from the Russian central bank, taking over state-controlled television, and leaking the personal data of Russian military personnel.[^16]

Other malicious actors, while not directly targeting either side of the conflict, still attempted to capitalize on the situation. Through our honeypot, we found war-related spam emails aiming to take advantage of the situation under the guise of asking for donations and using scams to create bogus recipients of such donations. Some of these spam emails drop malware such as Ave Maria as an attachment.[^17]

*Figure 9. A scam email asking recipients for donations to help with Ukrainian relocations*

The image is a screenshot of a scam email. The subject is "Urgent Help Ukraine". The email body reads:
"Dear Friend,
I hope this email finds you well.
I am writing to you today to ask for your help in a time of great need. As you know, the situation in Ukraine is dire, and millions of people have been displaced from their homes.
Many of these people have lost everything and are in need of basic necessities such as food, shelter, and clothing.
I am asking for your help in providing these necessities to those who need them most. Any donation, no matter how small, will make a difference in the lives of these people.
Please consider donating today to help us provide relief to the people of Ukraine.
Thank you for your generosity and support.
Sincerely,
[Name]"

# The Ransomware Threat Landscape Continues to Evolve with New Players and Lucrative Monetization Methods

## LockBit, Conti, and BlackCat Operators Continue to Employ the Profitable RaaS Scheme

> The advent of RaaS has resulted in would-be cybercriminals having access to the tools and infrastructure that would not have been available to them under ordinary circumstances.[^18] One of the unique aspects of the RaaS model is the relationship between the developers and their affiliates who act as middlemen. Affiliates are also responsible for the actual infections and split ransom payment with the developers. This kind of setup provides developers additional time to evolve their malware and tools while also affording them protection from the scrutiny of security researchers and law enforcement. On the other hand, affiliates profit from ransomware attacks without the extensive legwork and infrastructure needed to initiate expansive ransomware campaigns.
>
> We predicted that ransomware operators would implement modern and sophisticated extortion methods while also going after more prominent targets.
>
> Our telemetry data shows that over 50 active RaaS and extortion groups and more than 1,200 organizations were victimized by ransomware in the first half of the year.

*Figure 10. The number of active RaaS and extortion groups and victim organizations of successful ransomware attacks in the first half of 2022*

*Source: RaaS and extortion groups’ leak sites*

The image is a bar graph showing the number of active RaaS and extortion groups and victim organizations in the first half of 2022. The bar for active RaaS and extortion groups is at 57 and the bar for victim organizations is at 1,205.

LockBit, Conti, and BlackCat were the major players in the RaaS field for the first half of 2022.[^19] Based on SPN data, we observed a sharp increase in detections from each of these malware families in the first half of this year. Black Cat, a relatively new ransomware that was initially reported at the tail end of 2021, understandably saw practically nonexistent detections in 2021 before the increase in 2022. However, even older ransomware such as LockBit and Conti saw major increases, with LockBit seeing over five times and Conti nearly twice the number of detections in the first half of 2022 in contrast to the first half of the previous year.

13 | Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

*Figure 11. LockBit, Conti, and BlackCat saw a significant increase in detections in the first six months of 2022 compared to the first half of the previous year: The detection numbers for LockBit, Conti, and BlackCat*

*Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network*

The image is a bar graph showing the number of detections for BlackCat, Conti, and LockBit in the first half of 2021 and 2022. The numbers are:
- BlackCat 2021: 2
- BlackCat 2022: 341
- Conti 2021: 622
- Conti 2022: 1,090
- LockBit 2021: 1,843
- LockBit 2022: 1,397

LockBit, which has been active since 2019 and was initially known as the ABCD ransomware, is the group with the highest number of detections.[^20] In 2020, LockBit launched its RaaS affiliate program using a leak site and a few months later began using the double extortion model where the attacker threatens to publicly expose data in addition to encrypting files. In 2021, one of the prominent incidents involving LockBit occurred when it launched an attack on tech services firm Accenture, even going as far as listing the company on its leak site.[^21]

LockBit has been a staple in the ransomware scene since its debut, with its operators constantly evolving its capabilities to the point where the performance of its RaaS service has become one of the group’s selling points due to its speed and efficiency. LockBit’s network has also garnered popularity for its capability and trustworthiness.

LockBit offers multiple options for infection routines depending on the affiliates involved in the operation, their purpose, and how they gain access to their target’s system. For example, if an affiliate manages to gain access to a virtual private network (VPN) server using brute-force methods, LockBit’s operators might provide an infection routine that is based on remote access service (RAS). On the other hand, the group might offer a PowerShell script to attackers that gain access to a compromised Internet Information Services (IIS) server. In addition to its encryption routines, LockBit attacks were also found to have deployed the post-exploitation tool Mimikatz to gather additional credentials.

*Figure 12. Two of the infection routines used by LockBit: one for when its operators manage to compromise an IIS server, and one for when they manage to compromise a VPN server via brute-force methods*

The image is a diagram showing two infection routines used by LockBit.
- On the left, "Compromised IIS server" with an arrow pointing to "PowerShell script" then "Backdoor (PowerShell Empire)" and then "LockBit ransomware".
- On the right, "Brute-forced VPN server" with an arrow pointing to "SMB/Microsoft RAS" and then "LockBit ransomware".
There is also an arrow from "PowerShell command" to "LockBit ransomware".

14 | Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

Touted as the successor to the notorious Ryuk ransomware,[^22] Conti hit its stride in 2021 with a number of prominent attacks, including incidents where it targeted healthcare institutions in May.[^23]

Like many modern ransomware families, Conti employs more than one method to gain initial access to a victim’s system. Phishing emails remain a common infiltration technique, with attackers using Google Drive links to drop BazarLoader and the attack eventually leading to an infection. Conti can also arrive on a target’s machine by exploiting vulnerabilities like the FortiGate firewall vulnerabilities CVE-2018-13379[^24] and CVE-2018-13374,[^25] as well as various ProxyShell Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities.[^26]

Once inside the system, tools like Whoami, Nltest, and Net are used to provide the attackers some system information, such as the rights and permissions they have gained via the compromised machine. At the same time, the threat actors actively search for files that they can exfiltrate for use in their double extortion technique. If the attackers that deployed Conti find that they need to have access to greater privileges, they might also use exploits like Zerologon[^27] for privilege escalation.

In February 2022, an alleged security researcher leaked some of the ransomware group’s files and documents, revealing information such as the size and leadership of the group.[^28] More importantly, they unearthed the code used by Conti operators for their components and infrastructure, such as the administrator panel, a decryptor, and even Conti Locker v2.

Nevertheless, the leak of such information is a double-edged sword: While it could be instrumental for researchers to use it for keeping track of and gaining insight into Conti’s operation, malicious actors can use the leaked source codes to build their own startup ransomware operation.

*Figure 13. The infection chain used in a typical Conti attack*

The image is a diagram showing the infection chain of a typical Conti attack. It is a series of steps with arrows connecting them:
- Initial Entry and Execution: Firewall exploit, Phishing email, Netscan, ShareFinder, BazarLoader/BazarBackdoor
- Credential Access: Kerberoasting, Net-GPPPassword, ProcDump
- Lateral Movement: ProcDump, Cobalt Strike, Valid accounts, PrintNightmare
- Privilege Escalation: ZeroLogon, Anydesk
- Command and Control: Anydesk, Create scheduled task on remote systems, Cobeacon, KillAV, Conti
- Impact: KillAV, PSExec, Kerberoasting, ProcDump
- Network Discovery
- Exfiltration: Rclone
- Lateral Movement and Defense Evasion: Conti

15 | Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

Although relatively new to the ransomware scene compared to LockBit and Conti, BlackCat still managed to make waves in the months that it was active by going beyond the typical double extortion scheme used by modern ransomware groups. Instead, BlackCat resorted to a “triple extortion” scheme[^29] where it not only threatened to encrypt files and leak sensitive data but also warned its victims that it would launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on their infrastructure if the group’s demands are not met.[^30]

BlackCat’s operators typically exploit exposed and vulnerable applications to gain entry into their target system. They then use third-party frameworks and toolsets such as Cobalt Strike to deliver the ransomware. In April 2022, we launched an investigation into BlackCat via the Trend Micro Vision One™ platform, where we gathered information about its routine. We found that the malicious actors were actively exploiting the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability CVE-2021-31207[^31] to insert a web shell into the victim’s server for remote access. This allows the attackers the ability to remotely perform different tasks like stealing data and dropping malicious tools. The attackers then use these tools to move laterally within the system, scan the environment, and prepare it for eventual BlackCat infection.

Due to BlackCat’s sophistication as the first professional ransomware family to be written in Rust, a secure programming language that has concurrent processing capabilities, as well as its unique monetization method, extensive infrastructure, and wide array of supplementary tools in its attacks, it has the potential to become a staple in the RaaS scene in the foreseeable future.

Based on both our data and data from leak sites, we were able to note that these ransomware families are used mainly to target small businesses with up to 200 employees at most as well as medium-sized businesses with up to 1,000 employees. The likely reason for this is that these types of organizations have less resources and a smaller workforce to properly deal with cyberattacks.[^32]

## Linux Systems Become a Prime Target for Ransomware Operators

> Our 2022 security predictions anticipated that ransomware threat actors would expend more effort on targeting servers, server components, and related services.

Linux systems present an attractive target for malicious actors that are either looking to expand their reach or have decided to concentrate on specific types of infrastructure, such as servers and embedded systems where Linux is expected to see growth over the next few years.[^33]

We observed a 75% increase in ransomware attacks targeting Linux-based machines in the first half of 2022 as opposed to the first half of 2021, lending more evidence to our assumption that malicious actors are focusing more of their efforts on Linux.

16 | Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

*Figure 14. Linux ransomware detections grew significantly in the first half of 2022 as opposed to the first half of 2021: A comparison of ransomware detections for Linux-based machines*

The image is a bar graph showing the number of Linux ransomware detections in the first half of 2021 and 2022. The 2021 bar is at 1,121 and the 2022 bar is at 1,961.

The VMware hypervisor ESXi came under heavy fire in the first half of 2022. Still, there is nothing new about cybercriminals targeting ESXi. RansomEXX[^34], for example, has been exploiting ESXi vulnerabilities in its campaigns since at least 2021[^35] — and it seems that other threat actors are now following suit.

In October 2021, LockBit’s operators announced a Linux-based variant, LockBit Linux-ESXi Locker version 1.0, in an underground forum. This variant targets ESXi servers through a combination of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) algorithms to encrypt data. Since then, samples of this variant have been found in the wild.

In May 2022, a new ransomware variant named Cheerscrypt was also found targeting devices using ESXi.[^36] Based on the source code of the Babuk ransomware that was leaked in September 2021,[^37] Cheerscrypt encrypts log files and other VMware-related files using the double extortion technique.

Although neither LockBit Linux-ESXi Locker version 1.0 nor Cheerscrypt deviates from the typical double extortion scheme used by many other ransomware variants, the potential impact of an infection is notable in this case since ESXi servers are widely used by enterprises for server virtualization. Organizations can also use these servers to host multiple virtual machines (VMs) where they keep important data. This means that they are often part of an organization’s critical infrastructure, and therefore any successful attack on these components can deal great damage to an organization.

## Big Game-Hunting Ransomware Families such as Black Basta and Nokoyawa Hit Organizations Across the Globe

We spotted ransomware operators setting their sights on businesses that have the capacity to pay sizeable ransom demands. Operators of the Black Basta ransomware[^38] struck hard and fast, hitting nearly 50 organizations in a span of a couple of months in early 2022.[^39] Black Basta originated in April 2022, when a user with the name Black Basta posted on some major underground forums that they were looking for corporate network access credentials for organizations in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. The user also mentioned that they were offering a share of the profits to any
