or transitioning to a hybrid setup consisting of a combination of both work\-from\-home (WFH) and 

on\-site work. For many organizations that have transitioned their employees to remote working 

environments during the past couple of years, these changes mean facing an ever\-growing attack 

surface in the new normal, where security teams must contend with the challenge of defending all 

possible sections of the IT infrastructure. 

Ransomware developers continued their shift toward more lucrative and efficient monetization 

methods, particularly the ransomware\-as\-a\-service (RaaS) model that has been credited as one of 

the key reasons for the rapid spread of ransomware attacks. In the first half of the year, three RaaS 

threat actors stood above the rest: Conti, LockBit, and BlackCat, each of which saw significantly 

higher detections in the first half of the year compared to the first half of 2021, indicating that 

cybercriminals are increasingly turning toward a RaaS partnership due to the benefits it provides 

for both parties. We also observed relatively new ransomware families such as Black Basta, 

Nokoyawa, and Hive being used in high\-profile attacks on big\-game targets.

The first half of 2022 also saw the emergence of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups that 

employed sophisticated toolkits and expansive infrastructure in their campaigns. At the same time, 

threat actors continued to turn to commodity malware, integrating older tools and malware into 

their attack routines for their capabilities and reliability. We have also observed that cybercriminals 

are seemingly looking to expand their operations beyond non\-Windows operating systems, with 

Linux increasingly coming under fire. In their endless pursuit to benefit from any situation, malicious 

actors also capitalized on the Russia\-Ukraine hostilities to launch cyberattacks on either side or 

prey on people interested in the conflict.

Based on Trend Micro™ Zero Day Initiative™ (ZDI) data, there was a rise in the number of published 

vulnerability advisories in general, as well as in critical\- and high\-severity flaws during the first 

half of 2022\. We focused on some of the noteworthy critical vulnerabilities that targeted crucial 

business tools and software that are used in enterprise systems while also taking note of the 

vulnerabilities that affected macOS and Linux. We also delved into the Data Distribution Service 

Standard (DDS) and the vulnerabilities that might have a potential impact on the machines and 

devices that use this standard.

The cloud remains a popular target for malicious actors, with some capitalizing on old and 

persistent issues such as misconfiguration and others attempting to develop more novel and 

unconventional methods to launch attacks on cloud infrastructure. 

In our 2022 midyear roundup, we examine the most significant trends and incidents that influenced 

the cybersecurity landscape in the first half of the year. We also review our 2022 security predictions 

to see which ones aligned with the trends in the first six months of the year. Through this report, 

we hope to enlighten users and organizations not just on the different threats that they face 

but also the robust security measures and policies that they need to consider to protect their 

environments and systems in the face of a growing attack surface that requires equally capable 

and extensive security measures.

 Threat Actors Focus on Advancing 
Capabilities, Expanding the Digital 
Attack Surface, and Capitalizing on 
Current Issues

Organizations Express Concern Over 
the Growing Attack Surface

Over the past few years, many companies have risen to the challenge of digital transformation by 

adopting digital technologies to modify their existing business models, processes, and company cultures. 

This transformation has subsequently created a wider digital attack surface that encompasses a broader 

range of areas, including email inboxes, internet\-of\-things (IoT) devices, mobile applications, websites, 

public cloud services, and even the supply\-chain infrastructure. 

In a study we conducted in partnership with Sapio Research, we surveyed 6,297 IT security decision\-

makers from 29 countries about their thoughts on the risks brought about by the growing attack surface.1 

We discovered that a significant number (73%) of them were concerned about the size of their digital 

attack surface. 37% described their situation as constantly evolving and messy, while another 43% 

argued that the attack surface is spiraling out of control.

Despite these concerns, 62% of the respondents admitted to having blind spots that weaken their security 

posture. 37% of the organizations also claimed to have the least insight into cloud assets. 35% said the 

same of their insights into networks, while 32% responded that they have the least insight into their end\-

user assets.

It also became clear that a number of these organizations were uncertain about how to proceed given the 

risks that they face. 38% of respondents identified quantifying cyber risk as their primary challenge, while 

33% stated that they simply lack the resources to understand and manage these risks. Another 32% 

cited that they have limited visibility into the areas that are at risk.

 Threat Actors Like Earth Lusca and 
Earth Berberoka Continue to Use 
Wide\-Ranging Tools and Extensive 
Infrastructure in Their Attacks

The first half of 2022 saw the continuation of targeted campaigns involving APT groups that play the long 

game by employing large infrastructure and integrating different kinds of malware and other tools in their 

attacks. 

One of the prominent APT groups from the first half of 2022 was the Earth Lusca, a threat actor that has 

been active since mid\-20212 and which conducts cyberespionage and financially motivated campaigns 

targeting a wide range of organizations around the world by using spear\-phishing lures and watering holes. 

5 \| Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

The group employs infrastructure that can be divided into two clusters. The first is built via rented virtual 

private servers (VPSs) that are used for Earth Lusca’s social engineering attacks. The group also uses 

these as their command\-and\-control (C\&C) servers. In particular, Earth Lusca uses the C\&C server that 

is connected to this cluster to deploy a number of malware families such as Cobalt Strike, ShadowPad, 

Funny Switch, and Winnti. 

The second cluster is composed of compromised servers that run older, open\-source versions of Oracle 

GlassFish Server. This cluster is used for vulnerability scanning in public\-facing servers and building 

traffic tunnels within the network. The group also uses it as a C\&C server for Cobalt Strike.

Victim’s computer

A large portion of the threat actor’s primary victims seem to be high\-value targets such as government 

and educational institutions, political groups, news media, and even Covid\-19 research organizations. 

In April 2022, we published a research paper documenting the activities of an APT group we named Earth 

Berberoka that primarily targets gambling websites in China.3 The group, which has been active since at 

least 2020, uses a wide range of malware families that share the same back\-end infrastructure despite 

targeting different operating systems (Windows, Linux, and macOS).

In addition to its extensive list of malware families, Earth Berberoka employs several different infection 

vectors: an allegedly secure chat app called MiMi, a bogus cryptocurrency app, and a website hosting a 

malicious Adobe Flash Player installer.

Another notable intrusion set we encountered in the first half of 2022 is NetDooka, a multicomponent 

malware framework that is distributed via a pay\-per\-install (PPI) service.4 The framework, which contains 

a loader, a dropper, a protection driver, and a remote access trojan (RAT), uses the PrivateLoader malware 

for distribution. According to a report from Intel471, PrivateLoader infects a user’s machine through 

downloaded pirated software.5

6 \| Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

 
Following infection, it installs the first NetDooka malware, a dropper component that decrypts and executes 

the loader. After scanning the environment, the loader then downloads another dropper component that 

is executed by the loader. This dropper will be used for decrypting and executing the final payload, a full\-

featured RAT that can perform various functions such as starting a remote shell, grabbing browser data, 

and taking screenshots.

The infrastructure of NetDooka makes it an attractive option for clients that want to avail of the PPI 

business model for their operations while also allowing their operators the opportunity to easily spread 

their malware.

Emotet made its debut in 2014 and is known to have been used by operators of other malware such as 

Conti and Ryuk in their attacks. In 2021, its infrastructure was taken down through the collaborative effort 

of various law enforcement agencies from different countries.7

However, the dismantling of its infrastructure did not signal the end of Emotet. Just a few months later, it 

was observed being used in a Trickbot campaign.8 In the first half of 2022, we saw a massive uptick in 

Emotet detections compared to those in the first half of 2021, proof that the botnet is thriving as a result 

of threat actors opting to integrate it into their operations. Indeed, researchers from Advintel named Conti 

operators as one of the reasons behind Emotet’s recent resurgence.9

Based on our Smart Protection Network (SPN) sensors, majority of the Emotet detections occurred in 

Japan, with the US, India, Italy, and Brazil rounding up the top five. While this does not necessarily 

indicate that Japan is where Emotet is most active (due to the nature of security sensors), it does show 

that the malware has high levels of activity in the country.

In May 2022, we analyzed Emotet infections across various regions and discovered that while the attacks 

still relied on spam campaigns, it also added small changes to its routine, such as using Excel 4\.0 macros 

for its downloading procedure instead of using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).10 Other changes 

that were implemented in these recent Emotet infections include streamlined payloads and additional 

obfuscation techniques. Perhaps most importantly, the operators of Emotet have since added Cobalt 

Strike to their arsenal since the botnet’s reappearance, making newer Emotet campaigns more dangerous.

Russia\-Ukraine Conflict Extends to the 
Cybercrime Sphere

On February 24, 2022, the Russia\-Ukraine war began. While there has been much focus on physical 

battles on the ground, it’s important to highlight that cyberattacks targeting both sides were also launched 

in the ensuing chaos.11

One of the prominent threat actors that became involved early on was Conti, which announced its support 

for the Russian government just a day after the hostilities started. On its leak site, the group announced 

that they would strike back at groups or individuals who launched cyberattacks on Russia, although Conti 

would subsequently soften its stance in a succeeding post.

Figure 7\. Initial statement from the Conti group warning would\-be attackers of retaliation should they 

target Russian infrastructure 

SPN data shows a spike in BazarLoader detections in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 

the previous year — a notable shift since BazarLoader is a key enabler in Conti campaigns.

The Stormous ransomware gang, a group of Arabic\-speaking cybercriminals, also announced its support 

for Russia12 and declared that it would target Ukrainian government institutions as part of its plans.

Our analysis of the malware used by Stormous reveals that the group uses it to deploy different kinds of 

custom payloads to its victim through remote uploading and resources such as Pastebin.

Alongside ransomware groups becoming involved, security researchers observed attacks that, although 

not directly connected to the ongoing war, were being launched on Ukrainian organizations, websites, 

and infrastructure even before the conflict began.

In January and February 2022, a wave of spear\-phishing emails was sent to Ukrainian targets — ostensibly 

from Ukrainian organizations such as the National Healthcare Service and the police force — containing 

attachments that download and execute the OutSteel and SaintBot malware.13 It’s possible that these 

campaigns were carried out for information\-gathering purposes as a precursor to the invasion.

On January 13 and 14, 2022, threat actors launched a direct attack on approximately 70 Ukrainian 

government websites, leading to the defacement of website content and system corruption via the 

malware WhisperGate.14 It is suspected that these attacks were enabled via the content management 

system OctoberCMS, supply\-chain attacks, and the exploitation of the Log4j vulnerability.15

At first glance, these incidents belie the complexity of the attacks launched on either side of the war. As 

evidenced by a March 2022 campaign that we analyzed, however, these cyberattacks are not a one\-way 

street. In this campaign, operators used a piece of malware called RuRansom designed to infect Russian 

targets. Although its name implies otherwise, RuRansom is not an example of ransomware but a wiper 

designed to destroy its victim’s data and backup files. Our discovery of numerous versions of RuRansom 

indicates that the malware is still under development.

10 \| Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

Although several ransomware groups became involved, it would be a mistake to think that ransomware 

gangs were the only ones to take part in the Russia\-Ukraine war. For example, hacktivist collective 

Anonymous took part in the cyber conflict by targeting Russian assets and information in attacks that 

included publishing confidential files from the Russian central bank, taking over state\-controlled television, 

and leaking the personal data of Russian military personnel.16

Other malicious actors, while not directly targeting either side of the conflict, still attempted to capitalize 

on the situation. Through our honeypot, we found war\-related spam emails aiming to take advantage of 

the situation under the guise of asking for donations and using scams to create bogus recipients of such 

donations. Some of these spam emails drop malware such as Ave Maria as an attachment.17

LockBit, Conti, and BlackCat were the major players in the RaaS field for the first half of 2022\.19 Based 

on SPN data, we observed a sharp increase in detections from each of these malware families in the first 

half of this year. Black Cat, a relatively new ransomware that was initially reported at the tail end of 2021, 

understandably saw practically nonexistent detections in 2021 before the increase in 2022\. However, 

even older ransomware such as LockBit and Conti saw major increases, with LockBit seeing over five 

times and Conti nearly twice the number of detections in the first half of 2022 in contrast to the first half 

of the previous year.

LockBit, which has been active since 2019 and was initially known as the ABCD ransomware, is the 

group with the highest number of detections.20 In 2020, LockBit launched its RaaS affiliate program using 

a leak site and a few months later began using the double extortion model where the attacker threatens 

13 \| Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

to publicly expose data in addition to encrypting files. In 2021, one of the prominent incidents involving 

LockBit occurred when it launched an attack on tech services firm Accenture, even going as far as listing 

the company on its leak site.21

LockBit has been a staple in the ransomware scene since its debut, with its operators constantly evolving 

its capabilities to the point where the performance of its RaaS service has become one of the group’s 

selling points due to its speed and efficiency. LockBit’s network has also garnered popularity for its 

capability and trustworthiness.

LockBit offers multiple options for infection routines depending on the affiliates involved in the operation, 

their purpose, and how they gain access to their target’s system. For example, if an affiliate manages 

to gain access to a virtual private network (VPN) server using brute\-force methods, LockBit’s operators 

might provide an infection routine that is based on remote access service (RAS). On the other hand, the 

group might offer a PowerShell script to attackers that gain access to a compromised Internet Information 

Services (IIS) server. In addition to its encryption routines, LockBit attacks were also found to have 

deployed the post\-exploitation tool Mimikatz to gather additional credentials.

Touted as the successor to the notorious Ryuk ransomware,22 Conti hit its stride in 2021 with a number of 

prominent attacks, including incidents where it targeted healthcare institutions in May.23

Like many modern ransomware families, Conti employs more than one method to gain initial access to 

a victim’s system. Phishing emails remain a common infiltration technique, with attackers using Google 

Drive links to drop BazarLoader and the attack eventually leading to an infection. Conti can also arrive on 

a target’s machine by exploiting vulnerabilities like the FortiGate firewall vulnerabilities CVE\-2018\-1337924 

and CVE\-2018\-13374,25 as well as various ProxyShell Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities.26

14 \| Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

Once inside the system, tools like Whoami, Nltest, and Net are used to provide the attackers some 

system information, such as the rights and permissions they have gained via the compromised machine. 

At the same time, the threat actors actively search for files that they can exfiltrate for use in their double 

extortion technique. If the attackers that deployed Conti find that they need to have access to greater 

privileges, they might also use exploits like Zerologon27 for privilege escalation. 

In February 2022, an alleged security researcher leaked some of the ransomware group’s files and 

documents, revealing information such as the size and leadership of the group.28 More importantly, 

they unearthed the code used by Conti operators for their components and infrastructure, such as the 

administrator panel, a decryptor, and even Conti Locker v2\.

Nevertheless, the leak of such information is a double\-edged sword: While it could be instrumental for 

researchers to use it for keeping track of and gaining insight into Conti’s operation, malicious actors can 

use the leaked source codes to build their own startup ransomware operation.

Although relatively new to the ransomware scene compared to LockBit and Conti, BlackCat still managed 

to make waves in the months that it was active by going beyond the typical double extortion scheme used 

by modern ransomware groups. Instead, BlackCat resorted to a “triple extortion” scheme29 where it not 

only threatened to encrypt files and leak sensitive data but also warned its victims that it would launch 

distributed denial\-of\-service (DDoS) attacks on their infrastructure if the group’s demands are not met.30

15 \| Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

BlackCat’s operators typically exploit exposed and vulnerable applications to gain entry into their target 

system. They then use third\-party frameworks and toolsets such as Cobalt Strike to deliver the ransomware. 

In April 2022, we launched an investigation into BlackCat via the Trend Micro Vision One™ platform, where 

we gathered information about its routine. We found that the malicious actors were actively exploiting the 

Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability CVE\-2021\-3120731 to insert a web shell into the victim’s server for 

remote access. This allows the attackers the ability to remotely perform different tasks like stealing data 

and dropping malicious tools. The attackers then use these tools to move laterally within the system, scan 

the environment, and prepare it for eventual BlackCat infection. 

Due to BlackCat’s sophistication as the first professional ransomware family to be written in Rust, a secure 

programming language that has concurrent processing capabilities, as well as its unique monetization 

method, extensive infrastructure, and wide array of supplementary tools in its attacks, it has the potential 

to become a staple in the RaaS scene in the foreseeable future.

Based on both our data and data from leak sites, we were able to note that these ransomware families 

are used mainly to target small businesses with up to 200 employees at most as well as medium\-sized 

businesses with up to 1,000 employees. The likely reason for this is that these types of organizations have 

less resources and a smaller workforce to properly deal with cyberattacks.32

2022 as opposed to the first half of 2021, lending more evidence to our assumption that malicious actors

about cybercriminals targeting ESXi. RansomEXX34, for example, has been exploiting ESXi vulnerabilities 

in its campaigns since at least 202135 — and it seems that other threat actors are now following suit.

In October 2021, LockBit’s operators announced a Linux\-based variant, LockBit Linux\-ESXi Locker 

version 1\.0, in an underground forum. This variant targets ESXi servers through a combination of Advanced 

Encryption Standard (AES) and elliptic\-curve cryptography (ECC) algorithms to encrypt data. Since then, 

samples of this variant have been found in the wild. 

In May 2022, a new ransomware variant named Cheerscrypt was also found targeting devices using ESXi.36 

Based on the source code of the Babuk ransomware that was leaked in September 2021,37 Cheerscrypt 

encrypts log files and other VMware\-related files using the double extortion technique. 

Although neither LockBit Linux\-ESXi Locker version 1\.0 nor Cheerscrypt deviates from the typical double 

extortion scheme used by many other ransomware variants, the potential impact of an infection is notable 

in this case since ESXi servers are widely used by enterprises for server virtualization. Organizations 

can also use these servers to host multiple virtual machines (VMs) where they keep important data. This 

means that they are often part of an organization’s critical infrastructure, and therefore any successful 

attack on these components can deal great damage to an organization.

Big Game\-Hunting Ransomware 
Families such as Black Basta and 
Nokoyawa Hit Organizations Across 
the Globe

We spotted ransomware operators setting their sights on businesses that have the capacity to pay sizeable 

ransom demands. Operators of the Black Basta ransomware38 struck hard and fast, hitting nearly 50 

organizations in a span of a couple of months in early 2022\.39 Black Basta originated in April 2022, when 

a user with the name Black Basta posted on some major underground forums that they were looking for 

corporate network access credentials for organizations in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, 

Australia, and New Zealand. The user also mentioned that they were offering a share of the profits to any 

potential partners. 

Currently, information on the scope and structure of the malicious actor’s operation is limited. Given Black 

Basta’s initial advertisement, however, it is likely that the group uses stolen credentials to gain access to 

its victim’s systems. It then proceeds to perform its encryption routine, first by deleting shadow copies via 

vssadmin.exe and then booting the device in safe mode. It then deletes the service called Fax, creates a 

new one using the malware’s path, and adds it to the registry for persistence. Finally, it shuts down and 

reboots the target’s machine in Safe Mode with Networking using the compromised service to encrypt 

files. One of the notable characteristics of Black Basta is that its ransom note is hard\-coded into the 

malware, suggesting that its operators could be using unique binaries for each of its victims.

Security researchers also pointed out connections between Black Basta and other ransomware and APT 

groups. A tweet from the MalwareHunterTeam described many similarities between Black Basta and 

Conti,40 while Trend Micro researchers managed to find correlations between Black Basta and QakBot.41

In the latter part of 2021, the Hive ransomware initiated a spate of attacks on the US healthcare sector, 

with some reports stating that over 300 organizations were hit in the ransomware’s first hundred days 

of operation.42 In 2022, we encountered Nokoyawa, a ransomware with several similarities to Hive.43 For 

example, these ransomware families share common tools and techniques, including the use of Cobalt 

Strike during the arrival phase of the attack and the integration of tools such as the anti\-rootkit scanners 

GMER and PC Hunter as part of defense evasion maneuvers. 

However, Hive and Nokoyawa also feature different characteristics, particularly in their code (they use 

different languages to compile the binary) and packing method: Hive variants are packed using UPX while 

Nokoyawa does not use any packer whatsoever.

Most of Nokoyawa’s targets were in the South American region, particularly in Argentina.

CVE\-2017\-14100,46 a critical\-severity vulnerability that could allow shell command injections if successfully 

exploited and affects certain versions of Asterisk, an open\-source software used to build communications 

applications, had the highest number of exploit detections in the first half of 2022 based on Trend Micro™ 

TippingPoint® Threat Protection System sensors. This was followed by the OpenSSL memory leak flaw 

CVE\-2014\-3567 and the IIS web server folder traversal vulnerability CVE\-2000\-0884, which had exploit 

detections of over 9 and 4 million, respectively. The presence of these older vulnerabilities (with exploit 

detections numbering in the millions in some cases) among the most exploited bugs in the first half of 

the year is evidence that many organizations still have difficulty implementing crucial updates to their 

software. Even worse, it might mean that many organizations still completely ignore such updates.

Meanwhile, CVE\-2022\-30190 (also known as Follina),47 a high\-severity remote code execution (RCE) 

vulnerability affecting Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT), has reportedly been used in 

attacks on high\-value targets in European countries and the US.48 Microsoft has since patched this flaw

2021 saw the rise of CVE\-2021\-44228 (also known as Log4Shell),50 a vulnerability that affected the Java\-

based logging library, Apache Log4j. The disclosure of Log4Shell shook the cybersecurity landscape due 

to the ubiquity of the software it affected and its integration into different systems, which made it difficult 

for organizations to determine how they were affected.51 The first half of 2022 saw more vulnerabilities 

affecting critical enterprise software, with perhaps the most notable being the Spring4Shell vulnerability.

On March 31, 2022, creators of the Spring Framework, a widespread open\-source Java framework 

commonly used in enterprise applications, published information on CVE\-2022\-22965,52 a critical zero\-

day vulnerability (colloquially known as Spring4Shell due to its similarities to Log4Shell) that affects a 

number of dependencies, such as setups that run on Spring Framework versions before 5\.2\.20, 5\.3\.18, 

and Java Development Kit (JDK) 9 and higher. 

The Spring4Shell vulnerability typically occurs when special objects or classes are exposed to certain 

conditions. Attackers that want to directly access an object can do so by specifying the class variable in 

their requests. In addition, access to the child properties of an object via class objects results in attackers 

being able to gain access to high\-value objects in the system by following the chains of properties.53

In February 2022, Trend Micro ZDI published a blog entry that detailed CVE\-2021\-44142,55 a vulnerability 

in Samba, the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix, specifically 

versions of Samba prior to 4\.13\.17\.56 CVE\-2021\-44142 exists within the parsing of EA metadata in the 

Samba server daemon (smbd) when opening a file. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability would thus be 

able to execute code in the root context even without authentication.

After an earlier version of an out\-of\-bounds (OOB) vulnerability in the Samba software was disclosed in 

Pwn2Own Austin 2021, ZDI conducted further research and discovered more variants of the bug, which 

they then disclosed to Samba’s developers. The company subsequently released a patch addressing 

CVE\-2021\-44142 and other vulnerabilities on January 31, 2022\.57

As a standard system service on nearly all Linux distributions, Samba is widely used. Patching CVE\-2021\-

44142 is therefore a must for organizations that use Linux\- and Unix\-based systems.

Data from Trend Micro™ Deep Security™ (DS) revealed some key insights on customer environments. 

Log4j\-related vulnerabilities (CVE\-2021\-4422858 and CVE\-2021\-4504659\) had high activity levels in the 

first half of the year, with over 5 billion combined events being detected and filtered by DS. Overall, 

CVE\-2017\-14495,60 a flaw affecting dnsmasq — a free software that can be configured as a DNS, a 

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), and a TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server — had the 

highest number of detected events, which is unsurprising given its popularity and importance to routers 

and IoT gateways.61

The large number of detected events associated with these vulnerabilities further confirms our observation 

that flaws affecting ubiquitous and essential software will remain a popular choice for exploitation by 

malicious actors.

Newly Discovered Vulnerabilities 
 Threaten the DDS Standard 

The Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard is an example of middleware technology that serves as 

the connectivity standard for enabling secure real\-time information exchange, modular application 

development, and rapid integration for the industrial internet of things (IIoT).62 DDS is used to implement a 

reliable communication layer between sensors, controllers, and actuators in areas such as transportation, 

robotics, telecommunications, healthcare, and defense, making it a critical type of middleware technology 

despite not being widely known to the public. 

In addition to the importance of DDS in the software supply chain, it’s also worth noting that its location 

at the beginning of the chain makes it easy to lose track of. As a result, malicious actors see DDS as an 

attractive target. Since it serves as a security\-critical building block of the system, the exploitation of a 

single vulnerability has the potential to leave an impact on the rest of the software stack. 

In January 2022, Trend Micro Research, TXOne Networks, and ZDI in collaboration with ADLINK Labs and 

Alias Robotics published an entry discussing DDS from a cybersecurity perspective. The entry included 

information on 13 new vulnerabilities for the six most common DDS implementations.63 These new bugs 

also affect Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2\), the default operating system for robotics and automation 

that uses DDS as middleware, meaning that the impact of each vulnerability could affect more than just 

DDS itself.

Figure 20\. The 13 new DDS vulnerabilities that were discovered via a collaboration between Trend 

Micro Research, TXOne Networks, and ZDI in partnership with ADLINK Labs and Alias Robotics; the 

vulnerabilities cover the network and configuration attack surfaces.

The DDS vulnerabilities can be divided into those that affect the network level and those that affect the 

configuration level. The former can be exploited to implement a variety of malicious techniques such as 

denial\-of\-service (DoS) attacks, spoofing, and automated collection, while the latter can be used to target 

DDS system developers and integrators.

To test how an actual attack might work, our researchers used the Gazebo simulator to create an 

environment using physics engines to mimic a real\-world scenario. Using this setup, we were able to 

simulate an attack on an autonomous driving platform, thereby crafting a scenario where a malicious 

actor can exploit CVE\-2021\-3844764 and CVE\-2021\-38445\.65 Upon exploitation, the ROS 2 nodes would 

either crash or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the system.

Notable Vulnerabilities Affecting 
Non\-Windows Operating Systems

Some of the noteworthy vulnerabilities we discovered and analyzed in the first half of 2022 affected 

platforms other than Windows. In April 2022, we released a blog entry about our discovery and analysis 

of CVE\-2022\-22639,66 a vulnerability in suhelperd, a helper daemon process for the macOS Software 

Update that contains the class SUHelper. This class is responsible for a critical system service via the 

inter\-process communication (IPC) mechanism. The successful exploitation of CVE\-2022\-22639 can lead 

to an attacker gaining root privileges that they can use for malicious attacks.67 Apple has since patched 

this bug via the macOS Monterey 12\.3 update released in March 2022\.68

There were also prominent vulnerabilities affecting Linux\- and Unix\-based operating systems. CVE\-2022\-

0847, also known as Dirty Pipe,69 is a bug that affects the Linux kernel from versions 5\.8 and up. It exploits 

a flaw in the Linux kernel’s memory management, specifically through how pipe page caches are merged 

and overwrite other page caches.70 Dirty Pipe, which can potentially allow the elevation of an attacker 

to root privileges on the host, is relatively easy to exploit. It is therefore vital for organizations to check 

whether they are using vulnerable versions of the Linux kernel. Upon learning that these are vulnerable, 

they must then update their systems according to Linux kernel versions 5\.16\.11, 5\.15\.25, and 5\.10\.102 

or later.71

On the other hand, CVE\-2022\-2946472 is a critical RCE vulnerability that affects several products from 

WSO2, a technology provider that offers open\-source platforms for integrating application programming 

interfaces (APIs), applications, and web services:

• WSO2 API Manager 2\.2\.0 and above

• 

• 

• 

Identity Server 5\.2\.0 and above

Identity Server Analytics 5\.4\.0 to 5\.6\.0

Identity Server as Key Manager 5\.3\.0 and above

• Open Banking AM 1\.4\.0 and above

• Enterprise Integrator 6\.2\.0 and above 

27 \| Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

Exploitation of this flaw, which does not require user interaction or administrative privileges, can allow 

attackers to infiltrate the networks of affected systems. 

Since April 2022, we have been seeing CVE\-2022\-29464 exploit attempts in the wild. These attempts 

occurred after a proof of concept for the exploit was published in GitHub.73 Shortly after this was posted, 

a Metasploit module for affected environments was made available.74 These exploit attempts involve the 

installation of Cobalt Strike beacons and other malware as part of the attack routine.75

As with the other vulnerabilities discussed in this section, we encourage organizations using affected 

WSO2 products to update their systems or apply the temporary mitigation recommendations as suggested 

by their respective security advisories.76 WSO2 has since released a patch addressing this vulnerability.77

Although cryptocurrency prices declined sharply during the first half of 2022,80 schemes built around

infrastructure and resources to mine cryptocurrencies. 

Traditionally, the most efficient method of cryptocurrency mining involved the use of expensive machines

profitable, but only at scale where sheer numbers can make up for the difference in performance. Since

29 \| Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

focusing their efforts on quantity over quality by relying instead on compromising cloud instances for 

cryptocurrency\-mining operations.81

In our research into cloud\-based cryptocurrency mining, we investigated the primary threat actors that 

inhabit this space and determined the five most prominent groups and how they conduct their operations:

Outlaw is a threat actor that prefers to stick to the tools and techniques it knows, with relatively little 

change in its operations over the years.82 Outlaw’s preferred targets include IoT devices and Linux cloud 

servers, which it compromises by exploiting known vulnerabilities or performing brute\-force Secure Shell 

(SSH) attacks.

TeamTNT is a group we’ve covered extensively over the past couple of years.83 The threat actor is known 

for being active in social media, going as far as replying to researchers who have analyzed their attacks. 

TeamTNT has evolved quickly over a short period, making it one of the most technically proficient threat 

actors focused on cryptocurrency mining. The group’s preferred modus operandi is to exploit vulnerable 

software to compromise hosts before performing credential theft as a precursor for lateral movement 

within the victim’s system and exploiting misconfigurations. 

Kinsing, at least in terms of online presence, can be considered an antithesis to TeamTNT since the group 

does not maintain any noticeable presence on social media or even in underground forums. However, it 

shares some similarities with its rival in terms of its ability to quickly adapt and evolve its operational 

kit.84 The group is also known for its quick adoption of new exploits, as seen in its use of the Log4Shell 

vulnerability just a few days after it was first made public.85

8220 is a group that has been a frequent exploiter of vulnerabilities, primarily those that affect Oracle 

WebLogic Server. After a relatively quiet 2020, we observed that the group became much more active in 

2021, with approximately 10 times the activity levels in the previous year. The threat actor has also been 

known to compete with Kinsing for the same resources, with the two often kicking each other out from 

compromised machines to install their own cryptocurrency miners.

Kek Security is a relatively new group that has been garnering attention due to its sophistication and 

penchant for integrating new exploits into its attacks. Kek Security is also continuously developing 

its malware, with some of its more recent additions providing better obfuscation capabilities to evade 

detection and prevent researcher analysis.

Given that all these groups are targeting both common and limited resources, we witnessed multiple 

instances where different threat actors fought over the same machines, often using kill scripts to deal with 

competitors. It is this cutthroat competition that drives a large portion of the innovations implemented by 

the various threat actors. Primarily, these innovations involve adding capabilities that would allow them to 

target systems that their adversaries cannot. 

Malicious Actors Abuse Cloud 
 Tunneling Services for Cloud\-Based 
Attacks

Some of the advantages that cloud technologies provide can likewise present security challenges for 

organizations. For example, the cloud’s ability to swiftly deploy assets and services helps organizations be 

more efficient; however, it can also prevent them from having full visibility over deployed assets. Attackers 

can take advantage of this by launching attacks using more unconventional methods in places that IT 

teams and security staff are less likely to monitor.

We recently observed malicious actors abusing cloud tunnels, a service used by both individuals and 

businesses to expose their internal systems to the internet by relaying traffic through cloud\-based 

infrastructure. In enterprise settings, these kinds of services are used by developers to test and deploy 

code, as well as to make certain services available to select users on the internet. In other words, cloud 

tunneling serves as a convenient tool that allows users to deploy local development services without 

needing to configure network firewalls and register domain names. 

Due to its growing popularity, cloud tunneling services have become a prime target for malicious actors 

looking to expand their operations. Groups that employ cloud tunneling services normally use them for 

transitory purposes so that they will not need to maintain permanent infrastructures, as well as to add 

another layer of secrecy by masking their real locations.86

Cloud tunneling threats can be categorized into two distinct types: internal threats and external threats. 

Internal threats refer to attacks where the service is used (either purposefully or unknowingly) to expose 

internal services such as Server Message Block (SMB), FTP, and HTTP. On the other hand, external 

threats involve traditional attacks and routines such as phishing and C\&C communication via the cloud 

tunnel.

In one blog entry in September 2020, we discuss an instance where an insider attack involved the abuse 

of legitimate tools and services. In particular, a malicious actor used ngrok to expose an SMB port, 

eventually leading to the download and execution of a keylogger.87 In contrast, external attacks are more 

common and usually involve operations that integrate cloud tunneling services for the routing of malware 

traffic or the hosting of phishing websites.

Cloud Misconfiguration Remains an 
Issue for Organizations

The growth of the container market, which is estimated to reach US$8\.2 billion by 2025, has made it 

an appealing target for cloud\-focused threat actors.88 While containers can provide organizations an 

increase in the speed and efficiency of their development cycles, failure to implement proper security 

controls could result in compromise at various stages of the pipeline, from hijacked repositories to the 

exploitation of weaknesses in specific components of the container software.89

Misconfigured container software remains a significant issue for many organizations. According to a 

survey from Red Hat encompassing over 300 DevOps, engineering, and security professionals, 53% of 

the respondents detected a misconfiguration in their container and/or Kubernetes deployment.90

We investigated one of the primary misconfiguration issues in Kubernetes deployments, specifically 

Kubernetes clusters that are publicly exposed via port 10250\.91 The kubelet is an integral part of Kubernetes, 

and it is responsible for ensuring that all containers are running in a pod and performing functions, such 

as helping nodes join the Kubernetes cluster, managing the health of containers, and keeping the control 

updated on node information. Port 10250, which is used by the kubelet API, is typically inaccessible to 

external services as it is exposed internally. 

However, based on Shodan data, we were able to use IP address information and a simple script to 

send requests to the kubelet API to identify over 240,000 exposed Kubernetes cluster nodes. Although 

a significant number of these nodes returned HTTP “401 Status Code – Unauthorized,” meaning that 

they were blocking anonymous requests, a skilled malicious actor can still compromise the kubelet 

authentication token or use other exploits, thereby endangering the clusters. Approximately 600 nodes 

returned the “200 – OK” notification, resulting in some nodes that are running a kubelet providing 

information on pods in that specific node. For these exposed nodes, an attacker can install and run 

programs via the kubelet API.

Meanwhile, Trend Micro Cloud One™ Conformity data shows the tools and services with the highest 

levels of service misconfiguration rates (based on total checks) from Amazon Web Services (AWS), 

Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In particular, Azure’s activity log service had high 

misconfiguration rates and was associated with a high number of high\-risk rules (based on Conformity 

risk level rating).

 The Evolving Attack Surface 
Requires Effective Multilayered 
Defenses and Security 
 Technologies 

If there is anything we can glean from the current state of cybersecurity, it’s that the growth of the digital 

attack surface has organizations scrambling to fill as many security gaps as they can. After two years of 

remote work, some employees have started to shift back in some capacity to their on\-site workplaces, 

while others have adopted a hybrid arrangement. These varying configurations in working environments, 

together with the growing number of technologies that are being integrated into business operations, are 

a call for organizations to allocate additional resources to cover as much of the attack surface as possible.

Over time, threat actors have become more dangerous, launching attacks that have grown in both scale 

and sophistication. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that threat actors now exploit multiple sections of 

the attack surface in a single campaign: After all, the rising popularity of service\-based malware has made 

it easier for cybercriminals to launch attacks and for malware developers to hide their tracks. 

The evolution of ransomware from the more innocuous attacks of yesteryear to the double — and even 

triple — extortion schemes of today means that defending systems against modern ransomware families 

cannot be viewed as anything less than top priority. In the same vein, widespread technologies such 

as cloud services, where organizations do not physically control the infrastructure, must still rely on the 

shared responsibility model for effective security.92

The first step in attack surface management (ASM) is the discovery of the attack surface itself, where 

organizations examine their assets and determine elements such as the critical importance of an asset, 

any potential vulnerabilities, the level of threat activity, and how much threat intelligence is being gathered 

from their assets. Assessing available security controls and how they offset risks is also an important 

preliminary step in planning an organization’s ASM.

35 \| Defending the Expanding Attack Surface: Trend Micro 2022 Midyear Cybersecurity Report

One integral component of ASM is visibility, as it provides valuable information on potential threats. In 

turn, this can help enterprises determine their risk exposure and allow them to take the necessary steps 

to mitigate these risks.93

Proper security protocols and best practices go a long way toward helping businesses protect their system 

from attacks. Organizations should prioritize updating their software as soon as possible to minimize the 

chance of attackers successfully exploiting vulnerabilities in their system. Other options, such as virtual 

patching, can help organizations protect their machines while they wait for vendors to provide security 

updates. Cloud users, meanwhile, should ensure that their cloud infrastructure is set up properly with 

appropriate security protocols in place to prevent attackers from capitalizing on misconfigurations. User 

education is also a key part of a successful security posture since end users often serve as the weakest 

links that malicious actors try to exploit to gain access to other parts of an organization’s system.

However, the complex reality of securing infrastructure, systems, and endpoints means that even with 

these in place, securing each possible point of attack would still be challenging without the right security 

tools in place.

While there are technologies that can individually handle security for different parts of a system, these 

also come with their own drawbacks, such as the inability to correlate different data points from each 

siloed source. Security teams are thus limited to working with only pieces of the puzzle at a time when 

trying to determine how an attack happened and where it came from. 

A single platform that can cover the entire attack surface is the ideal solution for organizations, especially 

those with limited resources. With a comprehensive platform, organizations stand to gain complete 

visibility over their attack surface, not to mention the ability to correlate different indicators so that they 

can focus on the bigger picture. A unified security platform can also provide multilayered protection while 

helping reduce expenditures that would otherwise be spent on multiple security technologies.94 Lastly, to 

minimize potential security gaps, this platform must be configurable and capable of providing continuous 

protection of digital assets to minimize potential security gaps.

addition to improvements in the Smart Protection Network’s feedback mechanism during this period, we 

believe that both the pandemic and the shift to remote and hybrid work setups also contributed to this 

growth in detections.

One of the noteworthy incidents involving IoT platforms occurred when a variant of a modular botnet 

called Cyclops Blink, previously linked to the Sandworm APT group,97 was found to have targeted Asus 

routers using a specially designed module that can access an infected device’s flash memory, which 

allowed it to retrieve information and even survive system resets.98 Although Cyclops Blink, which had 

previously attempted to launch attacks on WatchGuard Firebox,99 is regarded as a state\-sponsored 

botnet, our research revealed that the targeted devices were not necessarily part of critical infrastructure 

or industries. It is therefore likely that the attempted attacks on Asus routers were part of its operator’s 

attempts to expand its infrastructure for future attacks on higher\-value targets. Asus has since released a 

security bulletin that offers firmware updates for affected devices.100

Upon looking at trends in recent years, we have observed a steady dip in cryptocurrency miner detections, 

which peaked in 2018\. The first half of 2022, for example, saw a noticeable decrease from the previous 

two half\-years. One possible reason for this dip is the crash in cryptocurrency prices midyear due to 

various external issues.101 It is likely that this led to cybercriminals’ reduced interest in cryptocurrency\-

mining schemes.

We observed certain cryptocurrency malware\-related trends during the first half of 2022\.102 For example, 

the rise of new technologies such as non\-fungible tokens (NFTs) has made them prime targets for 

scammers. Some of the scams we observed involving NFTs include using fake NFT trader domains that

are designed to trick users into connecting their wallets to fraudulent sites to open the way for further 

attacks. We also found examples of NFTs with phishing links in the description being airdropped to 

unwary users — again to trick them into connecting their wallets. 

Another trend we recently spotted is the use of Telegram as an avenue for launching cryptocurrency 

scams. In one scenario, malicious actors disguised themselves as technical support representatives in 

a chat group, offering to help cryptocurrency users with their concerns. These fake representatives then 

tried to convince the victim to visit phishing sites that are designed to steal mnemonic seed phrases — a 

series of unrelated words that are generated when a cryptocurrency wallet is created — and private keys. 

We also discovered similar scenarios involving Telegram chat groups, where the group owners pretended 

to be legitimate chat group administrators to trick users interested in cryptocurrencies into visiting scam 

web pages.

Our data shows a slight decrease (4\.9%) in mobile device\-related malicious samples in the first half of 

2022 as opposed to the first half of 2021\.

As for notable mobile malware\-related incidents, we discovered malicious actors publishing fake mobile 

apps disguised as cryptocurrency\-mining software designed to lure users into either subscribing for paid 

services or selecting ads offering phony cryptocurrency earnings.103 Upon further analysis, we found that 

one of these apps loaded a bogus website asking users to enter their private keys and mnemonic phrases, 

which would then be collected for future use.
