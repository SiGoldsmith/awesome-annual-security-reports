# Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark Study
## Privacy Becomes Mission Critical

[TOC]

## Introduction
Over the past few years, privacy has become mission critical for organizations around the world. More than two-thirds of countries have enacted privacy laws, customers are not buying from organizations who don’t protect their data, and privacy metrics are regularly being reported to Boards of Directors. In addition, privacy skills are becoming more important, especially among security professionals, and organizations are benefitting financially from their investments in privacy. This report, our fifth annual review of key privacy issues for organizations, examines privacy’s impact on business around the world.

## Key Takeaways
From the Report Include:

1.  Privacy has become essential to organizations’ culture and business practices, including their buying processes, management metrics, and employee areas of responsibility.
2.  Privacy’s Return on Investment (ROI) remains high for the third straight year, with increased benefits, especially for small-to medium-size organizations and higher ROI for more privacy-mature organizations.
3.  Most organizations recognize their responsibility to treat data ethically, but many customers want more transparency and are concerned about the use of data particularly in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automated decision making.
4.  Data localization requirements are seen as important but costly.
5.  Aligning privacy with security seems to create financial and maturity advantages, compared to other organizational models.

## Methodology
The data in this study is derived from the Cisco Security Outcomes survey, in which respondents were anonymous to the researchers and not informed who was conducting the study. Using the same methodology as prior years, more than 5300 security professionals from 27 geographies<sup>1</sup> completed the survey in Summer 2021. Survey respondents represent all major industries and a mix of company sizes (See Appendix 1). We directed privacy specific questions to the more than 4900 respondents who indicated they are familiar with the privacy processes at their organizations. In this report, we also have included relevant results from the Cisco 2021 Consumer Privacy Survey, which was completed in Summer 2021 by 2600 adults in 12 countries<sup>2</sup>.

<sup>1</sup> Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Columbia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, The Netherlands, UK, US, and Vietnam.

## 1. Privacy Becomes Mission Critical
Privacy has become a business imperative and a critical component of customer trust for organizations around the world. For the second year in a row, 90% of the respondents in our global survey said they would not buy from an organization that does not properly protect its data, and 91% indicated that external privacy certifications are important in their buying process. The COVID-19 pandemic further strengthened privacy’s role, as 91% of organizations said their privacy teams have helped them deal with the many complex workforce personal data issues that have arisen in the past few years. Perhaps it is not surprising then that 92% of organizations said that respecting privacy is integral to their culture. See Figure 1.

### Strongly Favorable View of Privacy Laws
Privacy legislation continues to be very well received around the world. These laws play an important role in providing assurances that governments and organizations are being held accountable for how they manage personal data, and over two-thirds (128 of 194) of countries now have privacy laws in place<sup>1</sup>. Even though complying with these laws often involves significant effort and cost (e.g., cataloging data, maintaining records of processing activities, implementing controls – privacy by design, responding to user requests), organizations recognize the positive impact on their organizations. Eighty-three percent of all corporate respondents said privacy laws have had a positive impact, 14% were neutral,

<sup>1</sup> United Nations Conference on Trade and Development

and only 3% indicated the laws have had a negative impact. Despite the additional complexity brought on by more legislation over the past year, this result is even more positive than in last year’s survey (where respondents were 79% positive, 7% negative). Also noteworthy is how strong this is across the world. Many geographies, including Philippines, Mexico, Thailand, Indonesia, China, and Vietnam, had 90% or more of respondents saying privacy regulation has had a positive impact, and every geography in our survey had at least two-thirds of respondents indicating the same. See Figure 2. As discussed in our previous reports, both consumers and organizations expect and value a strong governmental role in protecting privacy. The regulations can provide a more consistent standard of care, greater clarity on the rights and recourses of data owners, and guidelines as to what data processing activities are permitted or prohibited.

**Figure 2. Impact of Privacy Laws, by Geography**

*Image Description: A bar chart showing the impact of privacy laws by geography. Each geography has two bars, one representing the percentage of respondents saying privacy laws have a positive impact, and the other representing the percentage of respondents saying privacy laws have a negative impact. The geographies are listed on the vertical axis, and the percentages are on the horizontal axis. The source is cited as "Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark Study".*

### Vast Majority are Reporting Privacy Metrics to their Board of Directors
An important indication of privacy’s importance to the organization is the use of privacy metrics, especially when they are reported to executive management and the Board of Directors. Among the organizations in this year’s survey, 94% are reporting one or more privacy-related metrics to the Board. While some are reporting as many as 10 privacy metrics, most are reporting between 1 and 3, with the overall average 2.6. The most reported metrics include Privacy Program Audit findings (34%), Personal Data Breaches (33%), and the results of Privacy Impact Assessments (32%). See Figure 3.

**Figure 3. Privacy Metrics Reported to Board of Directors**

*Image Description: A bar chart showing the percentage of organizations reporting various privacy metrics to their board of directors. The metrics are listed on the vertical axis, and the percentages are on the horizontal axis. The source is cited as "Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark Study".*

| Metric                   | Percentage |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Value or ROI             | 17%        |

| Audits                   | 34%        |

### Privacy is a Core Area of Responsibility for Security Professionals
Privacy skills have become increasingly critical, especially among those who are directly responsible for keeping data safe. The security professionals who completed our survey were asked to define their top 3 areas of responsibility. “Data Privacy and Governance” was selected by 32% of these respondents, making it second only to “Detecting and Responding to Threats” and just ahead of “Assessing and Managing Risk”. See Figure 4. Data privacy has become a core competency for these security teams, and integrating privacy skills can help ensure that those who are authorized to access data will handle it appropriately.

**Figure 4. Primary Areas of Responsibility among Security Professionals (could choose up to 3)**

*Image Description: A bar chart showing the percentage of security professionals who identified various areas as their primary responsibility. The areas are listed on the vertical axis, and the percentages are on the horizontal axis. The source is cited as "Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark Study".*

| Area                               | Percentage |
|------------------------------------|------------|
| Defining policies                  | 19%        |
| Auditing                           | 18%        |
| User support/training              | 17%        |
| Managing Vendors                   | 17%        |
| Infrastructure                     | 21%        |
| Software                           | 21%        |
| Managing Security Projects         | 22%        |
| Security Leadership                | 27%        |
| Assessing and Managing Risk        | 30%        |
| Data Privacy                       | 32%        |
| Detecting and Responding to Threats | 33%        |

Interestingly, several Asia-Pacific geographies had the highest percentage of respondents where privacy was identified as an area of responsibility, i.e., Indonesia (45%), Vietnam (43%), India (43%), and Malaysia (42%). The lowest percentages were in Chile (19%), France (22%), Columbia (23%), and the UK (24%). See Figure 5. The differences may reflect stronger integration between security and privacy in many countries in Asia-Pacific. It may also be due to organizations in countries with longer-standing privacy regimes assigning privacy responsibilities to areas other than the Security function, but more research will be needed on this issue.

| Vietnam         | 43%        |

## 2. Privacy Investment and Benefits
As privacy becomes more integrated into organizational priorities, investment continues to rise. The average privacy budget was up 13% from $2.4 Million last year to $2.7 Million this year. Spending at smaller organizations of 50-249 employees increased from $1.1 Million to $1.7 Million, and those with 250-499 employees increased from $1.6 Million to $2.1 Million. Meanwhile, the largest organizations (10,000+ employees) saw a slight decrease in spending from $3.7 Million to $3.5 Million this year after a steep increase last year. See Figure 6. In future research, we will explore where the spending growth is coming from, be it headcount, technology, or outside counsel.

**Figure 6. Privacy Spending, By Organization Size**

*Image Description: A line chart showing privacy spending by organization size over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. The organization sizes are on the horizontal axis, and the spending in millions of dollars is on the vertical axis. The source is cited as "Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark Study". Note: 50-249 category initiated in 2020.*

| Size (Number of Employees) | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  |
|----------------------------|-------|-------|-------|
| 50-249                     | N/A   | 1.1   | 1.7   |
| 250-499                    | 0.8   | 1.6   | 2.1   |
| 500-999                    | 1.2   | 2.0   | 2.3   |
| 1,000-9,999                | 1.3   | 2.8   | 3.0   |
| 10,000+                    | 1.9   | 3.7   | 3.5   |
| Overall                    | 1.2   | 2.4   | 2.7   |

The business value associated with these investments remains high. Ninety percent of all respondents said they consider privacy a business imperative. More specifically, we asked respondents about the potential benefits in 6 areas: reducing sales delays, mitigating losses from data breaches, enabling innovation, achieving operational efficiency, building trust with customers, and making their company more attractive. For each of these six areas, greater than 60% of respondents felt they were getting significant or very significant benefits, and this measure has been broadly consistent for the past two years. See Figure 7.

**Figure 7. Percentage Getting Significant Benefits in Each Area**

*Image Description: A bar chart showing the percentage of respondents who reported getting significant benefits in various areas due to their privacy investments. The areas are listed on the vertical axis, and the percentages are on the horizontal axis. The source is cited as "Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark Study".*

| Area                      | Percentage |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Reducing Sales Delays     | 63%        |
| Mitigating Security Losses | 68%        |
| Agility and Innovation    | 68%        |
| Operational Efficiency    | 68%        |
| More Attractive Company   | 69%        |
| Loyalty and Trust         | 71%        |

Respondents were also asked to estimate the financial value of the benefits from their privacy investments, and the average estimate was up 3% from $2.9 Million last year to $3.0 Million this year. Interestingly, the smaller organizations saw the largest percentage increases this year. Those with 50-249 employees increased from $1.1 Million to $2.0 Million, and those with 250-499 employees increased from $1.9 Million to $2.5 Million. Benefits at organizations with 1000-9999 employees remained constant at $3.4 Million and at the largest organizations with more than 10,000 employees, benefits fell slightly from $4.0 Million to $3.8 Million. See Figure 8.

The organization sizes are on the horizontal axis, and the benefits in millions of dollars are on the vertical axis. The source is cited as "Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark Study". Note: 50-249 category initiated in 2020.*

| Size (Number of Employees) | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  |
|----------------------------|-------|-------|-------|
| 50-249                     | N/A   | 1.1   | 2.0   |
| 250-499                    | 1.8   | 1.9   | 2.5   |
| 500-999                    | 2.3   | 2.5   | 2.8   |
| 1,000-9,999                | 2.9   | 3.4   | 3.4   |
| 10,000+                    | 4.1   | 4.0   | 3.8   |
| Overall                    | 2.7   | 2.9   | 3.0   |

### ROI Declines Slightly, but Remains Strong
From a return-on-investment perspective, the average organization estimated benefits at 1.8 times spending, which is down from 1.9 in last year’s survey. We believe this is due to ongoing needs in responding to the pandemic, adapting to new legislation, uncertainly over international data transfers, and increasing requirements for data localization (see below). Nonetheless, most organizations continue to get a very attractive return on their privacy investments. Thirty-two percent of organizations are getting benefits at least 2x spend, and only 19% are estimating they are not breaking even on their privacy investments. See Figure 9.

**Figure 9. Ratio of Privacy Benefits to Investment**

*Image Description: A pie chart showing the distribution of the ratio of privacy benefits to investment. The chart is divided into five segments, each representing a different range of the ratio. The source is cited as "Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark Study".*

| Ratio Range   | Percentage |
|---------------|------------|
| Below 1x      | 19%        |
| 1x to <2x     | 49%        |
| 2x to <3x     | 18%        |
| 3x to <5x     | 7%         |
| 5x and above  | 7%         |

### Returns Higher for More Mature Organizations and Where Privacy is Integrated with Security
It is also interesting to note the correlations between return and other factors like privacy maturity. Respondents who felt their privacy program was behind that of their peers were getting a lower return than those who felt they were the same or ahead of their peers. Specifically, the least mature had an average return of 1.53, compared to an average return of 1.97 for the most mature. This further demonstrates the value of privacy investment, as the most mature organizations are also realizing the greatest returns. See Figure 10.

**Figure 10. Estimated Returns (Benefits divided by spending)**

*Image Description: A bar chart showing the estimated returns (benefits divided by spending) based on the privacy maturity of the organization. The privacy maturity levels are listed on the horizontal axis, and the estimated returns are on the vertical axis. The source is cited as "Cisco 2022 Data Privacy Benchmark Study".*

| Privacy Maturity        | Estimated Return |
|-------------------------|------------------|
| Significantly behind peers | 1.53             |
| Somewhat behind peers    | 1.56             |
| About same as peers      | 1.92             |
| Somewhat ahead of peers  | 1.95             |
| Significantly ahead of peers | 1.97             |

Another relevant correlation was between the privacy return and whether the respondent identified privacy as a core responsibility of their job as security professionals. Organizations where the respondent identified privacy as a responsibility had an average return of almost 2x compared with 1.71x where the respondent did not identify privacy. This result suggests there is business value with having privacy and security working hand in hand.

## 3. Data Ethics and Automated Decision Making
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automated decision-making raise particular challenges for organizations and consumers regarding the use of personal data. Ninety-two percent of survey respondents recognize that their organization has a responsibility to only use data in an ethical manner. And nearly as many (87%) believe they already have processes in place to ensure automated decision-making is done in accordance with customer expectations. Consumers do not agree. Drawing on results from the Cisco 2021 Consumer Privacy Survey, nearly half (46%) of consumers feel they cannot adequately protect their data, and the primary reason is that they don’t understand exactly what organizations are collecting and doing with their data. See Figure 11.

**Figure 11. Ability of Consumers to Protect Their Data**

*Image Description: A graphic with two pie charts and a bar chart. The first pie chart shows the percentage of consumers who feel they can effectively protect their data (76%) and those who feel they cannot (46%). The second pie chart shows the reasons why consumers feel they cannot protect their data. The source is cited as "Cisco Consumer Privacy Study - 2021".*

Consumers value transparency when it comes to how their data is used, and decision-making with AI can be particularly difficult to explain. In fact, 56% of survey respondents expressed concerns about how businesses are using AI today. What’s more, when asked about using personal data in a number of typical AI use cases (e.g., selection of a sales representative, setting prices, determining credit worthiness), a large percentage, ranging from 37% to 55%, said that they would trust a company less that used AI for these decisions. See Figure 12. Organizations need to do more to ensure customers understand how their data is being used and built trust. This will likely be a significant challenge with respect to AI-based decisions.
