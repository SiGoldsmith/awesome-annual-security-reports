## Survey Method

The research was conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of NortonLifeLock among 10,003 adults aged 18+ in 10 countries. The survey was conducted November 15 - December 7, 2021 in Australia (n=1,002), Brazil (n=1,000), France (n=1,001), Germany (n=1,000), India (n=1,000), Italy (n=1,000), Japan (n=1,000), New Zealand (n=1,000), the United Kingdom (n=1,000), and the United States (n=1,000). Data are weighted where necessary to bring them in line with their actual proportions in the population; India was weighted to the population of those who are online. Weighted variables varied by country and included one or more of the following: age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, education, marital status, internet usage, household size, household income, urbanicity, and propensity to be online. A global post weight was applied to ensure equal weight of each country in the global total.

Throughout the report, references to YOY changes represent differences in results from the 2021 Global NLCSIR Study, conducted online by the Harris Poll on behalf of NortonLifeLock among 10,030 adults aged 18+ in 10 countries from February 15-28, 2021.

Population projection estimates cited are calculated based on adult population (age 18+) figures from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2022 International Data Base, Pew Research Center 2017 Global Attitudes Survey and IBGE Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística PNAD 2018 Internet Users. No estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.
