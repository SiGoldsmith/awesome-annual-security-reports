Global Results
January 2022
Prepared By:
Copyright © 2021 NortonLifeLock Inc. All rights reserved.
The research was conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of 
NortonLifeLock among 10,003 adults aged 18+ in 10 countries. The 
survey was conducted November 15 - December 7, 2021 in Australia 
(n=1,002), Brazil (n=1,000), France (n=1,001), Germany (n=1,000), 
India (n=1,000), Italy (n=1,000), Japan (n=1,000), New Zealand 
(n=1,000), the United Kingdom (n=1,000), and the United States 
(n=1,000). Data are weighted where necessary to bring them in line 
with their actual proportions in the population; India was weighted to 
the population of those who are online. Weighted variables varied by 
country and included one or more of the following: age, gender, 
race/ethnicity, region, education, marital status, internet usage, 
household size, household income, urbanicity, and propensity to be 
online. A global post weight was applied to ensure equal weight of 
each country in the global total. 
Throughout the report, references to YOY changes represent 
differences in results from the 2021 Global NLCSIR Study, conducted 
online by the Harris Poll on behalf of NortonLifeLock among 10,030 
adults aged 18+ in 10 countries from February 15-28, 2021. 
Population projection estimates cited are calculated based on adult 
population (age 18+) figures from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2022 
International Data Base, Pew Research Center 2017 Global Attitudes 
Survey and IBGE Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística PNAD 
2018 Internet Users. No estimates of theoretical sampling error can be 
calculated.
