2021, the number of CEOs who said cybersecurity risks

woes in 2021 affected 

everything from healthcare, 

the automotive industry and 

cybersecurity to travel, retail 

and the food supply. 

The growing pains of the new work reality were evident as 

companies opting for a permanent shift to fully remote 

work often found their networks, employees and processes 

unprepared for the change. Many businesses that stayed 

with the traditional work model continued to make 

arrangements for employees to return to the office, only to 

This has translated to increased funding: Global 

cybersecurity spending was projected to grow 12\.4% by the 

end of 2021, twice as fast as in 2020\.

At the government level, at least 45 U.S. states considered 

cybersecurity bills in 2021, up 18% from 2020\. And the U.S., 

Japan, Australia, Germany and countless others passed 

measures strengthening national cybersecurity.

But perhaps most remarkable is the level of cooperation 2021 

brought. Governments are increasingly coordinating with 

business and education leaders on “whole\-of\-nation” efforts.

But while some may see these challenges and default to 

pessimism, doing so requires an impossibly narrow view of 

the preceding year — one which doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.

When I look back on 2021, I’m amazed at what was

notched some battles this past year, in the end they 

spurred us on. If they want to win, they’ll have to take on all 

of us, together.

This issue continued to be debated in the courts throughout 

2021, but on the battlefields of business networks around the 

world, cybercriminals were launching a full\-bore offensive.

Ransomware climbed an unprecedented 105% in 2021, 

and the explosive growth of strategies such as double and 

even triple extortion ensured that these attacks were more 

successful than ever. But as cybercriminals have grown

Supply Chain

Supply\-Chain Attacks 
Continue In 2021

In December 2020, American company SolarWinds 

Codecov – April 15, 2021

confirmed that a version of its Orion product had been 

targeted via the company’s supply chain, kicking off a new 

era in supply\-chain attacks.

In April, software company Codecov became aware that 

attackers had compromised an uploader designed to 

deliver coverage data and product updates. This attack

wasn’t until NotPetya’s spread in 2017 that people really 

started to understand the widespread devastation that 

supply\-chain attacks could wreak.

Five years later, a new crop of supply\-chain attacks made 

their mark across 2021 — many not just threatening profits 

and business continuity, but striking directly at our daily lives. 

Here are some of the year’s worst:

Kaseya – July 2, 2021

Just before the U.S. July 4 holiday, a massive ransomware 

campaign then called the “single biggest ransomware attack 

yet” came to light. By gaining access to American software 

company Kaseya’s VSA remote management and monitoring 

software, ransomware group REvil was able to impact 

Managed Service Providers (MSPs), and in turn, gain access

17 countries were affected.

file\-transfer program. The first two, exploited in December 

2020, were quickly patched — but unbeknownst to Accellion 

at the time, two additional CVEs were being exploited 

through January. The attack spread to as many as 100 

of Accellion’s customers via the impacted FTA server. 

The hackers stole large quantities of sensitive personal 

information, which the Cl0p ransomware gang used to extort 

payment from the victims.

In July, 11 Python packages hosted on open\-source 

repository PyPI, the official third\-party software repository 

for Python, were found to contain malicious code. Due to 

the fact that the malware packages were remarkably well 

hidden, the packages remained undetected for long enough 

to be downloaded over 41,000 times by developers from 

other organizations. These malicious files then stole Discord 

authentication tokens, scraped sensitive autocomplete data, 

Perhaps as remarkable as the breach itself is the fact that

it didn’t happen sooner: The FTA server in question was a 

name, license key information and more.

20\-year\-old legacy product that advertised itself as a way to 

securely transfer sensitive files, and the fact that it has long 

been utilized by major players in governments, the insurance 

industry and the financial sector means it’s likely been an 

attractive target for a long time.

The Log4j Vulnerability

While the Apache Log4j vulnerability was the final major 

vulnerability identified in 2021, it quicky became one of the 

most exploited. From Dec. 11 to Jan. 31, SonicWall recorded 

142\.4 million exploit attempts against Log4j vulnerabilities — 

an average of 2\.7 million each day.

What’s remarkable, though, is how quickly hackers and 

cyber threat actors pivoted to exploit these vulnerabilities. 

It took less than 48 hours from the initial Dec. 9 PoC public 

What are the Log4j Vulnerabilities?
The vulnerabilities affect Log4j, an extremely popular Full 

Open\-Source Software (FOSS) logging library with two 

primary branches: 1\.x and 2\.x, the former of which is at 

end\-of\-life. The primary vulnerabilities are tracked via 

CVE\-2021\-44228, CVE\-2021\-45046 and CVE\-2021\-45105\.

Based on Google’s Open Source Insight Team’s examination, 

Log4j was identified as a ubiquitous dependency across

The first and most critical vulnerability among the suite, 

CVE\-2021\-44228, was initially referred to as “Log4shell,” a

the foreseeable future.

While keeping up the cadence of patches for these 

vulnerabilities will pose a challenge, the real struggle will be in 

identifying impacted frontends, middleware, backends, desktop 

apps, off\-the\-shelf software and software created in house.

Who’s Affected?
The rate of exploit makes it difficult for 

patch development to keep up. But 

even when it can, it isn’t a panacea: 

Patching hygiene is enough of a 

challenge in perfect conditions. But 

because this vulnerability affects 

millions of consumer and business 

products — everything from the 

Minecraft video game to the Mars 

2020 helicopter mission Ingenuity — 

getting everyone to care enough to 

patch even once is an uphill battle, 

to put it mildly.

Even so, it wouldn’t be enough. 

Stores and warehouses are full of 

products packaged with Log4j that 

will become vulnerable the minute 

they come online, and some legacy 

products are no longer receiving 

updates at all, including some critical 

healthcare systems.

What are the Dangers?
Because this vulnerability is 

due to improper handling of 

logged messages, any remote, 

unauthenticated attacker who can 

control log message contents can 

exploit the vulnerability. This can be 

done by sending a specially crafted 

parameter to the target application. 

From there, attackers can break into

Log4j’s Legal Implications
For those ignoring their patching responsibilities, the 

consequences stretch far beyond the possibility of 

cyberattack. On January 4, 2022, the U.S. Federal Trade 

Commission issued guidance stating that that failure to 

take reasonable mitigation steps “implicates laws including, 

among others, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the 

Gramm Leach Bliley Act.” 

Citing the Equifax breach of 2017 — and the $575 million 

settlement that resulted from the company’s failure to 

patch — the Commission warned that it “intends to use its 

full legal authority to pursue companies that fail to take 

responsible steps to protect consumer data from exposure 

as a result of Log4j.”

Such strategies must include integrating actionable 

threat intelligence to enhance visibility on supply\-chain 

vulnerabilities across the code base and production 

environment, allowing security teams the opportunity to 

automate identification of CWEs and CVEs and orchestrate 

remediation across technology stacks.

These measures become increasingly crucial as 

supply\-chain attacks increase, amplifying the impact of 

vulnerabilities, as we’ve seen with Log4j, Urgent/11, Ripple20, 

DNSpooq and Amnesia:33\.

To reduce risk, an effort should be made to not only ensure 

visibility of dependencies and third\-party code in your own 

technology stack, but also that of your vendors.

BEC Attacks are Big Business
While simple, these attacks are both highly sophisticated

roughly $1\.8 billion dollars in 2020 — and this is just from the 

attacks they were aware of.

Osterman’s research estimates that 80% of organizations 

were targeted by at least one BEC attack in 2021\. Mid\-sized 

organizations, those with 500 to 2,500 email users, were 

even more likely to experience an attack: Nearly nine out of 

10 saw an attack last year. 

And these attacks are often successful. Nearly 60% 

of organizations surveyed reported being victims of a 

successful or almost successful BEC attack.

Roughly 40% of organizations said they had no BEC attacks 

that fell into these categories. But as these attacks become 

more common, organizations are becoming increasingly 

aware that they can no longer count on not being targeted as

increases projected in the short term.

At the same time, respondents also said they lacked 

confidence in their existing protections and were unsure

insurance providers or law enforcement, or prevent these 

attacks from getting to highly targeted users in the first place.

Malware May Be 
Headed for a Rebound

Total malware continued to drop in 2021, falling 4%

year\-over\-year to 5\.4 billion hits, according to SonicWall 

year over year.)

Capture Labs threat data. This represents both the third\-

straight year of decrease, as well as a seven\-year low — but a 

closer look at the data shows this trend may be shifting.

A year\-over\-year decrease in malware is always good news. 

But keep in mind that yearly data is often the last place that 

trends appear. Think of ripples in a pond: the small areas (in 

this case, monthly or quarterly totals) are affected before the 

larger areas. And, unfortunately, a more detailed look at the 

2021 data reveals a number of warning signs.

Since 2019, malware volume has been falling globally, from 

5\.1 billion in the second half in that year, to 3\.2 billion in the 

first half of 2020, to 2\.4 billion in the second half of 2020\.

But in June 2021, SonicWall Capture Labs threat researchers 

noted that malware in the first half of the year had gone 

Unfortunately, the full\-year data revealed this wasn’t an 

anomaly. In the second half of 2021, malware rose even 

higher, reaching 2\.9 billion.

In other words, while yearly data is still indicating a 

downward trend, looking at the data a half\-year at a time 

shows that, for both halves of the year, the use of malware 

was trending back up.

Ominous bellwethers appeared in the monthly data, as well. 

In August, malware volume soared to 537 million, breaking 

the 500 million mark for the first time since March 2020\.

The average monthly malware volume was roughly 80 million 

higher in the second half of 2021 than in the second half of 

2020 — and unfortunately this wasn’t due to one anomalous 

month, but to sustained higher volume overall.

Vietnam, where malware spread in 2021 was 36\.4%. 

Interestingly, South Korea — where malware spread was the 

highest last year, at 51\.4% — saw a huge drop in malware

Ransomware’s Savage Reign

When ransomware started to spike in the second half 

of 2020, it set off alarm bells within the cybersecurity 

community and around the world.

But the ransomware volume in the worst month of 

2020 — 37\.8 million, observed in November — barely 

exceeded the lowest point for 2021, and we would see that 

number more than double by year’s end.

In what would become one of the worst years for ransomware 

ever recorded by SonicWall, attack volume rose 105% to 

a staggering 623\.3 million. This represented an average of 

2,170 ransomware attempts per customer, and nearly 20 

ransomware attempts every second.

Nearly 20 ransomware 
attempts every second.

A 105% increase year\-over\-year is worrisome enough. But 

to truly understand ransomware’s meteoric rise, it helps 

to compare 2021’s ransomware volume to 2019 as well. 

Ransomware has risen a mind\-blowing 231\.7% since 2019\. 

While 2021’s high\-water mark was more than double that 

of 2020, it more than tripled the ransomware volume in the 

worst month of 2019 (May, which saw a ransomware volume 

of 25 million). 

29 \| 2022 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report \| Ransomware

The number of hits per month started off strong in January, 

when ransomware volume reached 43\.1 million, besting 

2020’s worst month (Nov. 2020, with 37\.8 million attempts) 

right out of the gate. But ransomware, like the year itself, had 

only just gotten started.

In June, ransomware reached a high of 78\.4 million — a level 

higher than three out of four quarters in 2020\.

In fact, with 304\.7 million attempts, the first half of 2021 had 

more ransomware than all of 2020 — but the second half 

would prove to be even worse, reaching 318\.6 million.

The year’s only bright spot came in Q4: Ransomware hits for 

the quarter dropped 50 million from their sky\-high Q3 totals, 

near where the year started. 

In fact, with 304\.7 million 
attempts, the first half of 2021

Ransomware by Region

In North America, ransomware rose 104%, just under the 105% 

average increase worldwide. But other regions had it much 

worse. In Asia, ransomware rose 122%, and in Europe, the 

number of hits climbed even more, rising 175% year over year.

To put Europe’s increase in perspective, consider that it had 

been at least five years since monthly ransomware totals had 

surpassed 10 million — but in June 2021, they reached 10\.4 

million. The month of September, however, had more than 

double this number at 22\.3 million attempts — more than half 

as many as in the entire year of 2020\.

Until 2021, the countries that experienced the most 

ransomware were the U.S. and the U.K. Both saw large 

year\-over\-year increases, with ransomware volume in the 

U.S. rising 98% to 421\.5 million and ransomware in the U.K. 

rising 227% to 33\.5 million. 

In Asia, ransomware rose 122%, 
and in Europe, the number 
of hits climbed even more, 
rising 175% year over year.

But Germany saw a far higher increase in ransomware 

volume. The number of ransomware hits there rose to 34\.3 

million in 2021, a mind\-blowing 3,256% year\-over\-year 

increase and enough to unseat the U.K. as second in line, 

according to SonicWall data.

Attackers’ Horrifying New 
Tactic: Triple Extortion
In our mid\-year report, we described the rising trend of 

double extortion, a scam in which ransomware groups 

exfiltrate data prior to issuing a ransom note and encrypting 

the system, then use that data as leverage to increase the 

odds of securing payment. 

But some organizations still refused to pay on principle, while 

others suspected — with good reason — that paying the 

ransom would not actually guarantee the safety of their data.

As ransomware operators recently discovered, however, 

just because an organization refuses to pay a ransom, that 

doesn’t mean its customers will refuse to pay.

Like double extortion, triple extortion begins with 

ransomware operators exfiltrating large quantities of data, 

usually before encrypting the victim’s network. But where 

double extortion groups threaten to release this data, triple 

the attacker began contacting the therapy patients 

themselves, attempting to extort $240 from them ($500 if 

not paid within 24 hours) in exchange for not leaking their 

personal therapy session notes. 

Even more shocking, however, is who the criminals targeted: 

The list of victims targeted included a number of children, 

police officers and a dying man.

The REvil ransomware group is even adding such harassment 

to its RaaS offerings. In March, the group announced that it 

would, as a free service, begin making voice\-scrambled VOIP 

calls to notify the target’s business partners and the media 

about the attack.

Notable Infrastructure Attacks in 2021: 

Colonial Pipeline – May 7, 2021

In May, cybercriminal group Darkside gained entry to 

America’s largest fuel pipeline, Colonial Pipeline, via 

a compromised password posted on the Dark Web. In 

addition to enabling the exfiltration of nearly 100 GB of 

data, the attack led to a six\-day outage as the company 

investigated, causing fuel shortages, gas hoarding and 

panic. While Colonial reportedly paid the ransom to avoid 

release of the data, the group’s gains were short lived. After 

the attack drew international attention, DarkSide posted an 

apology for “creating problems for society” and reportedly 

disbanded soon after.

JBS Foods – May 30, 2021

The world’s largest meat producer was the victim of a 

ransomware attack perpetrated by cybercriminal group 

REvil. This attack forced the company to temporarily close 

its beef plants in the U.S., disrupted a Canadian plant, and 

brought a halt to meat processing in Australia. While JBS 

claims that none of its data was exfiltrated, faced with the 

prospect of a prolonged shutdown, the company admitted in 

June that it had paid an $11 million ransom.

NEW Cooperative – September 20, 2021

In September, ransomware group BlackMatter gained access 

to NEW Cooperative’s network. The cybercriminal group 

reportedly stole 1 TB of data and threatened to release it 

if a $5\.9 million ransom was not paid. In the meantime, the 

company lost access to the networks used to accept grain 

shipments, deliver feed and keep feeding schedules on track 

for millions of chickens, hogs and cattle.

Cryptojacking 

Bigger than Ever

In 2021, the number of cryptojacking attempts rose to 97 

million, an increase of 19% year over year and an average of 

338 cryptojacking attempts per customer network.

While cryptojacking volume didn’t see the sort of triple\-

digit increases that were observed with ransomware and 

encrypted attacks, this moderate increase was still enough 

for 2021 to set a new all\-time record. 

This wasn’t the only cryptojacking record 2021 set, however. 

With 34\.2 million hits, the first quarter of 2021 saw more 

cryptojacking than any other quarter since SonicWall 

began tracking it.

But worryingly, the worst month for cryptojacking in 2021 

was, by far, December: While the 13\.6 million hits recorded 

in December don’t eclipse the anomalous 15\.5 million hits 

observed in March 2020, it makes for an easy second place, 

and a highly suboptimal starting point for 2022\.

With 34\.2 million hits, the

Cryptojacking by Region

Despite 2021 being a record\-breaking year, only one region 

saw a large increase: Europe, where cryptojacking volume 

rose 60% according to SonicWall data. 

North America saw a year\-over\-year rise in cryptojacking as 

well, but at 13% it was fairly modest — especially compared 

to the 260% jump recorded in 2020\.

In Asia, cryptojacking continued the massive freefall that 

began in 2019\. While cryptojacking that year reached 35\.7 

million hits, volume fell 87% in 2020 and another 37% in 

2021\. Asia’s cryptojacking volume in 2021 was just under 

3 million hits — less than a tenth of what it was two years ago.

North America saw a 
year\-over\-year rise 
in cryptojacking

In the U.S., cryptojacking volume rose just 4%, due in part 

to a highly depressed Q3\. In contrast with Q1 and Q4, which 

notched 30 million hits and 23\.1 million hits respectively, the 

entirety of Q3 saw just 4\.1 million hits — or 5\.7% of the total 

yearly cryptojacking volume.

Despite these increases, education customers are the ones

provider globally behind Amazon Web Services, Microsoft 

Azure and Google Cloud. 

After disabling Alibaba’s cloud monitoring agent and cloud 

assistant service, the malware is able to execute without 

notifying the machine’s owner. It disables other processes 

and cryptomining services that can compete for CPU 

resources, then downloads and executes the XMRig miner.

Due to being widely available and easy to use, XMRig 

continued to be the cryptojacking program of choice in 

2021\. One of the file\-based cryptojacking tools that came to 

prominence following Coinhive’s shuttering in 2019, XMRig is 

an open\-source cross\-platform miner. 

The Rise of Cryptocurrency Stealers
Cybercriminals are always on the hunt for a quicker and 

easier way to make money. So, when it became possible 

to steal cryptocurrency from a machine directly, instead 

of making the machine mine coin over time, attackers 

jumped on board.

In November, SonicWall Capture Labs threat researchers 

identified an Android app (see below) designed to 

steal crypto wallets from victims. This malicious app 

is called “Trust: Crypto \& Bitcoin Wallet,” and purports 

to be associated with the (legitimate) TrustWallet 

cryptocurrency wallet. 

43 \| 2022 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report \| Cryptojacking

But despite its name, it isn’t to be trusted: Once installed, 

the malicious app requests the user grant Accessibility 

Services “to confirm you as a human (not a robot),” and 

notifies the user that the app will not work without these 

services being turned on. Once on, this app can perform 

clicks in the background without the user’s knowledge and, 

by acting on behalf of the user, it automatically transfers the 

cryptocurrency from the user’s wallet to the wallet of the 

malware operator.

Criminals don’t always go after individuals’ crypto wallets, 

however. Sometimes they attack cryptocurrency exchanges 

directly. In 2021, there were over 20 attacks on crypto 

exchanges or projects in which a cybercriminal stole at 

least $10 million in cryptocurrencies. And in more than a 

quarter of these cases, the amount stolen surpassed the 

$100 million mark.

In August, the Poly Network was breached when an attacker 

“exploited a vulnerability between contract calls,” and stole a 

reported $610 million (all of which was ultimately returned.)

everyone patches at the same rate, and attacks take 

advantage of unpatched appliances or software that can 

be used as an entry into a network. (A more serious and 

dangerous scenario is when a vulnerability is not yet well 

publicized or has not yet been published — these are the 

dreaded zero\-day vulnerabilities.) 

What SonicWall records is detection and prevention 

of vulnerabilities — coming both from external and 

internal sources. When a piece of code that constitutes 

a vulnerability passes a firewall with Intrusion Prevention 

enabled, and the firewall detects and neutralizes that code, 

an intrusion attempt is counted. 

As noted, low\-severity intrusions are typically benign.

\& RTDMI

RTDMI Gets Smarter, 
Faster, Better

2021 was another banner year for SonicWall’s patented 

Real\-Time Deep Memory Inspection™ (RTDMI) technology. 

A total of 442,151 total never\-before\-seen malware variants 

was identified in 2021, a 65% increase over 2020’s count and 

an average of 1,211 per day. 

When RTDMI was added to SonicWall’s existing Capture 

Advanced Threat Protection, it began identifying a large 

number of never\-before\-seen malware variants almost 

immediately. RTDMI is capable of finding malware that 

relies on various anti\-evasion techniques — frequently 

variants of existing malware that have been obfuscated, 

repacked or recompiled in such a way as to evade all existing 

industry detections. 

What Is RTDMI?

Introduced in early 2018, SonicWall’s patented 

Real\-Time Deep Memory Inspection™ engine detects 

and blocks malware that doesn’t exhibit malicious 

behavior and hides its weaponry via encryption. 

Each year, RTDMI leverages proprietary memory 

inspection, CPU instruction tracking and machine 

learning capabilities to become smarter, more agile 

and more efficient at recognizing and mitigating 

cyberattacks never before seen by anyone in the 

cybersecurity industry.

variants reached 50,418, surpassing the 50,000 mark for 

the first time ever. This feat would be repeated the very next 

month, when the total for November reached 51,633\. 

In 14 of the last 16 quarters, the number of new malware 

variants has exceeded that found in the previous quarter. A 

total of 141,390 never\-before\-seen malware variants were 

recorded in Q4 2021 — more than any quarter on record.

This growth indicates that the creation of new variants for 

existing malware — ones able to bypass detection by a 

majority of the industry tools on the market — is becoming 

increasingly accessible and more frequently utilized. This 

is a worrisome development: If any one of these attacks 

gets past an organization’s defenses, it can result in a 

ransomware infection.

Malicious PDF/
Office Files

Malicious Office and PDF Files Reverse Course

In 2021, SonicWall Capture Labs threat researchers recorded 

a 52% year\-over\-year increase in the overall use of malicious 

PDFs, while use of malicious Microsoft Office files fell 64%.

This represents a significant reversal from a year ago. In 

2020, SonicWall Capture Labs threat researchers noted 

that cybercriminal groups were shifting from PDFs to Office 

files in their 2021 malware campaigns, driving last year’s 

percentage of malicious PDF files down 22%, and catapulting 

the percentage of malicious Office files up 67%. 

But it’s important not to conflate the percentage increase 

with the percentage of total files. For instance, the number 

of malicious PDFs detected showed double\-digit growth, but 

since PDFs only represented 9\.2% of all malicious files last 

year, the percentage of total malicious files that were PDFs 

was still pretty small in 2021\.

Office files, on the other hand, were a quarter of all malicious

files picked up most of the slack, doubling from just over 15% 

to roughly 30%.

Beware Muscle Memory
With cloud platforms overtaking programs installed on 

devices, and with two\-factor authentication (2FA) becoming 

the norm among companies looking to harden their security 

posture, the average user now enters their login credentials 

several times a day. While it’s tempting to let muscle memory 

take over and get through the process as quickly as possible, 

doing so may open you up to credential theft.

A majority of the HTML phishing 
emails observed in 2021 were 
designed to launch a login 
form, which is prefilled with 
a user’s email address.

Filenames to Look Out For in 2022
The trend of borrowed legitimacy continued to the 

filenames used in these campaigns. Because most people 

know enough to look at a filename before opening it — 

and because virtually no one is going to open a file with a 

name like “InfoStealer.xlsm” or “malware.exe” — phishing 

groups name their malicious files to maximize both 

gravitas and urgency.

But while you’re highly likely to receive a malicious file called 

“Document,” the odds of it actually being a document (as in, a 

Microsoft Word file) are only about 1 in 12\. The vast majority 

of malicious Office files are Excel spreadsheets, with .xlsm 

being the most common extension.

Who is Rabota?

Along with the trends and volume associated with malicious Microsoft Office files, 

SonicWall also tracks various other attributes of these files. In 2021, researchers 

noted that there was a roughly 50% chance that, if you came across a malicious 

Office file, it would have “Rabota” listed as the author.

While this sounds like it could be someone’s name, there isn’t actually a person 

named Rabota furiously cranking out mass quantities of malicious Office files. As 

it turns out, “Rabota” is the Russian word for work, or job.

While the expected “Admin,” “Test,” “Tester” and “USER” also appeared on the list 

of malicious Office file authors, there was one entry on the list that was an actual 

name: “Brian.” With nearly 10% of 2021’s malicious Office files credited to him, 

Brian must be a busy guy.

IoT Malware

IoT Malware Shows 
Signs of Stabilizing

IoT malware continued to climb last year: SonicWall Capture 

Labs threat researchers recorded 60\.1 million IoT malware 

hits in 2021, the highest number ever recorded by SonicWall 

in a single year. 

In March, researchers recorded 6\.8 million instances of 

IoT malware, the highest monthly total recorded all year. 

This didn’t come close to beating the monthly record set 

in October 2020, which saw 10\.8 million hits, but higher 

monthly totals of IoT malware overall resulted in a 6% 

year\-over\-year increase. 

While an increase in attacks is never good news, it’s better 

than it has been. In 2019 and 2020, IoT malware volume

rose 218% and 66% respectively. With no corresponding 

slowdown in the proliferation of connected devices, this 

suggests attack volumes may be leveling off.

Some attack types, such as IoT attacks, seem to rise reliably 

In April, 2021’s low\-water mark, the percentage of

non\-standard port attacks fell to 9%, the lowest since

for the next several months or years before reversing 

which these attacks sink below 10%. While the cadence of

Non\-standard port attacks follow neither of these patterns.

Since SonicWall began tracking non\-standard port attacks in 

2018, they’ve followed a consistent, pendulum\-like pattern, 

rising in even\-numbered years, and falling in odd. 

In 2021, the pendulum swung back, bringing with it a 10% 

decrease in non\-standard port attacks and wiping out most —

non\-standard port attacks follows a predictable rise\-and\-fall 

pattern, we’ve seen both the crests and the troughs of these 

attacks trend higher over time. 

If this continues to hold true, there’s a good chance the 2023 

SonicWall Cyber Threat Report will feature non\-standard 

port attacks breaking the 30% mark.

What is a Non\-Standard Port Attack?
In networking, a port helps complete the destination or 

origination network address of a message. About 40,000 

ports are registered; however, only a small number — the 

“standard” ports — are typically used. For example, HTTP 

uses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443 and SMTP uses port 25\. 

Services using a port that isn’t the one assigned to them by 

default, usually as defined by the IANA port numbers registry, 

are using a non\-standard port. 

With so many ports to monitor, 
these legacy firewalls 
can’t mitigate attacks over 
non\-standard ports.

There’s nothing inherently wrong with using non\-standard 

non\-standard ports to increase the odds their payloads can

focus their protection on traffic passing through the 

standard ports.

Modern firewalls that are capable of analyzing specific 

artifacts (as opposed to all traffic) can detect these attacks,

Conclusion

Proactive Defense is the 
Future of Cybersecurity

Cybercrime has evolved, making it harder for defenders to protect 

against, detect and stop attacks from entering their networks. As the 

pace of attacks continues to increase, and the ways attackers breach 

and infiltrate systems continue to become more targeted and evasive, 

the future will increasingly belong to the proactive. 

Proactive organizations have a thorough understanding of both their 

network and the threat landscape, allowing them to adapt and shift 

just as agilely as cybercriminals. This enables them to quickly detect 

and stop attacks.

Dark Reading, in partnership with SonicWall,

offers an in\-depth discussion on how you can ensure business continuity, protect 

your employees and customers, and help you maintain compliance with a proactive 

cybersecurity strategy. 

This webinar covers the importance of:

• Having a complete picture of where data lives and how it moves

• Knowing what third parties may be storing data, including cloud vendors, and how they approach 

security, including their incident response plan

• Employing threat hunting to detect threats that evade existing security controls

• Deploying endpoint protection to look for indicators of compromise and protect the system when 

potential threats are identified

• Patching vulnerabilities

• And more
