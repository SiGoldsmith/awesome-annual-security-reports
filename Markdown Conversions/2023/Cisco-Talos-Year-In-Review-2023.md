Introduction

R ansomware, commodity loaders and APTs 

outline in the second annual Cisco Talos Year in 

dominated the threat landscape in 2023\. As we’ll 

Review, global conflict influenced cybersecurity trends, 

shifting many threat actors’ tactics and approaches in 

operations ranging from espionage to cybercrime. 

Cisco’s global presence and Talos’ 
world\-class expertise provided a 
massive amount of data to sift through — 
endpoint detections, incident response 
engagements, network traffic, email 
corpus, sandboxes, honeypots and much 
more. Thankfully, our teammates include 
subject matter experts from all ends of 
the cybersecurity space to help us turn 
this intelligence into actionable information 
for defenders and users. Leveraging these 
rich, complex sources of information, we 
analyzed the major trends that shaped the 
threat landscape in 2023\. 

Ransomware continued to threaten 
enterprises globally in 2023, with LockBit 
remaining the top threat in this space for 
the second year in a row. Health care 
was the top targeted industry this year, 
as adversaries maintained their focus on 
entities that have cybersecurity funding 
constraints and low downtime tolerance. 
Not all things were the same, though, as 
we saw actors such as Clop deploy a 

collection of zero\-day exploits, behavior 
we usually associate with advanced 
persistent threat (APT) activity. At the 
same time, leaked ransomware source 
code allowed low\-skilled actors to enter 
the fray. Further complicating matters, 
we observed a new trend of ransomware 
actors turning to pure extortion, skipping 
encryption altogether while threatening to 
leak sensitive data. 

Commodity loaders are still being used 
to deliver these ransomware threats, and 
many of the same families as last year 
remained prevalent, such as Qakbot and 
IcedID. This is reflected in our telemetry, 
as the most commonly spoofed brands 
were in financial services and shipping, 
hallmarks of these adversaries. But these 
loaders are shedding all remnants of 
their banking trojan past as they position 
themselves more as sleek payload delivery 
mechanisms. Developers and operators 
are adapting to improved defenses, finding 
new ways to bypass increasing security 

updates and compromise victims. And 
although we again observed a takedown 
of a large botnet, this year being Qakbot, 
our experience shows that this does not 
necessarily mean that the threat has been 
eliminated. 

One of the newer cross\-regional 
trends we have observed this year is 
an increase in the targeting of network 
devices from APTs and ransomware 
actors. Both groups rely on exploiting 
recently disclosed vulnerabilities and 
weak/default credentials, one of the 
reasons why the use of valid accounts 
was consistently a top weakness in 
Talos IR engagements. Whatever the 
sophistication and intent of the adversary 
is, the reason behind the targeting is the 
same: network devices are extremely 
high value while possessing many 
security weaknesses. 

Geopolitical instability is manifesting 
in APT activity. This is reflected in 
our telemetry, which shows a rise 
in suspicious traffic during major 
geopolitical events. For Chinese groups, 
as relationships with the West and Asia 
Pacific become further strained, we see 
an emboldening in operations, such as a 
greater willingness to cause destruction. 
We also observe this in their targeting of 
telecommunications organizations, which 
possess numerous critical infrastructure 
assets in strategically important 
geographies such as Guam and Taiwan. 
For Russian APTs, Gamaredon and 
Turla targeted Ukraine at an accelerated 

pace, but Russian activity in general for 
2023 did not reflect the full range of 
destructive cyber capabilities we have 
seen it deploy in the past, potentially 
because of the concerted efforts of 
defenders. 

One bright spot this year was Cisco’s 
determined efforts to create and deliver 
inventive security solutions that help 
strengthen our partners. Talos’ Ukraine 
Task Force continues to thwart attacks 
against critical Ukrainian partners. This 
year, we spear\-headed an effort to 
stabilize Ukraine’s power grid against the 
effects of global positioning system (GPS) 
jamming on the battlefield by delivering 
modified Cisco switches into an active war 
zone. Cisco also launched the Network 
Resilience Coalition with leading industry 
partners, focusing on increasing awareness 
and providing actionable recommendations 
for improving network security. Relatedly, 
Talos’s Vulnerability Discovery and 
Research Team made investigating small 
office, home office (SOHO) and industrial 
routers a major priority, reporting 289 
vulnerabilities to vendors to date, published 
across 141 Talos advisories. 

As conflict in the Middle East worsens, 
we are once again positioned to help 
protect our customers and partners. 
Therefore, perhaps the overarching 
story of 2023 is this: as the daringness, 
sophistication, and persistence of our 
adversaries grows, so too does the 
resolve of defenders to interdict them in 
any way we can.

trends

Section highlights

• Suspicious network traffic captured by Cisco Security products revealed 

sharp increases in activity that often corresponded with major geopolitical 
events and global cyber attacks. 

• The most targeted vulnerabilities were older security flaws in common 
applications, consistent with the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency’s (CISA) findings in recent years. Most of the top\-
targeted vulnerabilities we observed received maximum\- or high\-severity 
scores by Cisco Kenna and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System 
(CVSS) and were also included in CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities 
catalog. The high frequency of targeting attempts against these CVEs, 
paired with their significant impact, underscores adversaries’ preference 
to target unpatched systems that can cause major disruptions. 

• Threat actors abused common file extensions and spoofed well\-known 

brands, common techniques that underscore the use of social engineering 
to enable operations like phishing and business email compromise (BEC). 
Adversaries are likely responding to Microsoft’s disabling of macros in 
2022 by using different file types to hide their malware, such as PDFs, 
which was the top blocked file extension this year. 

• Financial services and shipping companies accounted for the brands 

we observed being spoofed most often in email telemetry, suggesting 
longstanding phishing themes for email\-based commodity loaders 
like Emotet, Qakbot and Trickbot are still at play. Relatedly, phishing 
accounted for a quarter of known initial access vectors in Talos IR 
engagements this year, highlighting actors’ continued reliance on this 
technique. 

• The use of valid accounts was a top\-observed MITRE ATT\&CK technique, 
underscoring adversaries’ reliance on compromised credentials and use 
of existing accounts for various stages of their attacks. This is consistent 
with Talos IR data, which showed compromised credentials/valid accounts 
accounted for nearly a third of known initial access vectors in 2023\.

Regional trends over time

Suspicious traffic includes a wide variety of 

categorized information sourced from multiple 

Cisco Security products, including Umbrella, 

Secure Endpoint, Email Security Appliance 

(ESA), Meraki, SSE and Secure Firewall. 

Examples include malicious domains blocked 

by Umbrella, records with malicious dispositions 

from Secure Endpoint, phishing emails from 

ESA, triggered Snort signatures from Secure 

Firewall and Meraki, and many others.

In North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and 
Latin America, suspicious network traffic was periodic, following 
a Monday \- Friday workday pattern for much of the year. Starting 
mid\-year, we saw a break from this pattern marked by a dramatic 
increase in traffic blocked by our security products, often 
quadrupling the early part of the year’s normal behavior. 

In mid\-February, these regions experienced various spikes in web 
spam. While spam volume was up globally, it disproportionally 
affected the Asia Pacific, Japan and China (APJC) region. 

In APJC, suspicious traffic was less periodic and experienced 
large swings in volume between January and April. These 
changes leveled out through the spring and early summer. 

Various international events and major cyber attacks overlayed 
on the graph suggest how such activity can affect the threat 
landscape. While it’s impossible to prove causation, there are 
obvious correlations between the suspicious global and regional 
traffic patterns we observed and significant world events.

Top targeted vulnerabilities

In 2023, cyber threat actors exploited older software vulnerabilities 
in common applications. In many cases, the vulnerabilities were 
more than 10 years old, consistent with CISA’s finding that 
adversaries have targeted old security flaws more than newly 
disclosed ones in recent years. In fact, four of the top five most\-
targeted vulnerabilities we observed were also cited by CISA as 
being frequently exploited in prior years, further highlighting this 
point. This underscores the need for entities to regularly install 
software updates, as many of these systems were likely unpatched 
given the age of the targeted vulnerabilities. 

The top targeted vulnerabilities are found in common applications, 
like Microsoft Office. This finding is also substantiated by CISA, 
which noted that actors in 2022 prioritize CVEs that are more 
prevalent in their targets’ networks. Adversaries likely prioritize 
targeting widespread vulnerabilities because the exploits 
developed for such CVEs can have long\-term use and high impact. 

Lastly, most of the vulnerabilities on our list would cause substantial 
impact if exploited, with six receiving a maximum vulnerability risk 
score of 100 from Cisco Kenna and seven receiving the highest 
“critical” score from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System 
(CVSS). Most of the CVEs are also listed in CISA’s Known Exploited 
Vulnerabilities catalog, which is meant to inform users on the 
security flaws for which they should prioritize remediation. The high 
frequency of targeting attempts against these CVEs, paired with 
their severity, underscores the risk to unpatched systems.

Email findings

TOP BLOCKED ATTACHMENT 
FILE EXTENSIONS

Phishing emails are one of the most common 
ways adversaries compromise victims and this 
has consistently been a top\-ranked threat in 
Talos IR findings for years. In the last year alone, 
25 percent of the initial access vectors identified 
in Talos IR engagements were comprised of 
phishing (this refers to chart 3b). This observation 
is consistent with U.S. government findings, with 
the FBI noting that phishing was the top incident 
reported to its Internet Crime Complaint Center 
(IC3\) in 2022\. 

Threat actors commonly send unsolicited emails 
requesting users download or open an attachment 
to deliver malware. While file extension is not 
necessarily indicative of file type, actors frequently 
try to hide malware under well\-known file 
extensions to appear less suspicious, so users 
are more likely to open them. For example, earlier 
this year, Japan’s Computer Emergency Response 
Team (JP\-CERT) warned that adversaries were 
embedding malicious Word documents in PDF 
files to bypass detection, a strategy we have seen 
threat actors rely on for years. 

Threat actors’ file type preference was also likely 
affected by Microsoft’s 2022 decision to block 
macros, which adversaries had heavily abused up 
to that point. With this change, actors have moved 
away from using Microsoft Office files like Word 
and Excel as frequently as they once did. In 2023, 
we saw the commodity loader Ursnif incorporate 
malicious PDF attachments into their phishing 
operations for the first time as this actor and other 
groups looked for ways to avoid relying on macros.

TOP BRANDS SPOOFED IN SENDER NAMES

Cybercriminals and other malicious actors rely 
heavily on social engineering tactics to compromise 
users, which is why they commonly imitate 
well\-known companies in their phishing emails. 
Commodity loaders like Emotet, Qakbot and Trickbot, 
for instance, routinely use fake invoices, bank 
statements, or shipping notifications as phishing 
themes to feign legitimacy. This is reflected in our list 
of top spoofed brands, where we see that financial 
services entities and shipping services were among 
those that actors most frequently spoofed.

Business email compromise (BEC) operations also 
leverage spoofed company names to enhance 
legitimacy. BEC is a scam in which cybercriminals 
send emails to targets that appear to come from 
a known source making a legitimate request. The 
goal is to prompt the target to make unauthorized 
money transfers to the threat actor. Actors may 
impersonate well\-known and trusted brands, like 
those represented in our list, to trick users. BEC has 
been on the rise in recent years, according to the 
FBI, and resulting in $2\.7 billion in losses in 2022\.

Top MITRE ATT\&CK techniques

Notably, nearly a third of the top 20 most common MITRE ATT\&CK techniques fall under the defense evasion 

tactic, suggesting actors are devoting substantial resources to this phase of the attack chain. Techniques relating 

to privilege escalation and persistence also ranked high, highlighting their importance in the attack lifecycle.

Hijack execution flow was the most common technique, 
appearing nearly twice as often as the next highest result. Hijacking 
execution flow refers to actors co\-opting the way an operating 
system runs programs on a target endpoint. DLL side\-loading is a 
common example of this, whereby actors essentially position their 
malware alongside the victim application so that when the program 
searches for its legitimate DLL, it also unwittingly executes the 
malicious payload. This is an effective way for actors to hide their 
activities under legitimate and trusted software, a technique we 
commonly see leveraged by APTs and cybercriminals.

The use of valid accounts was the second\-most common technique 
we observed, underscoring adversaries’ reliance on compromised 
credentials and use of existing accounts. Actors use this technique 
to enable various stages of the attack chain. We commonly see 
commodity loaders deploying information\-stealing malware for this 
very purpose. Relatedly, credentials from password stores ranked 
in the top five, further highlighting actors’ focus on obtaining user 
credentials. These findings are consistent with Talos IR data, which 
showed compromised credentials/valid accounts accounted for 
nearly a quarter of known initial access vectors in 2023\.

Resource hijacking, which ranked in the top 10, is a technique we 
typically see associated with the deployment of cryptocurrency mining 
malware, which hijacks an endpoint’s processing power for profitable 
gains. Cryptocurrency mining threats are highly common, as this is a 
low\-level type of attack typically carried out by unsophisticated actors. 
We often see this type of malware deployed, especially soon after 
new vulnerabilities are disclosed, before victims have time to patch 
and/or in conjunction with other, more complex, malware.

2023YEAR IN REVIEWVolume of attacks using technique \& associated tacticsTechniquesRansomware 
and extortion

Section highlights

• Ransomware and pre\-ransomware incidents continue to affect customers 
at a consistent rate — totaling the same 20 percent of Talos IR incidents as 
last year — with health care being the most targeted vertical. 

• For the second year in a row, LockBit was the most prolific ransomware\-
as\-a\-service (RaaS) gang, based on our findings, consistent with CISA’s 
assessment that it is the most deployed ransomware variant. LockBit 
was one of the most frequently observed ransomware threats in Talos IR 
this year, and affiliates accounted for more than 25 percent of the total 
number of victim posts on data leak sites across some 40 ransomware 
groups we monitor. 

• ALPHV, Clop and BianLian also dominated the threat landscape, 

accounting for another quarter of all ransomware and/or data extortion 
compromises publicized on dark web actor sites. 

• We saw Clop affiliates consistently exploit zero\-day vulnerabilities, a 

highly unusual tactic given the expertise, personnel and access required 
to develop such exploits, suggesting the group possesses a level of 
sophistication and/or resources matched only by advanced persistent 
threats (APTs). 

• New ransomware variants are emerging that leverage leaked source 

code from other RaaS groups, allowing less skilled actors to enter this 
space. At the same time, we also see highly sophisticated operators like 
Clop leveraging zero\-day vulnerabilities at an unprecedented pace, an 
interesting dichotomy demonstrating the breadth of actors in this space. 

• Actors are turning to data extortion more than ever, with this being the 
top threat that Talos IR responded to in Q2 2023 (April \- June). Data 
theft extortion looks very similar to pre\-ransomware activity, creating 
challenges for defenders. 

• Some actors are abandoning ransomware use altogether, opting for 

extortion instead, a trend likely influenced by ongoing law enforcement 
operations, better industry detections and lower operational costs.

T he ransomware space remained dynamic in 2023, with groups continuing 

a\-service (RaaS) outfits at a time, and new groups continually emerging. 

to rebrand or merge, actors often working for multiple ransomware\-as\-

The skill levels varied greatly as well, with experienced actors developing 

sophisticated exploits for zero\-day vulnerabilities, while less\-skilled actors 

relied on repurposed ransomware code to create their own threats. We also 

saw an emerging trend in this space, as more actors began to abandon the use 

of ransomware and resort to pure data theft extortion without encrypting files, 

presenting a new line of challenges for defenders. Despite these changes, one 

thing remains constant: Ransomware remains a top threat to entities worldwide.

Ransomware attacks persist 
at steady pace

Ransomware and pre\-ransomware made up 20 
percent of the total incidents that Talos IR responded 
to this year, a very slight drop compared to last year. 
It can be difficult for defenders to determine what 
constitutes a pre\-ransomware attack if a ransomware 
binary is never executed and encryption does not 
take place. However, there are some indications 
analysts use to assess if ransomware is the likely final 
objective, such as the use of adversary simulation 
frameworks like Cobalt Strike and/or credential\-
harvesting tools like Mimikatz, the targeting of certain 
critical assets such as backups, or enumeration and 
discovery techniques.

The health care and public health sector was the 
most targeted vertical in Talos IR ransomware and 
pre\-ransomware engagements this year, compared 
to the education sector in 2022, as reported in 

last year’s Year in Review report (see Figure 1\). 
Healthcare organizations are highly vulnerable to 
cyber attacks given their low downtime tolerance, 
often underfunded cybersecurity budgets, and 
possession of protected health information (PHI) that 
is valuable to threat actors. The COVID\-19 pandemic 
likely exacerbated this situation in recent years, 
with healthcare providers strained from a resource 
perspective and downtime being even less tolerable.

Old foes are top offenders as 
LockBit remains top threat

For a second year in a row, LockBit was the most 
active RaaS group, accounting for over 25 percent 
of the total number of posts made to data leak sites. 
LockBit, ALPHV, Clop and BianLian accounted for 
nearly 50 percent of the total posts made to leak sites 
this year (Figure 2\).

Ransomware space remains 
crowded with new and 
rebranded groups 

Ransomware groups’ constant rebranding and/or 
turnover was a prominent trend this year. Multiple 
leaks of ransomware source code and builders — 
components essential to creating and modifying 
ransomware — have had a significant effect on 
the ransomware threat landscape. These leaks 
allow ransomware operators to rebrand or give 
unsophisticated actors the ability to generate their 
own ransomware more easily with little effort or 
knowledge. As more actors enter this space, Talos is 

seeing an increasing number of ransomware variants 
emerge leveraging leaked ransomware code, often 
leading to more frequent attacks and new challenges 
for cybersecurity professionals and defenders, 
particularly regarding actor attribution.

The volume of new ransomware variants based 
on leaked source code also highlights the speed 
at which actors take advantage of such public 
disclosures. Most recently, we observed a surge 
in new ransomware strains emerging from the 
Yashma ransomware builder. First appearing in May 
2022, Yashma is a rebranded version of the Chaos 
ransomware builder (v5\), which was leaked in April 
2022\. Since early 2023, we have seen several 
new Yashma strains emerge, including ANXZ and 
Sirattacker, likely deployed by smaller or groups of 
affiliates with fewer resources given their lack of 
widespread adoption and notoriety in the landscape. 
In April, we discovered a new ransomware actor, 

Talos IR responds to 
LockBit incident affecting 
IT and OT networks

Talos IR responded to a LockBit ransomware 
incident affecting a utilities company where 
ransomware infiltrated the organization’s IT and 
OT networks, causing significant impact to the 
victim and downstream disruptions to customers. 
The ransomware affiliate gained initial access using 
valid router credentials authenticating over VPN 
where multi\-factor authentication (MFA) was not 
implemented. The attackers encrypted production 
servers, including those monitoring the electrical 
grid, and three of four domain controllers were 
encrypted, as well.

LockBit continued to conduct prolific ransomware operations in 
2023, a finding that aligns with CISA’s assessment that it is the 
most deployed ransomware variant. LockBit attacks can be very 
impactful, affecting an organization’s information technology (IT) 
networks and operational technology (OT), the hardware and 
machines responsible for physical processes, as we have observed 
in Talos IR engagements. In October, CISA published guidance 
for securing OT environments, underscoring how significant the 
impact can be to these systems. LockBit was also deployed during 
the exploitation of two vulnerabilities in the PaperCut software, 
a print management solution widely used across entities in the 
government and education verticals, among others. 

Posts made to the group’s data leak site ebbed and flowed 
throughout the year, with detections of LockBit activity appearing

RA Group, deploying their ransomware variant 
based on the leaked Babuk source code. Since an 
alleged member of the Babuk group leaked the full 
source code of its ransomware in September 2021, 
several new variants based on the leaked code have 
emerged, with many appearing in 2023, including 
ESXiArgs, Rorschach and RTM Locker.

While these changes in the threat landscape have 
largely benefitted affiliates, security researchers 
and defenders also have an advantage with access 
to the leaked code. It allows security researchers 
to analyze the source code and understand the 
attacker’s TTPs and develop effective detection 
rules, potentially aid in the creation of decryptors 
and enhance security products’ capabilities in 
combating ransomware threats.

Affiliates turning to data theft 
extortion over ransomware 
deployment

Even with the expanding number of RaaS options, 
some have found success in extorting funds without 
deploying ransomware. In these extortion instances, 
an adversary steals the victim’s data but does not 
encrypt it. The common double extortion tactic is 
thereby eliminated, with the actor relying solely on 
the threat of leaking the information rather than also 
demanding payment to unlock the files. This trend 
is also reflected in Talos IR engagements, where 
extortion was the most observed threat in Q2 2023, 
accounting for almost a third of threats seen, a 25 
percent increase from the prior quarter (January\-
April) (Figure 4\).

Several well\-known ransomware gangs — including 
Babuk, BianLian and Clop — have opted for data theft 

extortion over ransomware, a departure from the 
groups’ typical ransomware attack chain (Figure 5\).

Several factors have likely contributed to some threat 
actors’ preferences for data theft extortion instead 
of deploying ransomware. U.S. and international law 
enforcement have aggressively pursued ransomware 
actors in recent years, conducting major disruptions 
against well\-known groups. Advancements in 
endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities 
have likely been a significant obstacle for threat 
actors seeking to deploy ransomware and encrypt 
data. Adversaries appear to consider the technique 
a viable way to receive a payout, demonstrating how 
ransomware actors are constantly working around 
advancements in EDR, law enforcement operations 
and other barriers.

While extortion has proven to be a serious and 
effective threat, it has not yet outpaced the 
ransomware threat that has been a challenge for 
organizations and defenders for the past several 
years. We are continuing to monitor the long\-term 
effects of this trend. 

Some ransomware groups 
consistently leverage zero\-
days, often affecting multiple 
organizations 

While many inexperienced adversaries relied on 
code reuse this year, we also continued to see 
highly sophisticated operators exploiting zero\-day 
vulnerabilities at an unprecedented pace, highlighting 
the broad technical diversity of actors and TTPs 
in this space. Ransomware actors, well\-known for 
being opportunistic, are quick to exploit flaws when 
made public. When Clop, a high\-profile ransomware

What is the impact of leaked 
ransomware source code?

When ransomware source code or builders are 
leaked, it becomes easier for aspiring cybercriminals 
who lack the technical expertise to develop their 
own ransomware variants by making only minor 
modifications to the original code. Additionally, by 
using leaked source code, threat actors can confuse 
or mislead investigators, as security professionals 
may be more likely to misattribute the activity to the 
wrong actor.

Ransomware and extortion

and data extortion group, claims public responsibility for exploiting 
a zero\-day vulnerability, additional ransomware affiliates quickly 
follow suit, scanning for affected systems before patches are issued 
(Figure 6\). 

In April, shortly after print management software company PaperCut 
became aware of unpatched servers being exploited in the wild by 
Clop, other ransomware groups began to exploit the critical remote 
code execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE\-2023\-27350\) as part of their 
attack chain. This highlights the widespread nature of this activity 
and ransomware operators’ strategy, often based on the disclosure 
of other groups leveraging high\-profile security flaws to increase 
chances of eliciting payouts from victims.

Clop’s repeated efforts to exploit zero\-day vulnerabilities is highly 
unusual for a ransomware group given the resources required to 
develop such capabilities. We saw many instances of this in 2023, 
beginning in January, when the Clop ransomware group launched 
a campaign leveraging a zero\-day vulnerability, (CVE\-2023\-0669\) 
to target the GoAnywhere MFT platform. In May, Clop claimed 
responsibility for attacks involving another zero\-day flaw (CVE\-
2023\-34362\) affecting Progress Software’s file transfer solution, 
MOVEit Transfer. These attacks also demonstrate Clop’s expanded 
toolkit, as the operators deployed a previously unseen web shell, 
dubbed LemurLoot, to exfiltrate victims’ data and extort payments 
on systems running MOVEit.

The vulnerabilities leveraged by ransomware affiliates/groups 
highlighted above all received high\- or critical\-severity CVSS scores, 
were found to be easily exploitable by Cisco Kenna, and were 
included in CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.

Given the resources required to develop or identify such exploits, 
it is possible that Clop, and/or certain members, possess a level of 
sophistication and funding matched only by APTs. There is no known 
chatter on underground forums about how Clop may have obtained 
these exploits, though we assess the group may have access to a 
sophisticated developer that appears to be focusing on identifying 
vulnerabilities in third\-party file management systems and other 
network peripherals.

Landscape shifts in the 
RaaS space due to law 
enforcement disruptions

Ransomware groups experienced disruptions, 
forcing them to adapt and/or join other RaaS 
outfits. In January 2023, the U.S. Justice 
Department announced it had disrupted the Hive 
ransomware group. By late January, we saw this 
reflected in our data, with a general dropoff in 
posts made to Hive’s data leak site (Figure 7\).

When ransomware infrastructure gets disrupted, 
operators often continue their work with other 
groups, creating a whack\-a\-mole scenario 
for law enforcement and network defenders. 
For example, when Hive’s infrastructure 
was disrupted, many former Hive members 
attempted to join other ransomware groups 
within days of the disruption, according to our 
sources. This greater democratization, with 
an influx of new groups leveraging code from 
the same ransomware builders, introduces 
complexities for defenders attributing activity 
to specific groups as TTPs remain consistent 
across groups.

T alos observed an increase in sophisticated attacks on 

networking devices this past year, particularly by state\-
sponsored actors seeking to advance espionage objectives 
and facilitate stealthy operations. Our investigations have largely 
involved threat groups affiliated with Russia and the People’s 
Republic of China (PRC), though it is reasonable to assume any 
sufficiently capable APT is, or will be, developing the capability 
to target network infrastructure as the success of these attacks 
garners increased attention. We have also recently observed 
targeting activity from other cybercriminals, including initial 
access brokers and ransomware actors seeking to profit off 
unauthorized access to targeted devices. 

Networking equipment is an attractive target for malicious 
cyber actors due to the large attack surface it presents and 
potential access to a victim network it can offer. Though 
these devices are key components of an organization’s IT 
infrastructure and often conduits of sensitive network traffic, 
they are infrequently examined from a security perspective 
and typically poorly patched. Further, they often do not run on 
standard operating systems, but rather custom firmware unique 
to the vendor, meaning they cannot be protected or monitored 
with standard, one\-size\-fits\-all security solutions. The 
dichotomy of high value and weak security in these devices 
makes them a prime target for exploitation. Because 
of the large presence of Cisco network infrastructure around 
the world, we are well\-positioned to investigate and report on 

top\-tier attackers and their campaigns. 

FIGURE 8

Exploitation attempts of network device CVEs released in 2022 or 2023

Weak security often 
exploited for initial access 

We have seen malicious actors predominately 
gain initial access to networking devices by 
exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities, weak 
or default credentials, or insecure device 
configurations. While security professionals 
may not be able to implement standard EDR 
solutions on networking devices as referenced 
above, this observation demonstrates that an 
organization’s defenses against this threat can be 
greatly improved simply through routine patching, 
enhanced monitoring, and improved credential 
management. Once initial access is obtained, 
threat actors will typically take further advantage 
of the device’s limited security by destroying 
evidence of an intrusion, such as wiping or 
disabling logs.

Exploitation of 
vulnerabilities spike 
after public disclosure

Over the last year, exploitation activity against 
vulnerabilities in network devices typically 
remained consistent, though sometimes spiked 
following public disclosure, based on our 
telemetry. A spike in exploitation attempts could 
be due to several factors, such as a singular and 
very large campaign conducted by an advanced 
threat actor, or widespread targeting activity 
that was suddenly impeded by highly publicized 
reporting and recommendations to patch. 
Comparatively, the consistent targeting levels in 
the months after disclosure suggests affected 
organizations are failing to patch their devices in 
a timely manner and actors therefore continue to 
see value in exploiting these older vulnerabilities 
even as they age. 

For example, detections for Snort IDs (SIDs) 
60726 and 60725, which alert on attempts to 
exploit the aforementioned Fortinet vulnerability 
(CVE\-2022\-40684\), spiked right after the security 
flaw was disclosed in mid\-October 2022, then 
significantly lowered to a consistent level in early 
2023 (Figure 8\). In comparison, attempts against 
vulnerable Zyxel devices (CVE\-2023\-28771; 
SID 6185\) began in mid\-May 2023, shortly after 
the CVE was publicized in April, and remained 
relatively level for months afterward.

2023YEAR IN REVIEWNetwork infrastructure

Top vulnerabilities targeted are highly critical, 
easily exploitable and widespread

The vulnerabilities affecting network devices that were 
most frequently targeted in 2023 have high severity 
scores, meaning they are easily exploitable and can cause 
significant operational impact. Of the five most targeted 
vulnerabilities in this space, three have a CVSS score 
of 9\.8 or 10, scores that are reserved for only a small 
number of the most serious CVEs. Exploitation of critical 
and severe security flaws in network devices can, in some 
instances, lead to full device takeover, allowing adversaries 
unfettered access to core components of a target’s 
network and security perimeter. 

Furthermore, many of the affected devices are widely 
used by enterprises and governments globally, further 
exacerbating the potential impact and scope of successful 
compromise. Threat actors may uncover thousands of 
vulnerable devices when conducting mass scanning after 
flaws are disclosed and can often find publicly available 
exploits as well. 

Finally, the variety of vendors represented in the list 
below demonstrates how universal this issue is for 
device providers. This is further supported by Russian 
intelligence contracting documents, also known as the 
Vulkan Files, that Talos obtained samples of this past 
year. These documents showed that any network device 
brand was vulnerable to targeting, with one scanning 
component targeting almost 20 different router and switch 
manufacturers. 

Most of the CVEs listed below are also included in CISA’s 
lists of vulnerabilities that are commonly targeted and/
or have known exploitation. Our top two vulnerabilities 
were also included in a CISA advisory on threats to U.S. 
critical infrastructure, demonstrating just how impactful 
exploitation of these vulnerabilities can be.

1\. CVE\-2020\-5902 (SID 54462\): A remote code execution vulnerability in F5 BIG\-IP’s Traffic Management user interface.

2\. CVE\-2019\-1653 (SID 48949\): An information disclosure vulnerability in Cisco RV series routers. 

3\. CVE\-2022\-40684 (SIDs 60725 and 60726\): An authentication bypass vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS, FortiProxy and 

FortiSwitchManager. 

4\. CVE\-2023\-28771 (SID 61865\): An unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in multiple Zyxel firewalls.

5\. CVE\-2020\-3452 (SID 54598\): A directory traversal vulnerability in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software 

and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.

from the Snort website. 

Malware sometimes 
installed post\-
compromise to establish 
footholds 

In some instances, we observed actors, 
particularly China\-affiliated APTs, installing 
malware onto devices post\-compromise 
to establish footholds in the network and 
enable follow\-on activity. Some of the 
capabilities enabled by the malware we 
have seen include:

• Bypassing access control lists 

(ACLs) so that traffic cannot be 
properly blocked by the router.

• Allowing for authenticated access 

to devices outside of normal 
authentication methods.

• Enabling the ability to corrupt and 

disable the device.

• Redirecting actor\-defined traffic 

to actor\-controlled infrastructure. 

In many instances, we see actors using 
living\-off\-the\-land binaries (LoLBins) 
either in conjunction with or instead of 
malware deployment to advance their 
operations and avoid detection. 

In a more recent instance of malware 
being installed post\-compromise, actors 
began exploiting a previously unknown 
critical vulnerability (CVE\-2023\-20198\) 
in September and October 2023 to gain 
access to certain network devices running 
Cisco’s IOS XE software. This allowed 
attackers to gain privilege level 15 access 
to the device, which they used to exploit a 
second zero\-day vulnerability (CVE\-2023\-
20273\) to deploy their malware.

Notably, the CVE\-2023\-20198 
vulnerability specifically affects devices 
that are exposed to the internet and 
have the HTTP or HTTPS Server function 
enabled, features the U.S. government 
had previously warned about.

This activity underscores Cisco’s 
recommendations, which are consistent 
with best practices and guidance the 
U.S. government has provided in the past 
on mitigating risk from internet\-exposed 
management interfaces. This is also in line 
with Cisco’s ongoing work with industry 
partners as part of the Network Resilience 
Coalition, covered in more detail below.

Collection of network information 
essential to high\-stakes operations 

Russian and Chinese APTs use their visibility into compromised 
devices to capture sensitive network information, facilitating 
further access to more valuable data. Actors seek to intercept 
and abuse data such as legitimate credentials, 
details of trusted domain relationships, network diagrams, 
contracts with network customers, and configuration information. 
This information can provide a roadmap for actors seeking to 
elevate their privileges and pivot into networks of interest for 
intelligence collection. 

APTs will also take steps to weaken defenses within the 
environment and carve out additional paths for long\-term 
access. These methods include disabling logging, modifying 
memory to reintroduce vulnerabilities that had been patched, 
modifying configurations to enable privileged activity and 
replacing firmware with older and legitimate firmware that can 
be modified in memory. This variety of activities demonstrates 
that adversaries have a very high level of comfort and expertise 
working within the confines of compromised networking 
equipment. Additionally, in establishing these footholds within a 
target environment, actors seek to erode the variable barriers 
in an organization’s defense\-in\-depth security architecture. 
Organizations must update and enhance their system hardening 
efforts and network monitoring capabilities to defend against 
these threat groups.

Numerous compromised devices 
form anonymizing network for 
malicious traffic 

While the techniques described thus far are typically highly 
specialized to target specific victims, actors also conduct 
widespread and indiscriminate targeting of network devices 
to facilitate stealthy operations against secondary targets. We 
have observed China\-affiliated APTs compromising numerous 
networking devices globally, with limited consideration of the 
device’s owner, to form an anonymizing network that functions 
similarly to Tor. The actors use this network of compromised 
devices to route malicious traffic to and from a targeted network, 
thereby obfuscating the origin of their attack. These APTs can 
also bypass a target’s security defenses that block traffic from 
certain geographic regions by having the C2 traffic emanate from 
internet service providers (ISPs) local to the victim. 

We have seen China\-affiliated actors conducting widespread 
campaigns to exploit critical vulnerabilities associated with 
networking devices within days of public disclosure, meaning the 
type of infrastructure targeted is often largely opportunistic.

How are we countering 
this growing threat? 

Cisco launched the Network Resilience Coalition with 
leading industry partners in July 2023\. This alliance 
focuses on increasing awareness of this issue, 
understanding its full scope, and providing actionable 
recommendations for improving network security that 
supports global economic and national security. 

Talos has led efforts to address this threat, 
contributing a significant amount of research and 
technical information that has been published in U.S. 
government advisories on this topic. We have also 
increased messaging to customers and network 
defenders on how to improve network infrastructure 
resilience. We actively engage in research and 
information sharing efforts with other vendors as 
well to bolster overall device security. For example, 
this past year, our Talos Vulnerability Discovery and 
Research Team made investigating small office, home 
office (SOHO) and industrial routers a major priority. 
As a direct result of this effort, we have reported 289 
vulnerabilities to vendors to date, published across 141 
Talos advisories. These reports resulted in new Snort 
network intrusion detection coverage and several 
security improvements from each vendor. These fixes 
help customers who deploy Cisco Security solutions 
and improve the security posture of anyone using 
these devices once the vulnerabilities are patched.

past year, predominately

Ransomware actors and initial 
access brokers abuse weak 
credentials and monetize access 

Initial access brokers and ransomware affiliates have 
also become more active in targeting network devices 
this past year, predominately compromising weak or 
default credentials, then either selling the unauthorized 
access on dark web marketplaces or using it to deploy 
ransomware onto targeted networks. 

This year, we responded to a campaign targeting Cisco 
Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) devices configured 
with WebVPN in which cybercriminals likely gained 
unauthorized access to the devices via brute force 
and password spraying attacks. In July, we observed 
a significant spike in activity targeting ASA devices 

configured with WebVPN, coinciding with much of the 
public reporting on in\-the\-wild activity targeting ASA 
devices (Figure 9\). Additionally, a September 2023 
spike in WebVPN requests coincides with Cisco’s 
security advisory on a vulnerability disclosure for CVE\-
2023\-20269\. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows a 
remote attacker to conduct brute\-force attacks or an 
authenticated, remote attacker to establish a clientless 
SSL VPN session with an unauthorized user. The ability to 
perform a brute\-force attack, combined with widespread 
use of weak or default credentials, facilitated high impact 
against a large number of devices. This activity also 
highlights the frequency in which adversaries will attempt 
to exploit vulnerabilities soon after they are made public.

Akira and LockBit ransomware groups were publicly 
tied to this activity starting in August 2023, though 

it is unclear if these actors conducted the credential 
spraying attacks or if they purchased access from initial 
access brokers. These two threat groups have also 
been observed conducting similar activity against other 
device vendors, such as FortiGuard. Talos believes that 
third\-party brokers may be responsible for initial access 
in many of the ransomware cases based on volume and 
timing of the targeting activity and nature of follow\-
on actions post\-compromise. The aforementioned 
security advisory included mitigation recommendations 
and indicators of compromise to help defenders 
protect against this threat, highlighting the importance 
of implementing proper MFA and limiting the number 
of consecutive failed login attempts, which would 
significantly reduce exposure to this threat.

persistent 
threats: China

Section highlights

• China\-affiliated activity occurred at a rigorous pace this year, likely in 

response to geopolitical events that strained the country’s relationships 
with the West and Asia Pacific. 

• Based on our analysis of numerous malicious campaigns, it appears 
Beijing may be directing more aggressive intelligence collection and 
prepositioning for future attacks against targets in these regions. 

• Actors have improved in terms of deeply entrenching themselves in 

targeted networks and dodging detection or incident response efforts, 
placing a heavier burden on targeted organizations to keep their 
networks safe. 

• Talos observed several instances of ransomware actors compromising 
a target closely following a long\-term, covert APT intrusion by using 
similar methods of initial access and deploying ransomware. While 
the connection, if any, between the APT and ransomware groups is 
undetermined, the timing of the operations and overlap in TTPs suggests 
the ransomware operators may at least have prior knowledge of the 
espionage campaigns. 

• Telecommunications organizations were a top target of Chinese cyber 
operations in 2023, particularly those offering services in areas of 
strategic interest to China, such as Guam and Taiwan. These entities are 
particularly attractive targets for these actors, as unauthorized access can 
enable widespread intelligence collection across several critical sectors. 

• The organizational structure of telecommunications organizations and 
victims’ geographical locations often poses challenges to incident 
responders, including limited visibility into all affected networks and 
political sensitivities when investigating or assigning attribution to China. 

While APTs emanating from many parts of the world remained active, most of our 
investigations and research this year focused on China, Russia and the Middle East, 
which are featured in this section of the report.

C hina\-linked APTs operated at a rapid pace this year, conducting sophisticated and stealthy 

actors responsible for these campaigns often seek long\-term access to targeted networks, 

intrusions into the networks of numerous high\-value targets. According to our research, the 

establishing multiple methods of maintaining persistence while avoiding targets’ detection mechanisms. 

TTPs largely centered on evading 
detection and attribution 

China\-affiliated APTs appear to considerably reduce 
their malicious activity on a network if detected or the 
actor becomes aware of incident response efforts. 
Operators are likely maintaining undiscovered footholds 
and waiting until the target is no longer operating at a 
level of heightened awareness to resume their activity, 
underscoring the importance of aggressive remediation 
and eviction efforts, and keeping incident response 
plans updated. Their success in maintaining this access 
is evidenced by long dwell times on compromised 
networks, with one intrusion we investigated this 
past year having a dwell time of at least seven years. 
This demonstrates the severe impact these types of 
campaigns can have on targeted organizations, as 
complete remediation often requires comprehensive 
analysis of all network assets, long\-term support of 
advanced incident response teams, and organization\-
wide action such as password resets and system 
updates. If targeted entities cannot commit to these 
response efforts, the malicious actors will likely quickly 
and quietly resume their activities once they sense the 
target feels the environment is safe. 

Other TTPs used by China\-linked APTs this past year 
include LoLBins to evade detection, exploitation of public 
vulnerabilities, targeting of network devices, and use of 
shared, open\-source or commercial tools, all of which 

are largely unchanged from last year. We also continued 
to see these APTs conducting operations in which 
access to the targeted entity can facilitate compromise 
of many victims, with actors especially employing this 
methodology against telecommunications organizations. 

New trend of ransomware 
deployment following long\-term 
espionage operations

In a few instances, following a long\-term, sophisticated 
and espionage\-oriented APT intrusion, Talos observed 
a secondary threat group targeting the victim network 
by using similar methods of gaining initial access, such 
as exploiting public\-facing vulnerabilities, and then 
deploying ransomware payloads. We have observed 
this trend in certain industries, such as semiconductors, 
and regions, such as Guam, that the PRC places a high 
degree of strategic importance on. Though we have 
yet to determine a connection, if any, between the two 
groups of attackers in these instances, several scenarios 
are possible:

• They could be illustrative of these APTs engaging in 
destructive attacks. There are several examples of 
Chinese APTs incorporating ransomware into their 
operations, such as Bronze Starlight or APT41\.

• They could be comprised of actors affiliated with the 
original attackers, such as opportunistic associates 

seeking financial gain.

• These groups may also not be affiliated with China at 
all, though this is probably less likely given the timing 
of the follow\-on ransomware operations and overlap 
in methods of obtaining initial access. 

Whether it has resulted from strategic collaboration, 
financial cooperation, or just unaffiliated actors finding 
their way in due to some other element, such as noisier 
tradecraft from the original adversaries, these attacks 
potentially represent a dangerous new destructive 
element to PRC\-affiliated APT attacks that we assess 
reveals an escalation from previous years. 

More rigorous pace of operations 
likely linked to shifts in 
geopolitical environment 

Activity conducted by China\-affiliated APTs occurred at a 
fast tempo this past year, likely due in part to geopolitical 
factors that Chinese leadership perceived as threats to 
the Communist Party of China’s (CCP’s) governance. We 
quantified this increase in activity based on the number 
of government partner intelligence shares, collaboration 
projects with CISA, related infrastructure targeting cases, 
and high\-priority investigations into China\-affiliated 
activity affecting Cisco customers.

This shift in tempo may reflect a difference in intent, a 
type of signaling we have not observed in years past. 
Beijing typically directs cyber activity with the intent of 
collecting intelligence to address the economic, political 
and strategic goals of the CCP. Though some of these 
goals, such as their Five\-Year Plans, are routinely set 
as long\-term objectives for growth, other provisional 
needs are determined based upon China’s relationships 
with other nations. For example, if a relationship with a 
nation China relies on for exports deteriorates, Chinese 

“Activity conducted by

and a half. Talos continues to

and private partners on hunting

actors may seek to exfiltrate proprietary data, 
focused on espionage yet deliberately quiet, 
that can boost their self\-reliance in developing 
whatever that export is. If a relationship with 
a nation becomes increasingly contentious, 
China may seek to establish footholds in the 
networks of that nation’s critical infrastructure 
and preposition themselves for future

Numerous geopolitical events affected China’s 
relationships with the West and Asia Pacific 
this year, potentially leading to CCP directives 
for more aggressive targeting activity. Talos 
performed intensive incident response 
operations for strategic targets in both of 
these regions. 

Deepening divide between 
China and the West

One major factor that has deepened the 
divide between China and the West this year 
has been the PRC’s alliance with Russia, 
particularly as other world leaders have 
vehemently denounced Moscow’s actions in 
the Russia\-Ukraine war. The two countries 
have strengthened their trade relationship, 
and China’s rapidly increasing exports to 
Russia have tempered the impact of numerous 
Western sanctions that have been levied 
against the country since its invasion of 
Ukraine. Russia and China have also united to 
expand their presence in the Middle East and 
developing countries, conducting joint military 
exercises in the Gulf of Oman in March 2023, 
and inviting numerous nations to join BRICS 
group in August 2023, bolstering the trade bloc 

against competition from the West.

U.S. policies and positions regarding China 
have not softened this year, with the U.S. 
continuing to categorize China as a top security 
threat. The Director of National Intelligence 
named China the “most consequential threat” 
to U.S. national security in 2023, and the 
U.S. has steadily expanded sanctions against 
Chinese companies and organizations because 
of such concerns. These security issues were 
exemplified by an incident in early 2023 when 
a Chinese spy balloon flew over the U.S., 
gathered intelligence from military bases, and 
transmitted the information back to Beijing 
before being shot down. The U.S., Japan and 
South Korea also bolstered their alliance in 
2023, with the countries’ leaders meeting at 
Camp David in August and committing to work 
together to address security challenges from 
China and North Korea. Beijing swiftly criticized 
this meeting, publicly stating attempts to form 
military blocs in the Asia Pacific will be met 
with “vigilance and opposition.” 

Growing conflict in the 
Asia Pacific

Meanwhile, China is already facing conflict 
with neighboring nations in the Asia Pacific. 
Tensions have been rising between China 
and Taiwan, exacerbated by U.S. support in 
expanding Taiwan’s self\-defense capabilities. 
The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has upped 
its military pressure on the island, routinely 
sending warplanes, drones and ships past 
the median line of the Taiwan Strait in shows 
of force. China has also become increasingly 

aggressive in the South China Sea, doubling 
down on their claims to sovereignty over 
almost all of the disputed area. Their robust 
military presence in the region has incurred 
standoffs and conflict throughout the past year 
with neighboring countries that have competing 
claims for the territory, as well as with the 
U.S. military that is present there. Finally, 
China’s relationship with Japan has also seen 
challenges in the past year, with events like 
Japan restricting exports of semiconductors 
and Tokyo’s decision to release water from the 
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which 
elicited criticism from Beijing. 

Targeting of the 
telecommunications 
sector expands collection 
and prepositions actors for 
future attacks 

We responded to several intrusions into 
telecommunications providers by China\-
affiliated APTs this year, particularly in areas 
that are of strategic interest to Beijing. 

Telecommunications organizations are 
attractive targets for these groups, as they 
often control numerous critical infrastructure 
assets in the country, such as national satellite 
systems, internet services, and telephone 
networks that are vital to the private and 
public sectors. China\-affiliated APTs can 
use their unauthorized access to establish 
footholds to disrupt critical services, such as 
communication infrastructure, in the event of a 
conflict with the targeted nation. They can also 

pivot into the networks of additional high\-value 
targets of interest and conduct widespread 
exfiltration of sensitive data. 

There are several ways in which use of this 
latter technique can challenge remediation 
efforts. A service provider may not immediately 
realize or have visibility into the extent of 
an intrusion targeting other businesses, 
subscribers or third\-party providers, giving 
the actors ample time to burrow themselves 
deeper into compromised networks. The 
guidance for notifying customers of a breach 
also varies by country, potentially delaying 
incident response based on the geographic 
location of the initial victim. Finally, given 
delicate diplomatic relations that may exist 
between the targeted country and adversary, 
U.S.\-based incident response teams may face 
challenges and political sensitivities when 
assisting in certain regions. Victims in certain 
countries may be hesitant to assign attribution 
to a particular threat group, could have strong 
organizational ties to China, and/or may be 
wary of sharing key details of the compromise 
with American teams.

persistent 
threats: Russia

Section highlights

• Russian state\-sponsored APT Gamaredon has remained a major player 
in threats against Ukraine and was the top threat that the Cisco Talos 
Ukraine Task Unit responded to this year. 

• 

In 2023, Gamaredon primarily targeted entities in North America and 
Europe, with a disproportionate number of victims in Western Europe. 
Additionally, over half of the entities targeted were in the transportation 
and utilities sectors, reflecting Russia’s focus on critical infrastructure. 

• Turla, another Russian government\-affiliated APT, was largely active 
between September 2022 and February 2023, but their operations 
diminished significantly around May 2023, coinciding with the U.S. Justice 
Department’s disruption of Turla’s Snake malware. 

• The number of affected sectors and volume of victims between these two 
groups vastly differed, contrasting Gamaredon’s broader targeting with 
Turla’s more limited activity against highly selective victims. 

• Beyond Gamaredon and Turla activity, we also observed a spike in 

SmokeLoader activity — malware used by a variety of different groups 
— in late April and early May, aligning with CERT\-UA’s reporting of mass 
distribution of SmokeLoader targeting Ukrainian entities. 

• To stabilize Ukraine’s power grid against the effects of global positioning 
system (GPS) jamming on the battlefield, Cisco hardware and software 
engineers modified one of our commercial network switches to provide 
holdover for Ukraine’s power grid equipment during these outages.

T hreats from Russian state\-sponsored or state\-aligned APTs remain a 

mainstay in our threat tracking and research efforts this year. Since the 

onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian APTs’ engagement in 

cyber espionage, cyber influence, and destructive attacks has intensified. In 

line with activity reported in last year’s report, Russian APTs continue to adapt 

to geopolitical challenges stemming from the war and NATO and allied nations’ 

military assistance to Ukraine. Additionally, 2023 saw a global law enforcement 

effort to dismantle the Snake malware, considered one of the most prolific 

and sophisticated cyber espionage tools in the Federal Security Service of 

the Russian Federation’s (FSB) arsenal commonly deployed against systems 

globally. 

Gamaredon and Turla 
remain top threats, 
targeting patterns vary

Russia\-affiliated APT groups Gamaredon and Turla 
continue to persist as top threats in this space, 
updating aspects of their attacks and toolkits to 
support their TTPs, despite international efforts to 
combat the Russian cyber threat. 

Cisco Talos closely tracks activities associated with 
Gamaredon, an APT broadly suspected to be a team 
of Russian government\-supported actors based 
in Crimea. While the group in recent months has 
concentrated their efforts on cyberespionage against 
Ukrainian entities, they also target entities globally, 
with a less focused victimology as compared to other 

Russian APTs operating in this space. Turla 
also conducts long\-term espionage and data 
exfiltration operations that are in line with Russian 
intelligence priorities that the U.S. government 
attributes to a unit within the FSB. In contrast to 
Gamaredon, who we observed targeting a range of 
sectors in 2023 (Figure 10\), Turla is known for much 
more targeted operations against a smaller number 
of strategically important entities. Turla, who is 
publicly assessed to operate on behalf of a different 
unit than Gamaredon in the FSB, is likely capable of 
compromising a much broader spectrum of entities 
worldwide but limits their operations to what they 
perceive to be high\-value targets. 

The number of sectors and volume of victims that 
Gamaredon and Turla targeted vastly differed, based 
on our telemetry (Figures 10 and 11\).

“Beyond highlighting the 
sectors that Gamaredon 
and Turla targeted this 
year, the data is also largely 
representative of the 
volume of attacks Snort 
helped prevent.”

The largest spread of Gamaredon victims were 
located in North America, followed by Europe 
and the Middle East, with a disproportionate 
number of victims in western Europe. Over half of 
Gamaredon’s targeting activity impacted the utilities 
and transportation industry sectors, consistent with 
Russia’s targeting of critical infrastructure entities, 
likely to cause the most disruption to strategic 
entities to stymie Ukraine’s war efforts. 

In September and December 2022 and September 
2023, we saw three clear spikes in Gamaredon 
activity (Figure 12\), potentially representing clusters 
of specific targeted operations. The ramped 
up Gamaredon activity as seen in Figure 12 in 

August 2023 is consistent with the group’s activity 
levels according to a report by Ukraine’s National 
Coordination Center for Cybersecurity (NCCC). 

In contrast to the range of industry verticals 
Gamaredon targeted this year, Turla targeted 
fewer victims across a smaller number of sectors 
and geographies, in line with the group’s precise 
operations. The manufacturing and financial services 
sectors were equally impacted, with education and 
agriculture targeted to a lesser degree (Figure 11\). 
Beyond highlighting the sectors that Gamaredon 
and Turla targeted this year, the data is also largely 
representative of the volume of attacks Snort 
helped prevent. 

Malware deployed by and custom to Turla, including 
various backdoors and implants used for persistent 
access, are seen to congregate in a series of events 
largely occurring between September 2022 and 
February 2023\. While the reason for the heightened 
activity during that period is unknown, we asses 
it is likely to have stemmed from an increased 
operational tempo in response to the Russian 
invasion on Ukraine. These four malware families — 
Gazer, Kazuar, Mosquito and Neptun — while not an 
exhaustive list of Turla malware, are part of Turla’s 
large arsenal of bespoke malware and modified 
open\-source malware, which are constantly updated 
or replaced with more advanced versions. 

This clustering over time, as seen in Figure 13, 
of custom Turla malware continues to convey the 
narrative of Turla’s operational tempo, likely highly 
based on the selectivity of targets. Notably, the 
depiction of Turla malware activity in Figure 13 
(while not an exhaustive list) diminishes significantly 
around May 2023, coinciding with the U.S. Justice 
Department’s disruption of Turla’s Snake malware. 
For nearly 20 years, Turla deployed Snake to steal 
and exfiltrate data from targeted systems through 
numerous relay nodes scattered around the world. 
While the effects of the Snake disruption on Turla’s 
current and future operations are still unknown, the 
diminished malware activity may represent changes 
in Turla’s toolkit as a result of the disruption.

Top five malicious activities affecting Ukraine partners

Internal Task Unit continues to 
monitor threats to Ukraine

Talos’ ongoing support for Ukraine continues to be a 
large focus of our operational efforts this year. As part 
of the Task Unit’s work, we monitor suspicious activity 
in endpoint telemetry for nearly three dozen Ukrainian 
partners across critical infrastructure sectors, including 
government, utilities, financial services, health care and 
transportation, among others. 

While the threats against these organizations may not 
all be designated as APT activity, the volume of threats 
and volatile geopolitical climate they are deployed in 
poses a significant risk to network defenders protecting 
critical assets.

Gamaredon is the most dominant threat to Ukraine 
that our task force has responded to (Figure 14\). The 
group has historically targeted predominantly Ukrainian 
entities — particularly those responsible for the 
country’s defense, diplomacy and internal security.

Gamaredon, and portions of their attack chain, 
consistently appear in top threat hunting alerts from 
Cisco Secure Endpoint that notified our Ukrainian 
partners (Figure 15\). For example, these top five 
behaviors demonstrate the consistent use of LoLBins 
and the techniques associated with them, such as 
Wscript execution — a legitimate Windows process 
likely used to masquerade malware deployment under 
the guise of expected activity — that continue to be 
leveraged to support a variety of threats across an 
attack lifecycle. Activity commonly linked to financially 
motivated cybercriminals, like the deployment of 
cryptocurrency mining and information stealers, also 
continue to impact Ukrainian organizations across 
numerous industries, speaking to the broad range of 
threats facing Ukraine.

defense resources we 
continue to devote to 
protecting our Ukrainian 
partners has undoubtedly 
had a significant impact 
on this threat space as 
well, thwarting significant 
disruptions by mitigating 
attacks in the early stages.”

Beyond highlighting the consistent tempo of 
Gamaredon activities above, Figures 14 and 15 
also help to demonstrate the multitude of threats 
the Task Unit has responded to this year. This 
includes activities from malware threats such 
as loaders, information stealers, ransomware, 
cryptocurrency miners and Raspberry Robin, 
a prolific malware family covered in last year’s 
annual report, which remains a consistent threat to 
enterprise environments. For example, SmokeLoader 
is a downloader leveraged by a variety of groups 

that the Task Unit has repeatedly responded to 
this year (Figure 14\). Typically delivered via email, 
SmokeLoader drops malware on infected machines 
and since early May, has been consistently reported 
by Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team 
(CERT\-UA) further highlighting its persistent use in 
the threat landscape. 

We observed a spike in SmokeLoader activity in 
late April and early May, aligning with CERT\-UA’s 
reporting of mass distribution of SmokeLoader 
targeting Ukrainian entities (Figure 16\).

While the Task Unit has continuously responded 
to a myriad of cyber threats since the onset of the 
Russia\-Ukraine war, the observed activity in 2023 
was far less sophisticated than what is typically 
associated with the sophisticated adversaries we 
would expect to see in this space. The activity 
was dynamic this year but does not reflect the 
full range of destructive cyber capabilities Russia 
has previously demonstrated against Ukraine and/
or its NATO allies. The reasons behind this have 
been debated by industry partners and experts, 

and it is likely the result of combined efforts from 
the cybersecurity industry, U.S. government, 
foreign partners, and Ukraine’s own commitment to 
protecting its people. The significant cyber defense 
resources we continue to devote to protecting our 
Ukrainian partners has undoubtedly had a significant 
impact on this threat space as well, thwarting 
significant disruptions by mitigating attacks in the 
early stages.

Project PowerUp: Keeping 
the lights on in Ukraine

Leveraging Talos’ unique relationships with industry, 
government, and Ukraine, we spearheaded an effort to 
help stabilize Ukraine’s power grid against the effects of 
GPS jamming on the battlefield. 

Faced with the complex problem of how to make 
Ukraine’s substations resistant to operational failures 
caused by downed GPS signals, Cisco hardware and 
software engineers modified one of our commercial 
network switches, the Cisco Industrial Ethernet switch, 
to provide holdover for Ukraine’s power grid equipment 
during these outages.

After months of development and coordination with 
various partners, the devices were delivered to Ukraine 
and installed in substations around the country, no small 
feat during an active war zone. This story will be featured 
in Cisco’s annual Purpose Report later this year. This 
example further demonstrates how Cisco’s efforts have 
helped safeguard Ukraine’s critical infrastructure from 
severe Russian cyberattacks in 2023\.

How is Ukraine’s 
power grid 
affected when 
GPS goes down?

Many of Ukraine’s high\-voltage 
electrical substations — which 
play a vital role in the country’s 
domestic transmission of 
power — make extensive use 
of the availability of precise 
GPS timing information to 
help operators anticipate, 
react and diagnose a complex 
high\-voltage electric grid. 
When GPS signals are 
widely disrupted, substations 
cannot synchronize their time 
reporting accurately because 
they cannot assign accurate 
timestamps. Without good 
synchronized data, efforts 
to manage loads between 
different parts of the system 
can be affected, and this 
management avoids outages 
and failure, especially during 
peak demand and surge 
times. This disruption can be 
widespread, causing wide 
areas to lose GPS service for 
long periods of time.

YoroTrooper threat actor matrix

Some YoroTrooper 
members hail from 
pro\-Russia Kazakhstan

Earlier this year, Cisco Talos disclosed information 
on a new threat actor we named “YoroTrooper,” 
who we assess with high confidence consists, 
at least in part, of individuals from Kazakhstan. 
YoroTrooper is a highly motivated threat actor 
whose low sophistication is complemented with 
aggressive targeting of entities using a multitude of 
commodity malware families. Since 2022, the group 
has conducted operations aimed at espionage and 
data theft against victims in the government or 
energy sectors in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan 
and other members of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS).

APT activity from Russian allies

Talos’ research and monitoring efforts of regional threats have 
expanded to APT activity attributed to countries formerly part of 
the Soviet Union, whose intelligence goals, TTPs and victimology 
often align with the Kremlin. Given the long\-standing political 
union between these governments, collaboration is plausible. 
However, we do not have direct evidence of Russian government 
involvement.

We assess YoroTrooper also targets organizations of strategic 
value across European and Turkish governments (Figure 17\). For 
example, YoroTrooper has compromised accounts for at least 
two international organizations, including a critical European 

Union (EU) health care agency and the World Intellectual 
Property Organization (WIPO). Successful compromises also 
included embassies of European countries including Azerbaijan 
and Turkmenistan. 

This year, Talos has also been monitoring GhostWriter operational 
activities, which is a group allegedly linked to the Belarusian 
government, according to CERT\-UA. We have observed several 
GhostWriter campaigns against government entities, military 
organizations and civilian users in Ukraine and Poland. We judge 
that these operations, often seen promoting anti\-NATO narratives 
that aim to undermine regional security cooperation, are very 
likely aimed at stealing information and gaining persistent remote 

access. Recent activities, also tracked by CERT\-UA, demonstrate 
the group’s exploitation of the WinRAR ZIP parsing vulnerability, 
CVE\-2023\-38831\. The vulnerability allows attackers to hide 
malicious code in ZIP archives masquerading as popular file 
formats including JPG or TXT files, which GhostWriter 
leveraged to deploy Cobalt Strike and the malware 
downloader, PicassoLoader.

We cannot rule out Russian contributions to YoroTrooper 
or GhostWriter at this time. These operations and targeting 
patterns, often strongly aligning with Russian strategic interests, 
are key for understanding regional threats against the backdrop 
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

• Events in early October 2023 between Hamas and Israel contributed to 
several politically motivated hacktivist groups launching uncoordinated

• The Middle East’s complicated geopolitical environment continued to 

be dynamic this year, and we will likely see that impact the cyber realm 
going forward. As longtime regional adversaries attempt to normalize ties, 
and decades\-old conflicts spark new violence, major cyber players with 
economic and political interests in the Middle East, like China and Iran, 
may be more motivated to influence outcomes through direct or proxy 
operations. 

• Middle East\-based APT groups targeted telecommunications firms in the 
region, following the trend we have seen of sophisticated adversaries 
targeting this sector. As part of this activity, we identified a new intrusion 
set, ShroudedSnooper, deploying novel implants we dubbed HTTPSnoop 
and PipeSnoop against related entities. 

• The Iran state\-sponsored MuddyWater APT group relied less on 

the commonly used Syncro tool — essential for remote access and 
malware deployment — than in previous years, likely in response to the 
cybersecurity industry’s action against known MuddyWater TTPs.

R egional state\-sponsored groups continue to conduct 

Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Telecommunications 

pervasive cyber attacks against entities in North America, 

companies endured the most of these attacks, a trend that 

has transcended multiple APTs, as outlined in other parts of 

this report. Our work in this space resulted in the discovery of 

a new actor we named ShroudedSnooper that appears intent 

on targeting major telecommunications entities in the region. 

The Iran state\-sponsored MuddyWater APT actor remains a 

key player in this threat space and was the focus of much of 

our research efforts this year. While the group continues to use 

many of the same techniques to advance their primary goals of 

stealing intellectual property and collecting intelligence, industry 

action has likely influenced the group’s ability to use certain tools, 

including the Syncro remote management and monitoring (RMM) 

platform that the group was using at the end of 2022\.

The Middle East is arguably the most complicated geopolitical 

region in the world, and the conflict that ignited between Hamas 

and Israel in October 2023 reminds us that events with global 

consequences can unfold quickly and with little notice. The 

everchanging geopolitical landscape here will undoubtedly affect 

cyber activity going forward, as established regional players like 

Iran remain intent on achieving certain geopolitical goals and new 

actors like China seek to expand its influence. 

Hamas\-Israel conflict brings 
influx of hacktivist groups

Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel in October not only 
had global implications but also has affected the 
cyber realm, immediately drawing in actors from both 
sides of the conflict. Politically motivated hacktivist 
groups — including well\-known actors like Killnet and 
Anonymous Sudan as well as lesser\-known groups — 
launched uncoordinated and mostly unsophisticated 
attacks at the outset, as the threat space was quickly 
flooded with many different actors. Several hacktivist 
groups quickly announced support for both sides in 
the Israel\-Hamas conflict, posted threatening political 
messages, called on followers to join in and claimed 
responsibility for DDoS attacks against targets of 
interest — typical hacktivist TTPs. This is broadly 
consistent with what we observed at the start of the 
Russia\-Ukraine war, when an influx of cyber activity 
became concentrated on these countries 
seemingly overnight.

Significant geopolitical events like this also invite the 
participation of much more sophisticated adversaries, 
including those supported and funded by foreign 
state governments. We have seen this most recently 
in Ukraine, where advanced state\-sponsored actors 
from Russia like Gamaredon and Turla have been 
relentless in their targeting of Ukranian entities since 
the start of the war. Likewise, we expect to see an 
increase in Iranian cyber activity in the Middle East 
following Hamas’ attack on Israel. Iran and Israel 
are longstanding adversaries, and their decades\-
old conflict has major influence on Iran’s cyber 
operations. Iran is also a key backer of several 
anti\-Israel militant and terrorist groups, including 
Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, 
which were all involved in this most recent spate 
of violence against Israel. Iran’s support for these 
groups and Tehran’s historical hostility with Israel 
strongly suggests Iran may use its cyber capabilities 
to influence the outcome of the crisis, much like other 
nations rely on cyber as an essential tool to advance 
foreign policy objectives.

“The Iran state\-sponsored MuddyWater APT actor remains a key player 
in this threat space and was the focus of much of our research efforts

Chinese ambitions 
in the region portend possible 
cyber operations

While China has traditionally held a prominent economic role 
in the Middle East as one of the largest foreign investors, 
PRC leadership sought to also expand their political 
presence in the region this past year by engaging in regional 
conflict mediation. In March, Beijing brokered an agreement 
between longtime adversaries Iran and Saudi Arabia to 
reestablish diplomatic ties, and in September, China and Syria 
announced a strategic partnership, as Syrian President Bashar 
Assad begins to reenter the international fold after more than 
a decade of brutal civil war. The China\-Syria deal may also 
provide great economic incentives for Beijing, which could 
become a major financial backer of Syria’s reconstruction 
efforts. These strategic moves by China come at a time when 
the U.S. has largely withdrawn from the region following the 
post\-9/11 period, and Beijing likely sees this as an opportunity 
to capitalize on waning U.S. involvement and influence there.

Because of China’s growing political presence in the 
Middle East, we expect to see more Chinese APT activity 
in the region. We have observed Chinese APTs, among 
the most active and persistent of state\-sponsored threats, 
supplementing financial endeavors with espionage 
operations in regions it is invested in, targeting private sector 
organizations and governments whose intellectual property 
aligns with economic goals. Future operations would likely 
be in\-line with well\-established Chinese APT TTPs, like 
targeting entities and individuals that operate in industries 
essential to China’s strategic plans, establishing long\-term 
and stealthy access to targeted networks, and stealing 
intellectual property and technology.

telecommunication firms. OfficeTrack is an application 
promoted as a workforce management solution 
developed by OfficeCore, a software company 
that helps users manage administrative tasks. In 
several instances, we saw URLs ending in “lbs” and 
“LbsAdmin,” references to the application’s former 
name (OfficeCore’s LBS System) before it was 
rebranded to OfficeTrack (Figure 18\). 

Throughout our analysis of the ShroudedSnooper 
implants, the adversary used multiple URLs consisting 
of patterns mimicking provisioning services from 
telecommunications companies, including an Israeli 
telecommunications provider, likely to blend into 
typical network traffic. The DLL\-based variants of 
HTTPSnoop usually rely on DLL hijacking in benign 
applications and services to get activated on the 
infected system, which was highlighted as a top 
technique this year in earlier sections of this report. 

Telecommunications sector 
remains key target for regional 
threat actors

In 2023, we discovered a new intrusion set, 
ShroudedSnooper, deploying novel backdoor 
implants, HTTPSnoop and PipeSnoop, against 
telecommunications providers in the Middle East, 
a continuation of a trend we have been monitoring 
in which sophisticated actors frequently target this 
sector. There is currently not enough evidence to 
link ShroudedSnooper activity to a specific country. 
However, the group’s consistent masquerading of 
software applications used by telecommunication 
firms in the region and impact to several regional 
providers highly aligns with likely state\-sponsored 
actors and sophisticated adversaries around 
the world.

The HTTPSnoop and PipeSnoop implants consist of 
novel techniques to listen to incoming requests for 
specific HTTP(S) URLs and execute on an infected

Industry actions likely affected 
MuddyWater operations

In late 2022, it was first reported that Iranian\-backed APT group 
MuddyWater was using the Syncro remote management tool to take 
over target devices. This activity is consistent with Talos IR data from 
Q4 2022 (October \- December 2022\), where a growing number of 
adversaries were increasingly relying on Syncro, observed in nearly 30 
percent of engagements.

In December 2022, Syncro released a statement addressing concerns 
about MuddyWater’s deployment of Syncro in spear phishing 
campaigns targeting organizations in the Middle East and Asia. The 
company implemented additional verification measures for new trial 
account creation to limit the use of Syncro by illegitimate actors, and 
monitored for irregular account information and usage, terminating 
accounts that violate these new policies.

This swift action taken by Syncro most certainly has had an impact 
on MuddyWater operations, highlighting the direct effect industry can 
have on thwarting components of advanced adversaries’ operations. 
While the reason for Syncro’s increased usage in Q4 2022 was 
unknown, its use as a fully featured remote access platform for 
managed service providers (MSPs) and its ubiquity across enterprise 
environments likely made it an attractive option. 

“This swift action taken by Syncro most 
certainly has had an impact on MuddyWater 
operations, highlighting the direct effect 
industry can have on thwarting components 
of advanced adversaries’ operations.”

Syncro leveraged to 
maintain access

In an incident affecting a 
telecommunications company, 
Talos IR identified company email 
accounts sending phishing emails 
with subject lines that translated 
from Arabic to “Staff Promotion.” 
The emails contained OneDrive 
and OneHub phishing links with a 
compressed Microsoft Windows 
Installer (MSI) file that installed 
Syncro. The adversary used 
Syncro to stay connected to 
the targeted user’s workstation. 
During analysis of the MSI 
file, multiple Syncro services 
were also installed, including 
SyncroRecovery (SyncroLive) and 
SyncroOvermind. The adversary’s 
tactics appeared to focus on

installation of Syncro. The lack 
of MFA for email access allowed 
the adversary to perform phishing 
attacks, highlighting the need 
to ensure MFA across all critical 
assets.

2023YEAR IN REVIEWCommodity 
loaders

Section highlights

• Commodity loaders such as Qakbot, Ursnif, Emotet, Trickbot and IcedID 
represent some of the most impactful and pervasive threats, as actors 
routinely rely on them to enable key parts of their operations. Their use 
as downloaders for information\-stealers, ransomware, and other malware 
have made them mainstays in the threat environment, indiscriminately 
affecting entities globally. 

• All these loaders formerly functioned solely as banking trojans, and 

developers have diversified their capabilities in recent years to support 
more advanced operations. In 2023, new versions of IcedID, Ursnif, and 
Qakbot appeared to be tailored specifically for ransomware actors, based 
on their enhanced reconnaissance features, removal of functions that 
might trigger antivirus detections, and quick adoption by ransomware 
groups and initial access brokers. 

• Microsoft’s disabling of macros by default caused commodity loader 

actors to invent new ways to use macros undetected or avoid using them 
entirely. Qakbot operators used a wide variety of file types, scripting 
languages, packers, and exploits to deploy the loader. Emotet, IcedID, 
and Ursnif varied their techniques, although less frequently compared to 
Qakbot, and also tended to still rely on older TTPs. 

• 

It can be challenging to eradicate the threat of commodity loaders 
even after the botnet is dismantled, as developers have been known to 
continue operating on behalf of different malware groups or rebuild their 
botnets. Furthermore, previously compromised infrastructure could be 
leveraged by other threat actors for malicious activity.

phases of an attack. Throughout 2023, Qakbot, 

Ursnif, Emotet, Trickbot and IcedID stood out as 

the most impactful threats in this space.

Commodity loaders’ updates seem 
tailored to support ransomware activity

In late 2023, we observed the latest variants of IcedID and Ursnif, 
and a new automated feature in Qakbot, supporting ransomware 
deployment, following a trend of commodity loaders playing an 
integral part in the ransomware infection chain. These updates 
were tailored to enhance the malware’s dropper functionalities, 
likely signifying a further shift away from their original intended use 
as banking trojans. Trickbot and Emotet are also known to facilitate 
ransomware attacks, however, they did not receive similar upgrades 
in 2023\. 

In November 2022 and February 2023, IcedID developers released 
two new versions that were stripped of their banking functionalities 
and designed to solely function as droppers. In 2023, these versions, 
dubbed “Forked” and “Lite,” were used by initial access brokers, 
known for commonly selling network accesses to ransomware groups. 
While the original version was also used by initial access brokers and 
ransomware groups, the new versions are likely a more attractive 
option because they were stripped of functions that might trigger AV 
signatures, thereby making them stealthier. IcedID activity increased 

between November 2022 and February 2023—
corresponding with the new versions’ release—
suggesting actors were keenly interested in trying 
out the threat’s latest capabilities (Figure 19\).

The latest Ursnif variant, which was similarly 
retooled to exclude banking trojan functionality, 
was also seemingly intended to support 
ransomware deployment. In 2023, this updated 
version (released in 2022\) was adopted by 
the prolific ransomware group Royal, the first 
instance of any ransomware gang incorporating 
Ursnif into their operations. Since Royal is the 
only group that has been observed leveraging 
this new variant, there may be a professional 
association between the developers. Royal is a 

group of sophisticated cyber criminals first active 
in September 2022, and suspected by many 
security professionals to be a rebrand of the 
prolific Russian ransomware group Conti. Royal 
tightly controls their malware and ransomware 
operations, unlike many other ransomware 
groups that arose in the last two years who 
chose to operate as a RaaS. Therefore, an 
exclusive partnering of the new Ursnif variant 
and Royal is likely intentional and could imply an 
affiliation between the developers. 

Finally, in late 2022, Qakbot deployed several 
new automated features, including a capability 
ideally suited to helping ransomware groups 
determine valuable targets prior to deployment. 

The updates included a list of reconnaissance 
commands to map out the customer’s 
environment upon initial infection. The output of 
these commands enumerated data that would 
be most useful to ransomware groups, including 
domain groups, the domain name, and names 
of domain controllers. This information could 
assist with lateral movement resulting in Active 
Directory takeover, a tactic commonly used by 
ransomware groups. Qakbot’s new automated 
reconnaissance capabilities also may have 
helped ransomware groups evade detection, 
because the gathered data could be used to 
formulate a detailed plan of attack, minimizing the 
time between initial infection and encryption.

2023YEAR IN REVIEWCommodity loaders

Commodity loader operators evolved 
TTPs in response to new security 
updates blocking macros, continuing 
a trend that began in mid\-2022

In 2023, Microsoft blocked macros by default, a notable change 
that caused actors to modify their initial access and malware 
delivery techniques. Prior to the change, macros would run 
automatically when Microsoft Office documents were opened. 
Macros have been heavily abused by threat actors to execute 

malware automatically when a victim clicks on a malicious 
attachment in a phishing email. Now, the user receives a security 
warning if they click on a potentially malicious attachment, 
reducing the likelihood of downloading malware. Microsoft’s 
disabling of macros continued to have an impact throughout 
2023, as threat actors invented new ways to use macros 
undetected, or to avoid using macros entirely. When Microsoft 
created a new patch to update security features, threat actors 
were able to quickly change their TTPs in a game of cat\-and\-
mouse (Figure 20\).

Sample reconnaissance 
commands we observed 
deployed by Qakbot 
affiliates in 2023

Threat actors conduct reconnaissance to gather 
information for additional operations. We observed 
Qakbot affiliates abusing common Windows utilities 
that allow for command execution in an attempt to 
hide among legitimate activity. Below are just a few 
examples to demonstrate the potential harmful impact 
of these commands.

Netstat \-nao: Used to obtain a list of open ports that 
are particularly vulnerable to malicious attacks and a 
list of active connections between the infected host 
and other systems, such as a cloud environment, to 
determine whether the victim can access data that is 
of value to the threat actor.

Net localgroup: Used to identify administrator 
accounts (i.e., accounts with elevated privileges that 
can access sensitive data and make changes to the 
system). This information helps a threat actor know 
which accounts to prioritize in their targeting efforts. 

Arp \-a: Used to display the ARP cache, a record 
of each IP address and its corresponding MAC 
address that made a connection to the infected 
host. With this information, an attacker can position 
themselves between the communication of two or 
more networked devices to steal additional data or 
manipulate transmitted data.

2023YEAR IN REVIEWCommodity loaders

In a trend that began in 2022 and continued throughout 2023, adversaries using 
commodity loaders repeatedly changed their TTPs in response to new Microsoft security 
updates. In November 2022, Microsoft issued two patches to detect and block macros\-
enabled content within container files, such as ZIP and LNK, which had been a popular 
method for surreptitiously using macros. Just a few weeks later, we observed a surge 
in threat actors, including those using Qakbot, Emotet and IcedID using OneNote file 
attachments to deploy malware. While using OneNote to deliver malware was not a new 
technique, it facilitated delivery of macros\-enabled documents without being detected, 
which is highly favorable among affiliates wishing to bypass AV detection (Figure 21\).

Then in January, Microsoft quietly issued an update, so all macros\-enabled documents 
embedded within OneNote files would be blocked by default, meaning the user would 
receive a security warning when opening a OneNote attachment embedded with macros. 
We still saw threat actors using OneNote, but with crafty social engineering techniques 
that manipulated victims into ignoring the warnings. In one observed campaign deploying 
IcedID, the threat actor used a DocuSign lure to trick the victim into clicking a button with 
an embedded link. The “Decrypt and View Message” button actually contained a malicious 
HTML Application (HTA) file (Figure 22\). When opened, the HTA file was dropped into the 
OneNote directory for execution.

Finally, in April 2023, Microsoft issued another update 
that blocked users from opening files with a potentially 
dangerous extension embedded in OneNote. To open an 
attachment marked as potentially dangerous, OneNote 
users would need to save the file to their device and open 
it from there, allowing security applications running on the 
device to detect any malicious code in the attachment. This 
latest update caused many operators to abandon OneNote 
as a method to hide the use of macros. Instead, we 
observed actors turning to filetypes that execute malware 
without relying on macros, such as JavaScript files which 
rely on LoLBins for execution (Figure 23\). 

Aside from OneNote, threat actors also experimented with 
other methods of deploying malware that did not rely on 
macros or could use macros without detection. Since at 
least December 2022, we have observed threat actors co\-
opting the Google Ads platform to deploy malware such 
as Ursnif, IcedID, and Trickbot, a method that completely 
avoids using macros. The attack chain in these campaigns 
begins with a user entering a search term for a software 
or service in the Google search engine. Once Google’s 
results page loads, the malicious ads will typically be first in 
the list of results, as the actors have been observed using 

search engine optimization (SEO) to increase visibility. If 
the user clicks on the malicious ad, a Google Ad services 
URL will be generated, which then generates a secondary 
URL that leads the user to the malicious, spoofed domain 
with download links that deliver the various threats. Talos 
observed legitimate software products spoofed in these 
campaigns, such as Microsoft Teams and WhatsApp, and 
popular password managers like 1Password. Threat actors’ 
use of Google Ads and Google Search makes their lures 
appear highly legitimate, as users are probably less likely to 
question the authenticity of paid advertisements prioritized 
at the top of their search results.

While many affiliates introduced new TTPs in 2023 in 
response to evolving security updates, we also observed 
commodity loaders using older methods. For example, 
Emotet, IcedID, and Ursnif were all observed using macros\-
enabled Office documents in the initial infection chain. 
Furthermore, we observed Emotet being delivered in 
phishing emails with old “RedDawn” templates first seen in 
2020 (Figure 24\). While these operators may be capable 
of more sophisticated attacks, it’s possible they have 
still found success using older TTPs, especially against 
unpatched, enterprise legacy systems.

World map of regions impacted by commodity, from most to least targeted

Commodity loaders

Top five commodity 
loaders are similarly 
deployed against 
sectors globally in 
mass opportunistic 
campaigns

In 2023, we observed all five commodity 
loaders impacting businesses worldwide, 
primarily affecting North America and 
Europe (Figure 25\). These geographical 
targets do not necessarily reflect a 
coordinated preference among operators 
because the threats are sold as a 
malware\-as\-a\-service (MaaS). Therefore, 
patterns in targeting are aligned with 
whatever group is executing the campaign 
and can vary. 

We predominantly observed mass 
spam campaigns that opportunistically 
attempted to compromise vulnerable 
targets, likely with the intent to move 
laterally towards a more hardened target 
after the initial infection. Adversaries 

will typically tailor phishing lures for the 
targeted geography. For example, in 
2023, we observed Ursnif predominantly 
deployed against businesses located 
in the U.S. and Italy in mass “spray 
and pray” spam campaigns using the 
languages of the targeted countries.

We have observed loaders primarily 
deployed against businesses, as opposed 
to targeting individuals’ financial data, a 
shift that occurred as the malware was 
less frequently used as banking trojans. 
This is reflected in the phishing lures we 
observed. For example, in late\-March, 
we saw an uptick in Emotet targeting U.S. 
businesses that pay quarterly taxes. The 
lures used themes related to the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) with subject lines 
such as “IRS Tax Forms W\-9,” which 
was also seen last year at the end of 
the November 2022 business quarter. 
W\-9 forms are typically distributed by 
companies or financial institutions to 
their employees.

FIGURE 26

Trickbot activity over time

Threats from commodity 
loaders can persist 
long after their botnets 
are dismantled 

In August 2023, the prolific Qakbot commodity 
loader was disrupted in a major global law 
enforcement operation, but dismantling 
botnet infrastructure does not always mean 
cybercriminals cease to operate. Going forward, 
it’s possible Qakbot may reemerge after a 
several\-month hiatus — as we have seen in similar 
scenarios involving other loaders like Emotet — 
further underscoring the need to monitor and 
report on this threat. Notably, the threat actors 
behind Qakbot were not apprehended during the 
global takedown, and our latest findings indicate 

they are still active—albeit delivering different 
threats – leaving open the possibility that they 
rebuilt the Qakbot botnet or rebrand themselves 
under a different name. 

We have seen other malware developers 
also continuing to operate in the cyber threat 
landscape after their botnets were dismantled. 
For example, even after Trickbot took down its 
infrastructure in February 2022, the U.S. and UK 
still sanctioned the developers in February and 
September 2023, implying they are still active 
in the cyber threat landscape. The developers 
may have chosen to create other types of 
malware, or work with other groups they have 
had longstanding relations with, such as Emotet 
and Conti. In 2022, a series of leaks revealed 
close professional relations between developers 
of Trickbot and Conti and in 2021, Trickbot lent 

portions of its infrastructure to help rebuild the 
Emotet botnet.

in the charts above by a more dramatic spike or 
irregular patterns.

Even if threat actors opt to cease cybercriminal 
activity, we may still observe zombie activity from 
infected Qakbot devices. We have seen this from 
Trickbot, where our telemetry picked up activity 
throughout 2023 even though their infrastructure 
was dismantled in February 2022\. This is 
likely due to old infections that have yet to be 
remediated or threat actors leveraging previously 
compromised infrastructure. Looking at Trickbot 
activity over the past year, we can see it hovered 
around the same median number, supporting our 
assessment that the botnet is still active in some 
capacity, but the developers are not actively 
engaged in growing the botnet (Figure 26\). 
Any new campaigns or infrastructure, such as 
IPs or C2 servers, would likely be represented 

Meanwhile there are always new commodity 
loaders to replace formerly prolific botnets like 
Qakbot and Trickbot. For example, IcedID may 
be a logical choice to fill the void left by Qakbot. 
There is a historical precedence, as IcedID 
attracted affiliates after Emotet was dismantled 
in 2021\. Furthermore, many Qakbot affiliates 
are likely already familiar with IcedID because 
there are numerous instances of the two being 
deployed together as part of the same campaign. 
Finally, the recent advanced IcedID update shows 
the developers are capable of, and motivated to, 
maintain a high\-quality product.
