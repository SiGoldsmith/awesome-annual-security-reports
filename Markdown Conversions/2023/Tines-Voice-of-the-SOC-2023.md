## A word from Eoin Hinchy
2
Before founding Tines, I spent 15 years in 
the SOC leading teams charged with 
protecting organizations from ever-evolving 
threats. Over that time, the challenge facing 
SOC analysts became harder, not easier: 
workloads are increasing, but teams aren’t 
growing alongside them. SOC analysts are 
burning out as a result of tedious and 
repetitive tasks. In the best-case scenario, 
staff will leave in search of new opportunities 
and leave their previous organizations 
scrambling to replace them. In the worst case, 
their burnout will lead to human error that 
could cost a company millions.
Last year, we examined these issues in detail 
in our first “Voice of the SOC Analyst” report. 
Our survey found that while SOC teams were 
passionate and engaged in what they do, 
they were plagued by endless manual tasks, 
inefficient processes, and overwhelming alert 
fatigue — all preventing them from focusing 
on high-impact work. The same holds true 
in 2023.
For the second edition of the “Voice of the 
SOC,” Tines surveyed 900 security 
professionals. We expanded the scope 
beyond the United States to include Europe 
and sought perspectives from security 
leaders up to and including the C-suite, rather 
than just analysts.
Like many, security teams have felt the added 
pressure of economic instability over the past 
12 months. They were asked to do more with 
less, as business leaders scrutinized every line 
on the balance sheet.
This year’s data reveals that overall job 
satisfaction in the SOC remains high — 
security practitioners love the work they do. 
However, burnout is taking its toll. Leaders 
continue to feel their teams are understaffed 
and don’t have access to the tools that could 
automate the most mundane aspects of their 
work. The bottom line: more than half of 
respondents, across job levels, say they’re 
likely to switch jobs in the coming year.
This should be an alarm bell to business 
leaders. With both cyberattacks and skill 
shortages increasing, staff retention in the 
SOC is mission critical. The following report 
digs into the factors that undermine morale 
and offers practical solutions to help alleviate 
burnout and empower staff to do their 
best work.
We hope you find it useful in your SOC in 2023 
and as you plan for 2024.

## Key findings
3
Here are a few of the insights we learned from 
the security professionals we surveyed:
#1
63% of practitioners experience 
some level of burnout.
With more than 80% saying their workloads 
have increased in the past year, the problem is 
only getting worse.
#2
55% say they’re likely to switch jobs 
in the next year.
Organizations could increase retention by 
increasing salaries, supplying modern tools 
with advanced capabilities, hiring more staff, 
and investing in solutions that automate 
tedious, manual tasks.
#3
Spending time on manual work is the 
most frustrating aspect of the job.
If respondents had to spend less time on 
manual tasks, they would most likely use that 
time to research and evaluate new tools, 
develop more advanced detection rules, and 
integrate more systems and logs.
#4
There’s hope in 
automation.
Nine out of ten security teams are automating 
at least some of their work, and 93% of 
respondents believe that more automation 
would improve their work-life balance. 
Respondents expect automation to help their 
teams increase productivity, save time, and 
optimize performance and reliability.
#5
Security practitioners are 
learning to code.
Security teams now consider learning to code 
— along with computer forensics and malware 
analysis techniques — most important to 
succeed, likely because of coding’s key role in 
automation. No-code security solutions could 
provide similar benefits as organizations 
automate repetitive tasks.

Methodology and  
participant demographics
Tines surveyed 900 full-time security professionals from companies with 
200 or more employees. Nearly half (46%) work at companies with more than 
1,000 employees. There were 500 U.S. respondents, along with 100 each 
from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Benelux, and the Nordic region. The survey 
was conducted online by Sago (https://sago.com/), a research panel 
company, in May and June 2023.

## Job satisfaction and workloads

Chapter 1
Job satisfaction 
and workloads
Security teams enjoy the work they do and feel 
appreciated by the organization. But all is not well in 
the SOC — burnout and understaffing threaten 
stability and security. To better understand how 
leaders can fix the challenges at play, we first must 
take stock of how security teams are feeling today.

Chapter 1 • Job satisfaction and workloads
7
99% are satisfied with 
their job
Overall job satisfaction is up among 
security teams this year. The number of 
respondents satisfied with their current 
job rose from 88% last year to 99% in 
2023. 54% are very satisfied this year.

98% are engaged with 
their work
Analysts aren’t just satisfied — they’re 
locked in. 50% of respondents are very 
engaged with their work, and 98% are 
at least somewhat engaged.

99% feel respected by their 
peers outside the SOC
Security teams may sometimes feel like 
they are working in the shadows as they 
defend their organizations against 
threats, but their hard work does not go 
unnoticed. Almost all (99%) of 
respondents said they feel respected by 
their peers outside of the SOC team, 
and 52% feel very respected.

Chapter 1 • Job satisfaction and workloads
8
63% are experiencing some 
level of burnout at work
Despite 99% saying they’re satisfied 
with their job, nearly two thirds (63%) of 
respondents said they feel burned out 
at work. One in five feel very burned out. 
We’ll uncover some of the reasons for 
this shortly, along with ways to help SOC 
teams join the 37% who say they do not 
feel burned out at work.

50% say their SOC team is 
understaffed
Half of our respondents said their team 
is currently understaffed, and staffing 
problems are tied closely to burnout. Of 
those who felt understaffed, nearly four 
in five (79%) are burned out, compared 
to just 47% of those who felt they 
currently have the right amount of staff 
for their needs.

For 81%, workloads have 
increased over the past year
One of the reasons for burnout could be 
that 81% had more work than ever over 
the past year. This was particularly true 
in the United States, where 39% said 
their workload had increased 
substantially, compared to 22% in 
Europe. Just 2% of overall respondents 
said their workload had decreased.

SOC teams love what they do. The majority of 
respondents report feeling satisfied with their 
jobs, engaged in their work, and respected by 
their colleagues in other departments. They 
also indicated they are paid what they 
deserve, with 96% feeling fairly compensated.
However, 63% are experiencing some level of 
burnout at work, and many security teams 
feel understaffed and overburdened by ever-
increasing workloads. These issues can lead 
to employee churn, even among those who 
love their jobs. In the next sections, we’ll take 
a closer look at the factors that have helped 
retain respondents who would otherwise look 
for new opportunities.

Where  
time goes
We know security teams are frustrated by time 
spent on tedious tasks, and this repetitive work 
prevents them from engaging in the improvements 
that will enhance their organization’s security 
posture. In this section, we find out exactly what 
these necessary but mundane tasks are, and learn 
more about the internal metrics guiding this time 
management.

Top five time- 
consuming tasks
18%
Security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR)
The number one most time-consuming task is SOAR, likely because 
nearly every current SOAR tool uses an app-based integration model 
which relies on limited pre-built integrations and often requires teams 
to build their own custom apps. Direct integrations can address these 
challenges.
17%
Troubleshooting system errors/system maintenance
Troubleshooting and maintenance take up a significant amount of 
time, preventing teams from doing the proactive work that could 
improve security postures.
16%
Intelligence (i.e. researching threat actors, TTPs, ATT&CK)
Teams are also spending time researching threat actors — including 
their tactics, techniques, and procedures — and operationalizing the 
MITRE ATT&CK framework.
15%
Monitoring
Respondents are spending valuable time monitoring for threats and 
alerts, despite the fact that respondents over the practitioner level 
should not be doing front-line monitoring.
15%
Managing a knowledge base/operational documentation
Documentation rounds out the top five tasks — ensuring all essential 
documents are stored, backed up, and eventually discarded when 
they’re no longer needed.
Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

phone, messenger, etc)

[Image description: Bar graph showing top tasks security teams enjoy the least: Communicating (email, phone, Slack, etc.) (18%), Reporting (18%), Monitoring (10%), Responding to security incidents (10%), Triaging (9%), Threat hunting (9%), Tracking (8%), Intrusion detection (6%), Detecting (6%), Operations/ShiftOps (6%)]
Top four tasks security  
teams enjoy the least
18%
Communicating (email, phone, Slack, etc.)
One of the two tasks which respondents enjoyed the least was 
communicating. Slack notifications come for us all, but there are ways 
to automate communications internally and externally and increase 
transparency on shared projects.
18%
Reporting
The other top choice was reporting. Reporting matters, but it’s reactive 
— collecting what happened after an incident — rather than proactive. 
Streamlining the reporting process through automation frees up 
security practitioners to focus on analysis and increases job 
satisfaction.
10%
Monitoring
Monitoring, one of the most time-consuming tasks, is also one of the 
least enjoyable. Much of this type of manual front-line monitoring can 
be automated.
10%
Responding to security incidents
As you’ll see below, teams are judged on their ability to respond to 
incidents. It should be noted that 14% of respondents named this type of 
response their most enjoyable task — including 22% of VPs and above, 
suggesting a split between analysts and leaders on the task.

Top four key metrics used to 
measure job performance
What key metrics are used to measure a 
security team’s job performance? In other 
words, what metrics should SOC teams 
prioritize to improve team performance?
When we asked this question last year, the 
top five responses were mean time to 
investigate (54.1%), number of alerts (43.8%), 
mean time to respond (40%), time to detect 
(37.6%), and number of incidents handled 
(34.2%). Four of those answers cracked the 
top five again this year, with only the 
number of alerts falling off — possibly 
because security teams are learning that an 
avalanche of alerts is an impediment to 
success, not a marker of it.
36%
Mean time to investigate (MTTI)
The average amount of time between when a problem is 
detected and when the security team begins to investigate it. 
Successful SOC teams reduce the intervening window.
36%
Time to detect
The time it takes an organization to discover an incident. SOC 
teams need solutions in place to identify issues quickly and 
catch zero-day vulnerabilities.
36%
Number of incidents handled
SOC teams are measured by the amount of incidents they 
resolve successfully. They can slash this figure by implementing 
faster and more thorough alert and resolution tools.
36%
Mean time to respond
The average time it takes to resolve an incident completely. 
Automation can help security teams investigate and remediate 
threats and return a system to operation after a failure.

Where you can find them
As a fun aside, we asked our participants which conferences they’re aware 
of or have attended in the past two years. If you’re looking for your peers, 
your best bet is AWS re:Inforce, followed by Black Hat and AWS re:Invent.

Our respondents reveal that their time is mostly spent on necessary but tedious 
tasks like operating imperfect SOAR tools, troubleshooting system errors, and front-
line monitoring (which is also one of the tasks they enjoy least). Effective automation 
can help maximize a SOC team’s time and improve the metrics — including time to 
detect, investigate, and respond — that they are measured against.

Lack of time, budget, and 
effective tools are inhibiting 
SOC teams
Overall, what prevents the SOC team from doing their best work? In a word: 
resources. Our respondents, selecting all that applied, said a lack of time 
(42%) was the top factor holding them back, followed by lack of budget 
(39%), lack of effective tools (39%), and lack of people (35%).

SOC teams identified three clear challenges 
preventing them from doing their best work: 
too much data, too many tedious tasks, and 
too many reporting requirements. These pain 
points are amplified by a lack of time, budget, 
tools, and people.
Automation offers a path forward for security 
leaders to remove obstacles and refocus their 
teams on proactive, high-impact work. No-
code tools can help teams catch up quickly, 
keeping their organizations safe and possibly 
keeping their teams intact as well.

Automation —  
friend or foe
Business leaders are focused on streamlining 
processes and achieving operational efficiencies. 
They’ve found an effective way to do so in 
automation. But how do they feel about 
automation? Are they embracing the technology?
Nearly all security teams have already adopted 
automation to some extent. This is especially true in 
Ireland, where 44% of respondents said much of 
their work is automated, the highest percentage 
among the countries we surveyed.
