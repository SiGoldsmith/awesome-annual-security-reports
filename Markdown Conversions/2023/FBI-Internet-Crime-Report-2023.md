Dear Reader, 

Today’s cyber landscape is threatened by a multitude of malicious actors who have the tools to conduct large\-scale fraud 
schemes, hold our money and data for ransom, and endanger our national security. Profit\-driven cybercriminals and 
nation\-state adversaries alike have the capability to paralyze entire school systems, police departments, healthcare facilities, 
and individual private sector entities. The FBI continues to combat this evolving cyber threat. Our strategy focuses on 
building strong partnerships with the private sector; removing threats from US networks; pulling back the cloak of anonymity 
many of these actors hide behind; and hitting cybercriminals where it hurts: their wallets, including their virtual wallets. 

Critical to the FBI’s efforts is the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3\). IC3 gives the public a direct way to report cybercrime 
to the FBI and enables us to collect data, advance investigations, and identify changes in the threat landscape. In 2023, IC3 
received a record number of complaints from the American public: 880,418 complaints were registered, with potential 
losses exceeding $12\.5 billion. This is a nearly 10% increase in complaints received, and it represents a 22% increase in losses 
suffered, compared to 2022\. As impressive as these figures appear, we know they are conservative regarding cybercrime in 
2023\. Consider that when the FBI recently infiltrated the Hive ransomware group’s infrastructure, we found that only about 
20% of Hive’s victims reported to law enforcement. More reporting from victims would mean superior insight for the FBI. 

The past year, investment fraud was once again the costliest type of crime tracked by IC3\. Losses to investment scams rose 
from $3\.31 billion in 2022 to $4\.57 billion in 2023—a 38% increase. The second\-costliest type of crime was business e\-mail 
compromise (BEC), with 21,489 complaints amounting to $2\.9 billion in reported losses. Tech support scams, meanwhile, 
were the third\-costliest type of crime tracked by IC3\. Notably, different age groups tended to be impacted by different 
crimes. Victims 30 to 49 years old were the most likely group to report losses from investment fraud, while the elderly 
accounted for well over half of losses to tech support scams. 

In 2023, ransomware incidents continued to be impactful and costly. After a brief downturn in 2022, ransomware incidents 
were again on the rise with over 2,825 complaints. This represents an increase of 18% from 2022\. Reported losses rose 74%, 
from $34\.3 million to $59\.6 million. Cybercriminals continue to adjust their tactics, and the FBI has observed emerging 
ransomware trends, such as the deployment of multiple ransomware variants against the same victim and the use of 
data\-destruction tactics to increase pressure on victims to negotiate. 

Last year also saw notable achievements for law enforcement. The FBI’s commitment to assisting cyber victims and fostering 
partnerships allowed for the continued success of IC3’s Recovery Asset Team (RAT). Established in 2018, RAT streamlines 
communications with financial institutions and FBI field offices to facilitate the freezing of funds for victims. In 2023, IC3’s 
RAT initiated the Financial Fraud Kill Chain (FFKC) on 3,008 incidents, with potential losses of $758\.05 million. A monetary 
hold was placed on $538\.39 million, representing a success rate of 71%. 

As the cyber threat continues to evolve, the FBI remains appreciative of those who report cyber incidents to IC3\. Information 
reported to the FBI helps advance our investigations. Your reporting is critical for our efforts to pursue adversaries, share 
intelligence with our partners, and protect your fellow citizens. Cybersecurity is the ultimate team sport, and we are in this 
fight together. The FBI is committed to fostering greater security in a digitally connected world, and we are eager to work 
with the American public to defeat cyber adversaries and bring criminals to justice.

Today’s FBI is an intelligence\-driven and threat focused national security organization with both intelligence 
and law enforcement responsibilities. We are focused on protecting the American people from terrorism, 
espionage, cyber\-attacks, and major criminal threats which are increasingly emanating from our digitally 
connected world. To do that, the FBI leverages the IC3 as a mechanism to gather intelligence on internet 
crime so that we can provide the public and our many partners with information, services, support, training, 
and leadership to stay ahead of the threat. 

The IC3 was established in May 2000 to receive complaints crossing the spectrum of cyber matters, to 
include online fraud in its many forms including Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) matters, Computer 
Intrusions (Hacking), Economic Espionage (Theft of Trade Secrets), Online Extortion, International Money 
Laundering, Identity Theft, and a growing list of Internet\-facilitated crimes. As of December 31, 2023, the 
IC3 has received over eight million complaints. The IC3’s mission is to provide the public and our partners 
with a reliable and convenient reporting mechanism to submit information concerning suspected cyber\-
enabled criminal activity and to develop effective alliances with law enforcement and industry partners to 
help those who report. Information is analyzed and disseminated for investigative and intelligence 
purposes for law enforcement and public awareness. 

The information submitted to the IC3 can be impactful in the individual complaints, but it is most impactful 
in the aggregate. That is, when the individual complaints are combined with other data, it allows the FBI to 
connect complaints, investigate reported crimes, track trends and threats, and, in some cases, even freeze 
stolen funds. Just as importantly, the IC3 shares reports of crime throughout its vast network of FBI field 
offices and law enforcement partners, strengthening our nation’s collective response both locally and 
nationally. 

To promote public awareness and as part of its prevention mission, the IC3 aggregates the submitted data 
and produces an annual report on the trends impacting the public as well as routinely providing intelligence 
reports about trends. The success of these efforts is directly related to the quality of the data submitted by 
the public through the www.ic3\.gov interface. Their efforts help the IC3, and the FBI better protect their 
fellow citizens.

The Internet Crime Complaint Center’s Recovery Asset Team (RAT) was established in February 2018 to 
streamline communication with financial institutions and assist FBI field offices with the freezing of funds 
for those who made transfers to domestic accounts under fraudulent pretenses. 

 RAT Process5 

\* If criteria are met, transaction details are forwarded to the identified point of contact at the recipient 
bank to notify of fraudulent activity and request freezing of the account. Once response is received 
from the recipient bank, RAT contacts the appropriate FBI field office(s). 

The RAT functions as a liaison between law enforcement and financial institutions supporting statistical and 
investigative analysis. 

Goals of RAT\-Financial Institution Partnership 

• Assist in the identification of potentially fraudulent accounts across the sector. 

• Remain at the forefront of emerging trends among financial fraud schemes. 

• Foster a symbiotic relationship in which information is appropriately shared. 

Guidance for Complainants who send Wire Transfers 

• Contact the originating financial institution as soon as fraud is recognized to request a recall or 

reversal and a Hold Harmless Letter or Letter of Indemnity. 

• File a detailed complaint with www.ic3\.gov. It is vital the complaint contain all required data in 

provided fields, including banking information. 

• Never make any payment changes without verifying the change with the intended recipient; verify 

email addresses are accurate when checking email on a cell phone or other mobile device.

The IC3 RAT has proven to be a valuable resource for field offices and victims. The following are two 
examples of the RAT’s successful contributions to investigative and recovery efforts: 

New York 
In March of 2023, the IC3 received a complaint filed by a critical infrastructure construction project entity 
located in New York, New York area of a $50,000,000 loss due to a BEC incident. The RAT immediately sent 
the Financial Fraud Kill Chain (FFKC) request to the recipient financial institution and was advised that 
$44,936,460 was frozen in the account. Second\-hop information was provided by the recipient financial 
institution, and the RAT pursued the secondary wires to two additional recipient financial institutions. FFKC 
responses from the second wires reported a frozen amount of an additional $1,008,526\. 

Connecticut 
In March 2023, the IC3 received a complaint filed by an individual located in the Stamford, Connecticut 
area of a BEC related to a real estate transaction. The individual was in the process of purchasing a home 
and received a spoofed email from their supposed attorney instructing them to wire $426,000\.00 to a 
financial institution to finalize the closing. Two days after the wire was initiated, it was realized the 
instructions came from a spoofed email. Upon notification, the IC3 RAT immediately initiated the FFKC 
process to freeze the fraudulent recipient financial bank account. Collaboration with the domestic recipient 
financial institution and the local police department confirmed $425,000\.00 was frozen and returned to 
the individual which enabled them to complete the real estate transaction.

2023 OVERVIEW 

B U S I N E S S E MA I L C OMP R OM I S E (B E C ) 

In 2023, the IC3 received 21,489 BEC complaints with adjusted losses over 2\.9 billion. BEC 
is a sophisticated scam targeting both businesses and individuals performing transfers of 
funds. The scam is frequently carried out when a subject compromises legitimate business 
email accounts through social engineering or computer intrusion techniques to conduct 
unauthorized transfers of funds. 

These BEC schemes historically involved compromised vendor emails, requests for W\-2 information, 
targeting of the real estate sector, and fraudulent requests for large amounts of gift cards. More recently, 
the IC3 data suggests fraudsters are increasingly using custodial accounts held at financial institutions for 
cryptocurrency exchanges or third\-party payment processors, or having targeted individuals send funds 
directly to these platforms where funds are quickly dispersed. 

With these increased tactics of funds going directly to cryptocurrency platforms and third\-party payment 
processors or through a custodial account held at a financial institution, it emphasizes the importance of 
leveraging two\-factor or multi\-factor authentication as an additional security layer. Procedures should be 
put in place to verify payments and purchase requests outside of email communication and can include 
direct phone calls but to a known verified number and not relying on information or phone numbers 
included in the email communication. Other best practices include carefully examining the email address, 
URL, and spelling used in any correspondence and not clicking on anything in an unsolicited email or text 
message asking you to update or verify account information.

In 2023, the IC3 received 2,825 complaints identified as ransomware with adjusted losses 
of more than $59\.6 million. Ransomware is a type of malicious software, or malware, that 
encrypts data on a computer, making it unusable. In addition to encrypting the network, 
the cyber\-criminal will often steal data off the system and hold that data hostage until the 
ransom is paid. If the ransom is not paid, the entity’s data remains unavailable. 

Ransomware and Critical Infrastructure Sectors 

The IC3 received 1,193 complaints from organizations belonging to a critical infrastructure sector that were 
affected by a ransomware attack. Of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors, IC3 reporting indicated 14 sectors 
had at least 1 member that fell to a ransomware attack in 2023\.9

Incident reporting 

Ransomware infections impact individual users and businesses regardless of size or industry by causing 
service disruptions, financial loss, and in some cases, permanent loss of valuable data. While ransomware 
infection statistics are often highlighted in the media and by computer security companies, it has been 
challenging for the FBI to ascertain the true number of ransomware victims as many infections go 
unreported to law enforcement. By reporting the incident, the FBI may be able to provide information on 
decryption, recover stolen data, possibly seize/recover ransom payments, and gain insight on adversary 
tactics. Ultimately, the information you provide will lead us to bring the perpetrators to justice. 

The FBI does not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may embolden adversaries 
to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of 
ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not guarantee that an entity’s files 
will be recovered. Regardless of whether you or your organization decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges 
you to report ransomware incidents to the IC3\. Doing so provides investigators with the critical information 
they need to track ransomware attackers, hold them accountable under U.S. law, and prevent future 
attacks.

Call centers overwhelmingly

experience 58% of the losses (over $770 million). 

Investigative Success Stories 
FBI Knoxville Cyber Squad: The initial complaint received from IC3 spearheaded the investigation by 
identifying the main subjects, Ankur Khemani, and the Sterks, a family based in Iowa. Khemani and his co\-
conspirators duped thousands of victims into believing their computers were infected with malicious 
malware. The resulting investigation grew from 50 initial IC3 reports to over 14,000 victims with over $4 
million in losses. On September 28, 2023, Khemani was sentenced in Knoxville federal court to 75 months 
for orchestrating a fraudulent computer technical support ring based in India. On December 20, 2023, 
Marilyn Sterk, along with her daughter Teresa Sterk, and daughter\-in\-law Jennifer Sterk, were sentenced 
in Knoxville federal court for their involvement in a tech support scheme. The Sterks opened over 30 bank 
accounts to launder money obtained from victims of an India\-based tech support scam. Marilyn was 
sentenced to 30 months in prison, while her daughters received three years of probation. 

FBI, Legat New Delhi, Washington Field: Since 2022, the DOJ, the FBI Legal Attaché New Delhi, the 
Washington Field Office (WFO), and IC3 have collaborated with law enforcement in India, such as the 
Central Bureau of Investigation in New Delhi and local Indian states, to combat cyber\-enabled financial 
crimes and transnational call center fraud. In 2023, Indian law enforcement accomplished multiple call 
center raids, disruptions, seizures, and arrests of the individuals alleged to be involved in perpetrating these 
crimes. The FBI enabled 26 arrests through 13 joint operations with Indian authorities. WFO conducted 
hundreds of interviews and continues to support Indian law enforcement efforts and prosecution of call 
centers perpetrating these frauds.

\*Regarding ransomware adjusted losses, this number does not include estimates of lost business, time, wages, 
files, or equipment, or any third\-party remediation services acquired by an entity. In some cases, entities do not 
report any loss amount to the FBI, thereby creating an artificially low overall ransomware loss rate. Lastly, the 
number only represents what entities report to the FBI via the IC3 and does not account for the entity direct 
reporting to FBI field offices/agents.
