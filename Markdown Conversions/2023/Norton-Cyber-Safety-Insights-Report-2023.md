The research was conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of 
Gen among 8,022 adults (aged 18+) in 8 countries. The survey was 
conducted November 29 – December 19, 2022 in Australia (n=1,006), 
France (n=1,002), Germany (n=1,000), India (n=1,000), Japan (n=1,005), 
New Zealand (n=1,003), the United Kingdom (n=1,005), and the United 
States (n=1,001).

Data are weighted where necessary to bring them in line with their actual 
proportions in the population; India was weighted to the population of 
those who are online. Weighted variables varied by country and included 
one or more of the following: age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, 
education, marital status, internet usage, household size, household 
income, size of place, and propensity to be online. A global post-weight was 
applied to ensure equal weight of each country in the global total.

Throughout the report, references to YOY changes represent differences in 
results from the 2022 Global NCSIR Study, conducted online by the Harris 
Poll on behalf of Gen among 10,003 adults aged 18+ in 10 countries from 
November 15 – December 7, 2021.

Population projection estimates cited are calculated based on adult 
population (age 18+) figures from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2023 
International Data Base and Pew Research Center 2019 Global Attitudes 
Survey.

All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, 
are subject to other multiple sources of error which are most often not 
possible to quantify or estimate, including, but not limited to coverage 
error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question 
wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments.

Cybercrime and cybercrime attempts are a serious threat, 
with an estimated 463 million** adults in 8 countries* 
experiencing cybercrime in the past 12 months. These 
incidences cost victims money and valuable time. We estimate 
that among those who have experienced cybercrime in the 
past year, over 3.5 billion** hours were spent trying to resolve 
the issues created.
