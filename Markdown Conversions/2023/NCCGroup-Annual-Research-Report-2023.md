The big cybersecurity challenges for the next 5\-10 
years relate to ever\-evolving technology and threat 
landscapes, and the need for agility to keep pace in 
line with these evolutions against the backdrop of a 
volatile geopolitical landscape. Research has never 
been more important to help us in our endeavor to 
achieve security and resilience in these times.

On a technology level, legacy IT systems and 
maintenance of software patches remain a key challenge. 
Organizations are currently in mixed states of security 
posture in terms of legacy equipment and cloud migration 
and adoption. Many of the security promises of cloud 
haven’t been met (or understood), meaning that even 
cloud systems can and do suffer from legacy issues such 
as out of support, potentially vulnerable components. 
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) intrusions and 
Ransomware outbreaks routinely exploit legacy or 
unpatched systems for their gain, thus there is still much 
to do in terms of mitigating risk around legacy, noting that 
the new technologies of today, will also become legacy 
in 5 or 10 years’ time, therein establishing legacy IT as a 
permanent challenge for cybersecurity. 

While APTs are a huge threat to organizations and 
the global economy, the reality is that in terms of 
impact, ransomware is a much more pressing and 
damaging threat. A key challenge here is how to 
ensure organizations remain resilient in the face of a 
ransomware outbreak, since even a fully patched, cyber 
mature organization could be subject to a sophisticated 
ransomware attack exploiting a 0\-day vulnerability. 

AI and Machine Learning is already proving a challenge in 
terms of the requirement to gain a robust understanding 

of their relative opportunities and threats. The sudden 
accessibility of performant Large Language Models 
(LLMs) like ChatGPT in 2022 took most sectors, 
cybersecurity included, by surprise. There are already 
several potential negative impacts of LLMs in terms of 
cyber security, the security of the models themselves in 
how they are created and understanding how and why 
they produce their outputs. There is also concern for 
how and where and by whom LLMs are used – perhaps 
in generating source code for malware, or attack 
methodologies that make it easier for less technical 
individuals to perform offensive cyber activities. There 
are also big challenges in the realm of misinformation 
and, with related commoditized capabilities like 
Deepfakes, the emerging threat of Identity Compromise 
to support fraudulent activities – certainly, the industry 
is already seeing a natural evolution and sophistication 
of misinformation and targeted phishing campaigns 
leveraging these capabilities. 

The growing use of AI as a security control also presents 
a huge challenge – the efficacy of such solutions 
demands robust testing, evaluation and assurance, lest 
we become too trusting of automated decision making 
in security governance that we believe to be optimal 
but in fact may be silently rendering our systems more 
vulnerable. 

It is possible we will see Quantum Supremacy in our 
lifetime, meaning there is a burgeoning challenge in 
preparing businesses for Post\-Quantum Cryptography 
(PQC). While the preparation requirements and PQC 
algorithms are broadly understood, ensuring a worldwide 
migration to robust PQC presents a challenging 
undertaking. 

Related to quantum is the need to manage the threat 
model of classical computing integration with quantum 
components. The traditional vulnerabilities in classical 
computing will inevitably present potential for adversary 
exploitation to gain unauthorized access to quantum 
computing resources. There are also challenges in 
needing to understand and assure applications of 
quantum computing to cryptographic processes, namely 
Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) for 
seeding cryptographic material, and Quantum Key 
Distribution (QKD) for managing cryptographic keys and 
exchange. 

Despite their challenges, the technologies discussed 
above can be seen as the foundations and backbone 
for the broader concept of the connected society or 
connected world. Exponentially, this concept increases 
the attack surface of global economies, as seen through 
Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Cities and Connected 
Places, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles to name but 
a few. These application areas also move us rapidly into 
the cyber\-physical domain, meaning the cyber challenges 
here are not only impacting on a security level, but also 
safety, whereby the effects of compromise of some 
systems could lead to environmental impact, physical 
harm or worst\-case loss of life.

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research Report

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research ReportContinuously evolving technology and threat landscapes 
is why research is at the heart of what we do at NCC 
Group. Our global team of researchers routinely tackle 
many of these topics and themes to understand risk and 
remediation across all technologies in all sectors. This 
report sets out just some of the research insights from our 
broad research program over the past couple of years. 
The research doesn’t stop however, and we’re already 
embracing the research challenges of 2024 and beyond...

“
“

Fueled by the COVID\-19 pandemic push for increased 
home working, we have inadvertently lost the concept of 
the ‘network perimeter’, but also legitimized this through 
concepts such as Zero Trust networks. This brings huge 
challenges around the need to authenticate and authorize 
directly connected Internet users and machines in trusted, 
secure and reliable ways. 

Supply chain and sovereignty also pose challenges in the 
present and near future. Lack of trust in supply chains 
and countries of manufacture has led to a strategic 
goal for many developed economies to increase their 
sovereign capabilities and therefore reduce reliance 
on global manufacturing hubs. Challenges here mostly 
relate to funding and skillsets required to demonstrate 
that countries have their own secure capabilities that can 
deliver in this space.

There is also a broader research challenge relating 
to horizon scanning and knowing how and where to 
prioritize security advice and guidance on technologies 
in terms of their likely adoption. Examples we can expect 
to see in the next 10 years include Brain Computer 
Interfaces (BCIs), the Metaverse and its associated VR/
AR technologies, increased space\-based telecoms, 
neuromorphic computing and synthetic biology to name 
but a few – understanding the security capabilities and 
issues with these technologies will require vast amounts 
of research. 

“
“

Finally, yet crucially, there is a fundamental research 
challenge around energy use in the face of an energy 
crisis and climate change. There are estimates that 
21% of the world’s overall energy usage by 2030 will be 
computing power alone, yet technologies in AI, Cloud 
and Quantum are inherently power\-hungry. We therefore 
need to be incredibly mindful of, and proactive in the 
development of secure, power\-efficient and sustainable 
technical solutions for the technologies and systems that 
we will create and use over the coming decade.

In our increasingly digital world, the first indication of a 
security breach often emerges only after the damage 
has been done, leaving individuals and organizations 
to grapple with the aftermath. For the average person, 
without a security team to monitor their network and 
devices, the assumption is often made that regulatory 
safeguards would prevent the release of vulnerable 
products into the market. This assumption, however, can 
prove to be a significant risk. 

Take for example the pervasive world of white\-labelled 
products, particularly in everyday technology. As shown 
from many of our research outputs from the past couple 
of years, these cost\-effective, ubiquitous products are 
not always synonymous with security. Repeatedly, our 
research on white\-labelled products, like home routers 
and IoT devices, reveals that they have little to no security 
assurance or onward maintenance by manufacturers. 
They never receive crucial firmware updates or security 
patches, thus rendering them vulnerable and exposing 
users and consumers to a myriad of risks. The rise of 
Bluetooth technology in security\-critical applications, such 
as car key unlocking systems, further highlights this issue 
which doesn’t necessarily correlate with ‘cheap’ products 
and services alone \- despite Bluetooth’s own guidance on 
the limitations of its security features, the trend persists, 
as seen through our research demonstrating remote 
keyless attacks to gain entry to, and drive off with Tesla 
motorcars (a premium product) as just one example. 

This unseen vulnerability represents the Achilles heel 
of cybersecurity. Proactive security measures, regular 
check\-ups, and a comprehensive understanding of the 
limitations of our technology through continued research 
and innovation are not merely best practices; they are 
essential pillars of a robust cybersecurity strategy. 

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research Report

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research ReportAI \& Machine Learning

In the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity, the domain 
of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) 
security research has emerged as a paramount focal 
point. As AI/ML systems become deeply integrated 
into the very fabric of our society, influencing sectors 
from healthcare to finance, and from transportation to 
communication, their security and safety cannot be 
understated. Ensuring the robustness of these systems is 
not merely a technical necessity but a societal imperative. 
With AI playing an ever\-impacting role in decision\-making 
processes, personal interactions, and infrastructure, 
researching its security contours is critical to safeguarding 
the trust and wellbeing of individuals and institutions that 
increasingly rely on it. Unsurprisingly, AI/ML research 
at NCC Group has grown exponentially since 2022, as 
we continue to grasp the security and safety strengths 
and limitations of these powerful capabilities. Key 
observations from our AI/ML research since 2022 were:

• Potential and Pitfalls of AI/ML: The transformative 

power of AI and ML in cybersecurity is clear, but 
so are the associated risks and challenges 

• 

Impersonation and Privacy Concerns: AI’s 
capability to mimic human interactions can 
lead to serious privacy concerns, especially in 
community\-driven platforms 

• ML in Malware Analysis: ML significantly 

enhances malware detection but is not immune 
to challenges like adversarial attacks 

• Security Implications in ML Systems: Adversarial 
attacks, data poisoning, and model extraction are 
major concerns in ML security

• 

 Large Language Models (LLMs): Their power and 
potential come with challenges around overfitting 
and data reproduction 

• Human Oversight: Despite AI’s capabilities, 
human expertise remains paramount in 
cybersecurity tasks, from code review to threat 
detection 

Potential and Pitfalls of AI/ML 

Jon Renshaw summarized much of our research in an 
informative whitepaper, to assist those wishing to better 
understand how AI applies to cybersecurity. The paper 
provides high\-level summaries of how AI can be used 
by both cyber professionals and adversaries, the risks 
AI systems are exposed to, safety, privacy and ethics 
concerns and how the regulatory landscape is evolving to 
meet these challenges.

Practical Attacks on Machine Learning Systems: NCC 
Group’s Chief Scientist authored this formative paper 
which collects a set of notes and research projects 
conducted by NCC Group on the topic of the security of 
ML systems. The paper provides industry perspective 
to the academic community, while collating helpful 
references for security practitioners, to enable more 
effective security auditing and security\-focused code 
review of ML systems. Details of specific practical attacks 
and common security problems are described throughout 
the paper. 

Security Implications in Machine Learning: Chris Anley’s 
blog, “Five Essential Machine Learning Security Papers,” 
underscores the security challenges in ML systems as 
seen through landmark exploitation techniques described 
across five key academic papers.

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research Report

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research ReportCode Review with AI and ML: We wrote articles 
discussing the intersection of code review and ML. From 
using Semgrep with Jupyter Notebook files by Jose 
Selvi to Chris Anley’s caution against using ChatGPT for 
security code reviews, there is a clear acknowledgment 
of ML’s growing influence in this domain. However, there 
is also a recognition of its limitations, emphasizing human 
expertise’s continued relevance.

Don’t use ChatGPT for security code review. It’s not 
meant to be used that way, it doesn’t really work 
(although you might be fooled into thinking it does), 
and there are some other major problems that make 
it impractical. Also, both the CEO of OpenAI and 
ChatGPT itself say that you shouldn’t. \- Chris Anley, 
NCC Group Chief Scientist

Intelligent Web Crawling with ML: Project Bishop, performed 
by Thomas Atkinson and Jose Selvi, was a continuation of 
Project Ava and explored the use of ML for intelligent web 
crawling. It emphasized the power and potential of ML in 
enhancing web application security testing tasks.

Generative AI is stealing the spotlight at the moment 
but smaller, specialized AI/ML models that can be run 
locally are also becoming usefully powerful to run on 
accessible consumer grade hardware. In the coming 
years we should expect both attacker and defender 
tooling to increasingly make use of these smaller, 
localized models. \- Thomas Atkinson, Managing 
Security Consultant

Eric Schorn provided great insight across a range of ML topics 
in a blog series that will continue into 2024 across 10 eventual 
lessons:

• Machine Learning 101: The Integrity of Image 
(Mis)Classification: This blog highlights 
various security\-related weaknesses in ML 
systems. Topics range from the brittleness of 
image classification models to attacking facial 
authentication systems with poisoned data, 
emphasizing the criticality of mitigating these 
weaknesses. 

• Machine Learning 102: Attacking Facial 

Authentication with Poisoned Data: This blog 
post demonstrates exactly how a data poisoning 
attack might work to insert a backdoor into a 
facial authentication system. 

• Machine Learning 103: Exploring LLM Code 

Generation: This executable blog post explores 
code generation from a 16 billion\-parameter large 
language model (LLM). 

• Machine Learning 104: Breaking AES with Power 
Side\-Channels: In this post, Eric discusses how 
deep ML techniques can be used in cryptography, 
revealing potential vulnerabilities in systems 
hitherto considered impregnable.

ML in Malware Analysis 

Machine Learning for Malware Analysis: Matt Lewis’ work 
with University College London (UCL) on “Machine 
Learning for Static Analysis of Malware: Expansion of 
Research Scope” showed the utility of ML in enhancing 
static analysis of malware. By leveraging ML, there is 
potentially improved efficiency in processing data and 
recognizing malicious patterns, thus offering better 
detection rates than traditional methods. However, 
adversarial attacks present a potential challenge to 
these methods, underscoring the importance of robust 
defenses.

Impersonation \& Privacy Concerns 

AI\-generated Impersonation: In the article “Impersonating 
Gamers with GPT\-2”, David Brauchler deep dived into 
the use of OpenAI’s GPT\-2 model to mimic gamers’ 
conversations. The key theme here was the potential 
security and privacy risks that come with AI\-generated 
content, especially within online communities like gaming. 
The research effectively demonstrated GPT\-2’s ability 
to create a convincing imitation of user interactions, 
emphasizing the urgent need for countermeasures 
against AI\-driven impersonation attacks.

Large Language Models (LLMs) 

Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities: “Exploring Prompt Injection 
Attacks” by Jose Selvi delved into the vulnerabilities 
in terminal sessions, where attackers can manipulate 
command prompts to inject malicious LLM behaviors. 

Treat the output of your Large Language Model (LLM) 
as untrusted data within your threat model. While AI 
providers implement safeguards against threats such 
as Prompt Injection, attackers can still manipulate 
inputs to generate unexpected outputs. These outputs 
may include payloads that exploit vulnerabilities in the 
underlying application or infrastructure. \- Jose Selvi, 
Executive Principal Security Consultant

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research Report

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research Report 
Matt Lewis explored the potential data security challenges 
around LLM prompt security, through an example of how a 
seemingly innocent set of user prompts could potentially 
lead to unwanted profiling of that user.

Large Language Models (LLMs) and Overfitting: Several 
articles, such as “Exploring LLM Code Generation” and 
“Exploring Overfitting Risks in Large Language Models” by 
Jose Selvi, address the potential and pitfalls of LLMs. Concerns 
like overfitting, data inference, and the reproduction of 
copyrighted content underline the caution required in 
leveraging these models.

“
“

AI security is a pressing concern in security research. 
As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly 
integrated into our lives, safeguarding them against 
malicious attacks and ensuring their ethical use is 
paramount. Ongoing research is crucial to stay ahead 
of emerging threats and develop robust defense 
mechanisms.” \- ChatGPT (prompted about its own 
security)

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research Report

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research ReportIncident Response \& Threat Intelligence Research 

Several high\-caliber research outputs from our threat 
intelligence and incident response teams the past two 
years provide a multi\-faceted view of the current threat 
landscape, from nation\-state advanced persistent threats 
(APTs) to new malware variants and evolving ransomware 
tactics. 

Across this research, several recurring themes and trends 
emerged:

• Lateral Movement via Remote Desktop Protocol 
(RDP): Multiple threat actors, including those 
deploying ShadowPad, LockBit 3\.0, Everest, and 
Black Basta, utilized RDP for lateral movement 
within a compromised environment 

• Use of Legitimate Tools for Malicious Purposes: 
Tools like ADFind, PowerView, and Cobalt 
Strike are leveraged by various threat actors for 
information gathering, command and control, and 
lateral movement 

• Persistent Threats in App Stores: Despite 

ongoing efforts to secure platforms like the 
Google Play Store, malicious actors continue to 
infiltrate it, as seen with SharkBot 

• Diverse Initial Access Methods: From exploiting 

vulnerabilities to leveraging social engineering 
on platforms like LinkedIn, threat actors employ a 
range of methods to gain initial access to target 
environments

“

“

Cyber threat is a constantly evolving 
space, presenting unique challenges for 
organizations aiming to safeguard their 
digital assets. One of the most effective ways 
to stay ahead of these threats is through 
vigilant incident response and in\-depth threat 
intelligence research. These two facets 
of cybersecurity not only facilitate timely 
responses to attacks but also offer insights 
into the tactics, techniques, and procedures 
(TTPs) of adversaries.\- Matt Hull, Global 
Head of Threat Intelligence

In summary, these research outputs underscore the need 
for organizations to continuously adapt and evolve their 
cyber defenses, given the dynamic nature of threats and 
the sophisticated tactics employed by adversaries. 

Real\-World Compromise \& TTPs 

2000 Citrix NetScalers backdoored in mass\-exploitation 
campaign: Fox\-IT uncovered a large\-scale exploitation 
campaign of Citrix NetScalers in a joint effort with the 
Dutch Institute of Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD). An 
adversary had been identified exploiting in automated 
fashion, placing webshells on vulnerable NetScalers to 
gain persistent access. The adversary could execute 
arbitrary commands with the webshell, even when a 
NetScaler was patched and/or rebooted. The Dutch 
Institute of Vulnerability Disclosure notified the victims 
as identified by Fox\-IT. At the time of the exploitation 
campaign, Fox\-IT enumerated 31,127 NetScalers 
worldwide that were vulnerable to CVE\-2023\-3519\.

“

“

“In light of several serious FortiGate, Citrix 
and Cisco vulnerabilities, edge device 
exploitation is picking up its pace. As your 
network’s first line of defence, visibility on 
these devices is often scarce and overlooked, 
making responding to these threats difficult. 
We believe investing in visibility, such as 
central logging, patch management and 
Incident Response readiness will make the 
difference when it comes to responding to 
these types of threats. “– Security Research 
Team, Fox\-IT (part of NCC Group)

ShadowPad Intrusion: William Backhouse, Michael 
Mullen, and Nikolaos Pantazopoulos provided insights 
into the TTPs of a Chinese APT leveraging the 
ShadowPad malware. Initial access was achieved 
through a vulnerability, with successive backdoors being 
installed. Tools like ADFind and PowerView were used 
for information gathering, and ShadowPad was used 
extensively for lateral movement, command and control, 
and data exfiltration.

BUMBLEBEE Malicious Loader: This research highlighted 
BUMBLEBEE, a new loader that incorporates anti\-analysis 
techniques and utilizes Rabbort.DLL for process injection. It 
can download and execute malicious payloads such as Cobalt 
Strike beacons. 

Post\-Conti Data Leaks: Despite the public disclosure of Conti’s 
tools and conversations, Conti operators continued their 
activities. Techniques observed include the use of Cobalt 
Strike and different legitimate remote access software for 
persistence.

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research Report

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research ReportHardware \& Embedded Systems

“

“

Our hardware and embedded systems security experts 
engaged in a wide range of research across 2022 
and 2023, delving deep into the intricacies of device 
vulnerabilities, secure development practices, and real\-
world implications of compromised hardware.

Key themes and observations from this research domain 
were:

• Early\-stage Security: We highlighted the 

w

significance of integrating security measures right 
from the initial stages of hardware and system 
development 

• Vulnerability Analysis: Comprehensive 

investigation of vulnerabilities in various hardware 
appliances including printers, routers, and 
storage devices revealed systemic vulnerabilities 

• Secure Boot: Our deep dives into ROM 

vulnerabilities and secure boot bypasses 
emphasized the importance of robust initial 
stages of device operation 

• Microcontroller Security: As microcontrollers 
become ubiquitous in IoT and embedded 
systems, their security remains paramount

Product security cannot be easily added after the 
product is complete. Engaging your security team 
early and often is the only cost\-effective way to ensure 
that you are protecting your customers. The system 
threat model and security requirements need to be 
understood by the development team before they 
begin their foundational component selection and 
implementation decisions. Relying on your chipset and 
Board Support Package (BSP) vendors to provide a 
complete security story is rarely viable. \- Rob Wood, 
Global VP for Hardware \& Embedded Security

The overarching message from our research outputs was 
the imperative, continued need for proactive measures, 
deep analysis, and consistent vigilance in the domain of 
hardware and embedded security. 

Firmware Extraction and Analysis 

Catalin Visinescu detailed a methodology to bypass 
software update package encryption and directly 
extract the firmware of the Lexmark MC3224i printer. By 
desoldering the flash from the PCB, it was possible to 
analyse and retrieve the printer firmware, demonstrating 
the potential vulnerabilities that exist even when 
manufacturers take measures to secure their software 
updates.

Hardware in the Secure Development Lifecycle 

Rob Wood highlighted the importance of prioritizing 
security during the early stages of hardware and embedded 
systems development. By embedding security from 
inception, developers can evade the pitfalls of potential 
vulnerabilities. Proactive measures can result in long\-term 
savings, bolstered product reliability, and an enhanced 
brand reputation. Rob presented the need for thorough 
threat analysis, security requirements integration, and 
consistent security testing.

Microcontroller Security 

In his exploration of the ESP32 microcontroller, Jameson 
Hyde shed light on potential security challenges and 
provided a comprehensive guide to implementing secure 
design principles. These recommendations encompassed 
secure boot and flash encryption protocols, key 
management, and secure coding guidelines.

ROM Vulnerabilities and Secure Boot 

Jon Szymaniak unravelled a ROM\-level defect in NXP i.MX 
application processors that had the potential to exploit 
the secure boot process. This research underscored 
additional vulnerabilities that can manifest when ROM\-
resident authentication code is utilized for a second\-stage 
loader. 

Additionally, Ilya Zhuravlev applied some creative fault 
injection attacks to bypassed secure boot on a UNISOC 
system\-on\-chip which is used in millions of Android 
phones worldwide. 

Finally, Sultan Qasim Khan released a technical advisory 
for the ever\-popular U\-Boot bootloader, describing how 
a physical attacker can compromise a device during the 
USB\-based firmware update process.

BIOS Analysis 

Jeremy Boone embarked on an in\-depth analysis of Intel’s 
Alder Lake BIOS, exposing a time\-of\-check\-time\-of\-use 
(TOCTOU) vulnerability in a SMI handler, which posed 
a high risk of privilege escalation. Another Intel BIOS 
vulnerability was discovered which was unique due to it 
being remotely exploitable over Bluetooth. Finally, Jeremy 
delved into the vulnerabilities present in Insyde Software’s 
System Management Mode (SMM) modules, discovering 
vulnerabilities that impact hundreds of laptop models 
across multiple vendors.

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research Report 
Memory Security Concerns 

Rob Wood discussed the paramount importance of 
addressing security concerns with regards to modern 
memory technologies, when designing embedded 
systems. Neglecting these concerns can lead to 
significant data compromises.

Platform Root of Trust 

Jeremy Boone embarked on an audit of AMI’s Tektagon 
Open Edition, an open\-source Platform Root of Trust 
(PRoT) solution. This research emphasized the role of 
hardware root\-of\-trust (HRoT) in maintaining firmware 
integrity.

Bluetooth 

Sultan Qasim Khan developed a new type of Bluetooth 
Low Energy (BLE) relay attack operating at the link layer, 
enabling low latency relaying of BLE connections with 
and without link layer encryption release in a trifecta of 
technical advisories. The capabilities of this relay made 
it possible to defeat proximity authentication on several 
targets resistant to prior relay attack tooling. This relay 
attack was publicly demonstrated against several targets, 
including the Tesla Model 3 and Y, and Kwikset/Wiser Kevo 
smart locks, for which technical advisories describing their 
susceptibility and possible mitigations approaches were 
published. NCC Group disclosed details to companies 
behind the affected products researched before publicly 
releasing technical details – we have been discussing 
mitigation approaches with the Bluetooth Special Interest 
Group (SIG).

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research Report

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research ReportOperating System Security

Quite a few of our research projects across 2022 and 
2023 related to Operating System security. Key themes 
and insights from these research projects were: 

• Enhancing Security Through Modern Languages: 
The adoption of Rust as a safer alternative to 
traditional languages continues, specifically 
regarding kernel and driver development 

• Forensic Capabilities: We developed tools and 

methodologies to aid forensic investigations, 
particularly related to Microsoft Windows 
telemetry 

• Detection Mechanisms: We performed research 
aimed at detecting subversive techniques 
used by malicious software, such as implant 
frameworks 

• Memory and Boot Chain Integrity: Ensuring the 

security of memory processes, from handling 
exceptions to boot chains in operating systems 
and devices can sometimes still be challenging 
for modern operating systems 

• Bypassing Existing Security Measures: We 
performed detailed insights into how some 
security mechanisms, like DEP, can potentially 
be bypassed, aiming to identify and rectify such 
vulnerabilities

“
“

Our team’s rigorous exploration into Windows and 
Linux telemetry and memory integrity, and the 
transformative potential of languages like Rust, 
reflects our unwavering commitment to advancing 
the field of future OS security, which is not just about 
defending but about proactively understanding, 
anticipating, and innovating. \- Matt Lewis, Global 
Head of Research

Anomalous Vectored Exception Handlers Detection on 
Windows: we researched post\-exploitation frameworks 
using Vectored Exception Handling (VEH) on Microsoft 
Windows to subvert hook detection. One such discovery 
led to Ollie Whitehouse’s creation of a “Copy on Write 
Detector” capable of identifying patches in the traditional 
memory patching process. This allows us to enumerate 
and identify potentially malicious VEH handlers. The 
shared code can verify if a process uses VEH, which 
handlers are present, which modules they point to, and 
whether they point to known modules.

Windows Telemetry and Customer Interaction Tracker 
(CIT): Up until Windows version 7, a telemetry source 
named Customer Interaction Tracker was present. 
The CIT database, when parsed, can aid in forensic 
investigations. Erik Schamper provided code to parse 
the CIT database and integrated these findings into an 
investigation framework to handle various evidence data. 

Detection Opportunities for Windows Implant Framework: 
Ollie Whitehouse’s research shared insights through a 
lightning talk on opportunities to detect implant framework 
behaviours on Windows.

18

FreeBSD Kernel Module in Rust: Modern languages like 
Rust provide enhanced security by eliminating common 
memory safety security bugs. David Young’s research 
looked at community efforts towards this and presented 
a basic proof\-of\-concept kernel module for FreeBSD 
developed in Rust.

Rustproofing Linux: With Rust’s introduction to the Linux 
Kernel, there’s anticipation that developers will port 
or create new device drivers in Rust. Domen Puncer 
Kugler’s four\-part research series investigated the 
security dynamics of porting a Linux device driver from 
C to Rust. Through this, five vulnerable drivers in C were 
transitioned to Rust to explore potential vulnerability 
persistency after the porting.

Bypassing Windows DEP with a Custom ROP Chain: Alex 
Zaviyalov delved into the crafting of a custom ROP chain 
to circumvent Windows 10’s Data Execution Prevention 
(DEP). 

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research Report 
Exploit Development Group

NCC Group’s Exploit Development Group (EDG) is a 
small team of full\-time exploit developers who write 
custom exploits exclusively for the purpose of helping our 
clients test their own infrastructure and systems using 
real\-world attacks against contemporary vulnerabilities to 
better understand their risk and resilience.

• Router, Printers and NAS Vulnerabilities: A 

major focus was on exploring vulnerabilities in 
consumer routers (such as TP\-Link, Netgear, 
Synology), small business routers (Ubiquiti) and 
in enterprise printers (Lexmark and Canon) and 
network attached storage (Western Digital) 

EDG often present their research externally and 
occasionally will speak publicly about advanced 
vulnerability research and exploitation. In recent years, 
they have been enjoying great success in the prestigious 
Zero Day Initiative Pwn2Own competitions, finishing third 
place in the 2022 Pwn2Own Toronto competition.

Key EDG research outputs in 2022 and 2023 included:

• Exploit Development and Methodology: Multiple 
EDG presentations were given at global tier\-
1 conferences and concentrated on exploit 
development techniques, methodologies, and the 
tools employed 

• Linux Kernel Security: The team identified several 

Linux kernel security vulnerabilities and outlined 
ways to exploit them 

• Training \& Secondments: Internal NCC Group 
secondments were provided to NCC Group 
employees to develop their exploitation skills, 
while free, advanced exploitation training was 
incorporated into the Open Security Training 2 
Platform

“

EDG is conscious of advanced attackers targeting 
networking devices in the wild over recent years. 
This together with more industry awareness of the 
exploitation of 0\-day security issues has changed the 
security landscape and methods needed for defence. 
EDG’s research into these areas and fundamental 
core technologies (i.e., the Linux kernel) which 
underpin critical infrastructure allows NCC Group to 
stay up to date with advanced exploitation techniques 
and provide pragmatic guidance to NCC Group’s 
customers. \- Alex Plaskett (Security Researcher) 

Over the last few years, many employees have ended 
up working within remote environments. With this comes 
additional security challenges \- what was once the 
enterprise network perimeter is expanded to consumer 
devices with questionable security. EDG’s research has 
highlighted significant weaknesses in a number of these 
consumer devices and demonstrates how a sufficiently 
advanced attacker is able to remotely compromise, 
laterally move to internal networks and maintain 
persistence using vulnerabilities unknown to the vendor. 
Overall, EDG research outputs represented cutting\-
edge explorations in the world of advanced vulnerability 
exploitation and development:

At NCC Group’s internal conference “NCC Con Europe 
2022” in Spain, Cedric Halbronn, Aaron Adams, 
Alex Plaskett and Catalin Visinescu delivered two 
presentations, allowing the wider NCC Group research 
community to grasp the methodology and approach 
adopted for vulnerability research, especially with 
regards to the Pwn2Own competition. The talk covered 
approaches from both hardware and software security 
and demonstrated why it is important to consider both 
aspects in embedded systems security. 

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research ReportAlex Plaskett and Cedric Halbronn unveiled research 
dubbed “Toner Deaf – Printing your next persistence” at 
Hexacon 2022\. Their talk revolved around the remote 
network\-based exploitation of a Lexmark printer, 
demonstrating how an attacker could maintain access 
to a compromised printer across firmware updates and 
restarts. The team also published a detailed blog in this 
area. 

McCaulay Hudson found and disclosed multiple 
vulnerabilities in consumer routers. The first, 
“MeshyJSON: A TP\-Link tdpServer JSON Stack 
Overflow”, and the second, “Puckungfu: A NETGEAR 
WAN Command Injection”. Both vulnerabilities were 
discovered during the preparation phase for the 
Pwn2Own competition. 

McCaulay delved further into the NETGEAR vulnerability 
in his article on the NETGEAR RAX30 router: “NETGEAR 
Routers: A Playground for Hackers?” Which provided a 
detailed look at the security vulnerabilities inherent in 
NETGEAR’s custom binaries. While McCaulay pointed 
out various security lapses, he also acknowledged the 
security measures implemented by NETGEAR, making 
several vulnerabilities challenging to exploit. EDG also 
published another detailed blog post on another Netgear 
remote vulnerability which Netgear released patches to 
address. 

Another critical presentation, “HITBAMS – Your Not 
so ‘Home’ Office – Soho Hacking at Pwn2Own”, by 
Alex Plaskett and McCaulay Hudson spotlighted the 
endeavours of EDG in Pwn2Own targeting consumer 
routers and using this to pivot to compromise devices on 
the internal network. This involved exploiting both LAN 
and WAN perspectives and then using this compromise to 
move laterally and attack other devices on the network.

The Linux kernel was the focal point for EDG at 
OffensiveCon 2023\. Cedric Halbronn and Alex Plaskett 
illuminated the audience on “Exploit Engineering – 
Attacking the Linux Kernel”. Over the last year EDG found 

and exploited 3 privilege escalation vulnerabilities against 
a fully patched OS with all mitigations enabled. The most 
recent vulnerability was patched against versions of the 
kernel going back 6 years, demonstrating that exploitable 
issues can exist in highly critical operating system 
software for long periods of time. The team also published 
an in\-depth blog in this area.

EDG also published an in\-depth article on exploiting 
Western Digital NAS (which they had performed the 
previous year at Pwn2Own) using a memory corruption 
issue in an open\-source library (Netatalk) which was used 
on the NAS. This issue together with other vulnerabilities 
lead to the vendor removing the Netatalk service to 
reduce attack surface on the device. 

Alex Plaskett later presented at @SysPWN on “SysPWN 
– VR for Pwn2Own”, giving insights into the Pwn2Own 
competition from various perspectives. The talk was 
segmented into two sections, the first section discussing 
high level experience and learning in Pwn2Own and the 
latter part delving into the vulnerabilities that NCC Group 
EDG leveraged during the 2021 and 2022 Pwn2Own 
events.

On the training side Cedric Halbronn successfully 
launched his class on Windows Kernel Exploitation on 
the Open Security Training 2 Platform. The class teaches 
how to exploit a race condition vulnerability leading to a 
use\-after\-free in the Kernel Transaction Manager (KTM) 
component of the Windows kernel. It shows the approach 
an exploit developer should take in attacking a previously 
unresearched component in the Windows kernel.

Aaron Adams presented at HITB Phuket 2023, detailing 
the exploitation of two PostScript vulnerabilities in 
Lexmark printers as successfully used during Pwn2Own 
2022 Toronto. The talk delved into the internals of an 
interpreters (PostScript) functionality and highlighted how 
an advanced attacker could use this to gain access to 
Lexmark devices.

Collaboration with Industry \& Academia

In the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats, 
fostering a collaborative approach to cybersecurity 
research has become more crucial than ever. By 
leveraging the collective expertise and diverse 
perspectives of industry peers and academic institutions, 
NCC Group has significantly enriched its knowledge 
base, stimulated innovative solutions, and accelerated 
the development of advanced cybersecurity tools and 
methodologies. These research collaborations not only 
bolster our ability to safeguard against emerging threats 
but also serve as a testament to the power of unity in 
addressing the complex challenges posed by the digital 
age. 

Some examples of this collaboration from the past couple 
of years include: 

Quantum Datacenter of the Future

NCC Group is a key participant in the UK Research \& 
Innovation (UKRI) 3\-year funded Quantum Data Centre of 
the Future project, a comprehensive consortium led by 
ORCA Computing and consisting of 14 organizations and 
universities. This initiative aims to seamlessly incorporate 
quantum communication and computing systems into 
classical data centers, revolutionizing the future of 
data storage and processing. KETS Quantum Security 
continues to develop quantum key distribution and 
random number generation capabilities for the datacenter, 
a project on which NCC Group has been providing crucial 
security architecture and design support. 

Working with UCL on AI/ML Cyber Research

Since 2017, NCC Group has been working with University 
College London’s (UCL) Centre for Data Intensive Science and 
Industry (DISI), situated within their Department of Physics 

and Astronomy. DISI serves as a vital conduit for nurturing 
and engaging MSc and PhD students in AI research, 
training, and the facilitation of knowledge transfer 
between the academic and industrial sectors. In 2022, 
we provided a six\-month full\-time placement for a final year 
PhD student within DISI, providing them with a range of 
cutting\-edge research challenges in the realm of AI and 
Machine Learning. During this placement, PhD student 
Nikolay Walters developed a tool using Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) techniques and the pre\-trained 
CodeBERT model to identify exposed secrets and crypto 
miners in source code. Additionally, Nikolay created an 
email ecosystem powered by OpenAI’s GPT\-3, capable of 
generating and replying to emails automatically. 

IoT \& Equity, Inclusion \& Sustainability with 
Edinburgh University

Leveraging insights from Human\-Computer Interaction, 
Design, and Law, in 2022 we committed research support 
to an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research 
Council (EPSRC) consortium research grant to discern future 
challenges and conceive equitable IoT solutions. Led by 
the University of Edinburgh, other collaborators include 
UK consumer champion Which?, BBC Research \& 
Development, and the Department of Employment and 
Social Development in the Canadian Government. 

This interdisciplinary project, spanning two years, is 
delving into the growing concerns surrounding the lack 
of repairability in the consumer Internet of Things (IoT) 
and its potential repercussions on equity, inclusion, 
and sustainability in the digital landscape. As IoT 
devices become increasingly prevalent, there is an 
emergent risk of a digital divide, especially for lower\-
income households, stemming from the non\-durability 
of these devices, poor cybersecurity, data misuse, and 

environmental unsustainability. Output from the research 
will derive a toolkit that offers comprehensive guidelines 
for manufacturers, policymakers, and the general 
community to champion more sustainable and equitable 
IoT practices.

UK Department for Science, Innovation \& Technology 
(DSIT) and Enterprise IoT Security

In response to the rising prevalence of ‘smart’ devices 
in office environments, in October 2022, the UK’s 
Department for Science, Innovation \& Technology (DSIT) 
initiated a research project with NCC Group to assess the 
cybersecurity risks posed by popular enterprise connected 
devices utilized by UK businesses. These devices, if 
compromised, could potentially grant attackers access 
to sensitive business data. The investigation involved 
testing these devices against current security principles 
and guidelines to gauge their resilience against evolving 
cyber threats. Findings from our research revealed 
various alarming vulnerabilities, including prevalent 
outdated software, with one instance being over 15 years 
old. A total of 1 critical and 9 high\-risk vulnerabilities 
were identified across 8 tested devices, some of which 
could allow full access to a device’s camera or the ability 
to monitor and record VoIP calls. Moreover, our study 
found that a higher price does not necessarily equate to 
better security, highlighting the need for further policy and 
legislative considerations in this domain.

Appendix 1: Open\-Source Security Tool \& Code Releases 

Between 2022 and 2023 we released over 21 open\-source security tools, major tool updates, implementations, or other 
open\-source repositories. Our tools provide insight or efficiency gains across several distinct areas of cybersecurity. 
Among the open\-source tools released by NCC Group during this period were: 

Cloud \& Container Security

• Insject: A tool for poking at containers. It enables users 
to run an arbitrary command in a container or any mix of 
Linux namespaces

• Aerides: An implementation of infrastructure\-as\-
code (IaC) scanning using dynamic tooling. This tool 
demonstrates how to integrate LocalStack and dynamic 
tools for assessing IaC. It includes mock infrastructure for 
a web service written using Terraform’s HCL

• Monkey 365: A security tool to conduct Microsoft 365 
and Azure subscriptions and Azure Active Directory 
security configuration reviews without the significant 
overhead of learning tool APIs or complex admin panels 
from the outset

• Project Kubescout: Adding Kubernetes Support to Scout 
Suite \- ScoutSuite scanning capability for Kubernetes 
clusters

• ScoutSuite 5\.12\.0: Scout Suite can now also scan 
Kubernetes clusters. Scout Suite is an open source 
multi\-cloud security\-auditing tool, which enables security 
posture assessment of cloud environments. Using the 
APIs exposed by cloud providers, ScoutSuite gathers 
configuration data for manual inspection and highlights 
risk areas 

• ScoutSuite 5\.13\.0: This version includes multiple new 
rules and findings for Azure, which align with some of 
the latest CIS Benchmark checks, multiple bug fixes 
and feature enhancements, and minor finding template 
corrections. Supported Python versions have also been 
updated to cover versions 3\.9 and newer

• CowCloud: A serverless solution to distribute workloads 
in AWS. CowCloud was created to run recon tools and 
vulnerability scans in a distributed way; for example, one 
use case might be by bug bounty hunters. This solution 
abstracts end users from the underlying work required to 
distribute workloads in AWS. CowCloud provides users 
with a friendly web interface to view and create new tasks 
consumed by Python code running on worker nodes (EC2 
instances)

• Kubetcd: It automates pod deployment by writing 
directly into etcd. It includes multiple functions for post\-
exploitation of compromised etcds.

open\-source mathematics software system

26

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research Report 
• DroppedConnection: Emulates a Cisco ASA AnyConnect 
VPN service, accepting any credentials (and logging 
them) before serving VBS to the client that is executed in 
the context of the user

• Magisk module \- Conscrypt Trust User Certs: This module 
makes all installed user certificates part of the APEX 
module com.android.conscrypt certificate store in Android 
14, so that they will automatically be used when building 
the trust chain.

Data Extraction \& Monitoring

• Mimikatz Detector: ConDrv is a device created by 
condrv.sys, which handles the traffic between the Console 
Application (cmd/powershell/etc) and the actual console 
(conhost.exe). Console Monitor is a C\# GUI application 
that shows the end user every keystroke or line sent to or 
from the console

• Mimikatz detector driver: A USB HID driver emulation 
with PID/VID (0x3bca/0x27bb) of Plenom A/S Busylight 
Alpha supported by Mimikatz

• MetadataPlus: A tool to extract metadata from Microsoft 
Office files that includes new locations not checked in 
other tools

• Code Credential Scanner (ccs): This script is intended 
to scan a large, diverse codebase for hard\-coded 
credentials, or credentials present in configuration files. 
These represent a serious security issue, and can be 
extremely hard to detect and manage

• Code Query (cq): A universal code security scanning tool. 
CQ scans code for security vulnerabilities and other items 
of interest to security\-focused code reviewers. It outputs 
text files containing references to issues found, into an 
output directory. These output files can then be reviewed, 
filtered by unix command line tools such as grep, or used 
as a means to ‘jump’ into the codebase at the specified 
file:line reference

• Cartographer: A code coverage mapping plugin for 
Ghidra, enabling researchers to observe which parts of 
a program have been executed without requiring source 
code

• LibSLUB: A python library to examine the SLUB 
management structures and object allocations (the Linux 
kernel heap implementation) python library to examine the 
SLUB management structures and object allocations (the 
Linux kernel heap implementation)

• Exploit Mitigations: EDG continued to maintain a list of 
exploitation mitigations over time in various operating 
systems, software, libraries and hardware

Web \& Network Interactions

• JWT ReAuth Version 1\.0\.0: Provides Burp with a way to 
authenticate with a given endpoint, parse out the provided 
token and then attach it as a header on requests going to 
a given scope

• Web3 Decoder: A Burp Suite Extension that helps to 
analyze what is going on with the operations involving 
smart contracts of the web3\. This is mainly JSON\-RPC 
calls to Ethereum Nodes, and nodes of other compatible 
networks (like Polygon, Arbitrum, BSC...)

2022 \& 2023 NCC Group Research Report 
 
 
Appendix 3: Technical Advisories 

In an era where our dependence on technology has never been more pronounced, the vigilance in detecting 
vulnerabilities within the digital systems and tools we use daily has become paramount. This section sheds light on 
over 69 security vulnerabilities uncovered in various products, a testament to the rigorous research endeavors our team 
undertook throughout 2022 and 2023\. Vulnerability research is not merely an academic exercise; it plays a pivotal role 
in ensuring the digital safety of individuals, businesses, and nations. Each vulnerability identified presents an opportunity 
for malicious entities to exploit and compromise systems, leading to data breaches, financial losses, and even threats to 
human safety. 

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) process stands as a keystone in the security landscape. By assigning 
a unique identifier to each vulnerability, the CVE system provides a standardized way of sharing and communicating the 
nature and severity of threats. Equally crucial is the act of responsible vulnerability disclosure. This ensures that vendors 
are made aware of potential flaws in their systems and are given an opportunity to address them, thus strengthening 
the overall security posture of their products. The patches and fixes that arise from this collaborative process between 
researchers and vendors are emblematic of the collective effort required to fortify our digital world against evolving 
threats. 

Key themes that emerged across the vulnerabilities found include:

• Remote Exploits: Many of the vulnerabilities related 
to Remote Code Execution and Authenticated Remote 
Command Execution, which focus on the ability of an 
attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on a target 
system

• Memory Issues: Several of the vulnerabilities related 
to how software manages memory, highlighting gaps 
in secure development lifecycles and/or programmer 
security training. These vulnerabilities can lead to data 
leaks, crashes, or even the execution of arbitrary code

• Input Validation: A recurring theme was improper 
handling of input. Failing to validate or sanitize inputs 
can allow attackers to inject malicious code, access 
unauthorized data, or disrupt system operations

• Multiple Vulnerabilities: Several products were affected 
by “Multiple Vulnerabilities,” meaning that they were 
exploitable via several different classes of vulnerability. 
That modern products can be so vulnerable and exposed, 
often out\-of\-the\-box is alarming and attests to disregard 
for principles of security by the product manufacturers
