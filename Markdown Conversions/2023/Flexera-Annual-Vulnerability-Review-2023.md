## Introduction
This Flexera 2023 Software Vulnerability & Threat Intelligence Report is based upon data from the 
Flexera Secunia Research Team who produces valuable advisories leveraged by users of Flexera’s 
Software Vulnerability Research and Software Vulnerability Manager solutions.  
The report analyzes the evolution of software security from a vulnerability, threat intelligence and 
patch perspective.  
The report presents global data on the prevalence of vulnerabilities, exploits, the availability of 
patches and maps the security threats to IT infrastructures.  
What does the report cover?  
The annual Vulnerability Review is based on data from Flexera's Secunia Research. Secunia Research 
monitors more than 69,000 applications, appliances and operating systems, and tests and verifies the 
vulnerabilities reported in them.  
The systems and applications monitored by Secunia Research are in use in the environments of the 
customers of Flexera Software Vulnerability Management solutions.  
The vulnerability database covers vulnerabilities that can be exploited in all types of products, 
including software, hardware and firmware.  
The vulnerabilities verified by Secunia Research are described in Secunia Advisories and listed in the 
Flexera Vulnerability Database, detailing what IT security teams need to know to mitigate the 
vulnerability risk posed in their environments. The Secunia Advisory descriptions include criticality, 
attack vector, exploitability and solution status.  
How do we count vulnerabilities?  
Research houses in the vulnerability management space adopt different approaches to counting 
vulnerabilities.  
Secunia Research counts vulnerabilities per product in which the vulnerability appears. We apply this 
method to reflect the level of information our customers need to keep their environments secure.  
We provide verified intelligence listing all products affected by a given vulnerability.   
  
  
  
Secunia Research Software Vulnerability tracking process  
A vulnerability is an error in software which can be exploited with a security impact and gain. Secunia 
Research validates, verifies and tests vulnerability information to author security advisories which 
provide valuable details by following consistent and standard processes that have been refined over 
the years.  
Ó2024 Flexera   |   Company Conﬁden4al

Whenever a new vulnerability is reported, it’s verified and a Secunia Advisory is published. A Secunia 
Advisory provides details, including description of the vulnerability, risk rating, impact, attack vector, 
recommended mitigation, credits, references and more, including additional details discovered 
during verification and testing, thus providing the information required to make appropriate 
decisions about how to protect systems.

## Example why it’s not a good idea to rely on NVD only
Vulnerability:  CVE-2023-46589  
(Information per 1/9/2024)  
NIST / NVD Data:  
NIST (CVE.ORG) record created: 10/23/2023  
NVD Published date:                     11/28/2023  
Affected products (NVD):            Apache Tomcat 8.5—11.0.0  
Last Modified:                                01/05/2024 (Modified)

Conclusion(s):  
1. NVD largely relies on the vendors or third parties updating the CVE entries on MITRE (like more vendor 
advisory links), so, e.g., in this example there was no information added to the MITRE Tomcat CVE 
entry and thus NVD doesn't have anything to show beyond the basics. NVD is frequently not complete 
when it comes to libraries / components that are used in a lot of "downstreams". (downstreams: Vendors 
using libraries / components for other software products.  Best recent example is the cascading “downstream” 
effect of the Log4J and Log4shell vulnerabilities)  
  
2. Secunia Research on the other hand, don't have to rely on the MITRE information, so Secunia Research 
frequently reacts earlier, many times even before a CVE was assigned (if one gets assigned at all). 
Secunia Research Team started the CVE research on October 31. 2023, even when there was no 
publication in NVD. (only registration in NIST CVE.ORG)  
  
3. When The Apache Software Foundation officially published the Security Advisory on November 28. 
2023, Flexera did the same with SA121703 including all relevant information for remediation as well as 
additional information for optimizing the prioritization process. (Threat Intelligence, Consequence 
(Impact), and Secunia Criticality Score)  
  
4. NVD only mentions the base software product (Apache Tomcat), however since the initial publication 2 
other products released a notification regarding the vulnerability affecting their product:  
- IBM Security QRadar Siem, on Dec. 18, 2023  
- IBM Integration Bus Apache Tomcat, on Jan. 3, 2024

## 2023 summary
Total advisories: 9,402 ↑ (2022: 7,097)  
2023 broke the record for highest number of advisories issued by the Secunia Research team.  
This was for sure a busy year for cybersecurity, not only a record-breaking number of advisories and 
Vulnerabilities were reported, but also many significant vulnerabilities were the cause of data 
breaches, ransomware attacks and other types of threats that impacted many organizations 
worldwide.  
Interesting facts and trends:  
- 2023 is the year with the most recorded Secunia Advisories since 2002  
- NVD published 28,834 CVEs in 2023, an increase of 15% compared to 2022 (25,050 CVEs)  
- Average threat score went up: ↑ 15.68 (2022: 13.66) (click here to learn how we calculate this)  
- Average CVSS3 score just slightly lower: ↓ 7.28 (2022: 7.35)  
- More extreme critical advisories have been reported in 2023: 74 (2022: 44)  
- 130 advisories reported a zero-day vulnerability (2022: 85)   
- More than 50 percent of all advisories are Unix/Linux operating systems vulnerabilities.   
- More than 50 percent of all rejected advisories are also Unix/Linux operating systems related.
- Little over 72 percent of all networking-related advisories are for Cisco, F5 and Juniper  
- About Microsoft:  
    - 2.56% of all advisories were for Microsoft, which put them (again) in eighth place in vendor 
ranking.  
    - 57.6% ↑ (2022: 56 percent) of all zero-days were related to Microsoft products (first place).  
    - None of the top four vendors with the most advisories (SUSE, Red Hat, Ubuntu, Ubuntu) had any 
zero-day reported in 2023  
  
Software Vulnerability and Patch Management are becoming increasingly important. Due to the 
ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, attacks on critical infrastructures in many countries are increasing. 
Back in 2019 (just before COVID-19), patching was recommended within 30 days (or 14 days for CVSS 
score of seven or higher). Right now, hackers can deploy exploits within one week and even within 
24 hours. This means organizations need even better prioritization to quickly patch vulnerabilities 
(especially those with associated threats).

* 1,500 advisories have received the “rejected” status which means in general that the vulnerability requires one or more 
violations of security best practices (e.g., product not securely configured or not used securely) or that it was “too weak of 
a gain” (e.g., administrative, local users already being too privileged so that additional gain becomes neglectable).

### Advisory criticality and attack vector
  
![Figure 3: Overview Criticality and Attack Vector]
More information about the variables used in the above charts:  
- Attack vector (from where)  
- Criticality (severity)  
Though not in the chart, Secunia Research also provides information about the impact or 
consequence when a vulnerability has been exploited. There are twelve values that can  be 
used (most advisories have one or more). Read more here.   
  
  
Ó2024 Flexera   |   Company Conﬁden4al  
12  
  
### Advisories and Impact (Consequence of exploited)
  
Prioritizing vulnerabilities based on the 
potential consequence is a crucial aspect 
of effective cybersecurity management.  
The use of a scoring mechanism allows 
organizations to systematically assess and 
prioritize vulnerabilities, ensuring that the 
most critical issues are addressed first.  
  
below an example of a scoring table 
that can be used in a prioritization 
process.  
  
  
Impact (Consequence)  
The following are Consequence values.  
  
Brute Force  
Used in cases where an application or an algorithm allows an 
attacker to guess passwords in an easy manner.  
  
Cross-Site Scripting  
Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities allow a third party to 
manipulate the content or behavior of a web application in a 
user's browser, without compromising the underlying system. 
Different Cross-Site Scripting related vulnerabilities are also 
classified under this category, including “script insertion” and 
“cross-site request forgery”.  
Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities are often used against specific 
users of a website to steal their credentials or to conduct spoofing 
attacks.  
  
DoS (Denial of Service)  
This includes vulnerabilities ranging from excessive resource 
consumption (for example, causing a system to use a lot of 
memory) to crashing an application or an entire system.  
  
Exposure of Sensitive Information  
Vulnerabilities where documents or credentials are leaked or can 
be revealed either locally or remotely.  
  
Exposure of System Information  
Vulnerabilities where excessive information about the system (for 
example. version numbers, running services, installation paths, 
Ó2024 Flexera   |   Company Conﬁden4al  
13  
  
and similar) are exposed and can be revealed from remote 
and, in some cases, locally.  
  
Hijacking  
Covers vulnerabilities where a user session or a 
communication channel can be taken over by other users or 
remote attackers.  
  
Manipulation of Data  
This includes vulnerabilities where a user or a remote 
attacker can manipulate local data on a system, but not 
necessarily be able to gain escalated privileges or system 
access. The most frequent type of vulnerabilities with this 
impact are SQL-injection vulnerabilities, where a malicious 
user or person can manipulate SQL queries.  
  
Privilege Escalation  
Covers vulnerabilities where a user is able to conduct certain 
tasks with the privileges of other users or administrative 
users. This typically includes cases where a local user on a 
client or server system can gain access to the administrator or root 
account, thus taking full control of the system.  
  
Security Bypass  
Covers vulnerabilities or security issues where malicious users or 
people can bypass certain security mechanisms of the application. 
The actual impact varies significantly depending on the design and 
purpose of the affected application.  
  
  
Spoofing  
Covers various vulnerabilities where it is possible for malicious 
users or people to impersonate other users or systems.  
  
System Access  
Covers vulnerabilities where malicious people are able to gain 
system access and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a 
local user.  
  
Unknown  
### Rejection advisories
There are large number of vulnerabilities posted in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), by many 
vendors and CNA’s. They are not always valid, they are not always assigned proper criticality ratings, 
and in some cases, a vulnerability may be legitimate but does not provide the attacker any benefit.   
The Flexera Secunia Research team evaluates vulnerabilities from hundreds of sources, rescores them 
when necessary and even rejects vulnerabilities not worth your attention. Rejection advisories help 
you reduce the volume of vulnerabilities to be mitigated by helping you focus only on those that 
present reasonable risk to your environment.  
For compliance reasons, for example NERC (North American Electric Reliability Corporation), you may 
be required to report not only the vulnerabilities covered by the normal Advisories but also 
vulnerabilities, which our Research Team has rejected as not being a valid threat to security.  
  
On average 15% of the total number of advisories are rejection 
advisories.  2023 result was 15.95% (1,500 rejection advisories)   
  
Overview rejection advisories  
  
Ó2024 Flexera   |   Company Conﬁden4al  
14  
  
   
  
  
An advisory may be rejected for many reasons; the most common are:  
- No reachability  
The vulnerability cannot be exploited because the affected systems cannot be reached by 
an attacker.  
- No gain  
The vulnerability may be reached, but without any gain for the attacker.  
- No exploitability  
The vulnerability cannot be exploited because, for example, policy forbids installation of 
the affected software.  
- Dependent on other  
The vulnerability cannot be exploited by itself but depends on another vulnerability being 
present.

## Addressing awareness with vulnerability insights
 
- How many systems would benefit from any given security update?  
- Does it pose a risk? Is it on all systems? Patch  
  
### Prevalence
Ó2024 Flexera   |   Company Conﬁden4al  
16  
  
### Asset sensitivity
- What systems would result in the most risk if compromised?  
- Is it a high-risk device? Patch  
### Criticality
- The most popular method of thoughoul prioritization.  
- If exploited, how bad could it affect your security?  Is it designated to be of a high criticality? Patch  
### Threat intelligence
- The newest and most impactful method focuses on the likelihood of exploitation.  
- Is it likely to be exploited? Patch  
  
  
### How do we know that more insights/data is needed?
Focusing on advisories with CVSS 7 or higher would address about 50 percent of exploits. Most exploits are CVSS 
scored between four and seven. Focusing on vulnerabilities for the top 20 vendors would address only about 20 
percent.  
  
### Take away 1
High and extreme critical advisories are not necessarily those presenting the most risk. Leverage threat 
intelligence to better prioritize what demands your most urgent attention. Create a scoring mechanism 
that considers multiple variables.  
 
rejection advisories not included.

## Browser-related advisories
Web browsers serve as our gateway to the internet, providing a seamless interface for accessing 
information, services, and entertainment. However, this very connectivity exposes browsers to an array 
of vulnerabilities, in most cases exploited through a remote attack vector.  
The urgency of timely browser patching cannot be overstated. As users traverse the digital landscape, 
the constant evolution of security mechanisms by browser developers remains a critical line of 
defense. Failing to patch vulnerabilities in a timely manner increases the likelihood of falling victim to 
remote exploits, exposing users to a range of potential risks.

## Threat intelligence
In a world where there are more than 23,000 new vulnerabilities (CVE’s) every year, being smart about prioritizing 
remediation efforts is essential. Leveraging Threat Intelligence, another valuable layer of insight is provided to 
help you understand which of the vulnerabilities affecting your environment are actually being exploited in the 
wild.  
Leveraging machine learning, artificial intelligence, and human curation from thousands of sources in the open, 
deep and dark web, Threat Intelligence augments Flexera’s Software Vulnerability Research’s vulnerability 
intelligence with a Threat Score that provides the ultimate prioritization tool for your busy desktop operations 
teams.

## CVE related statistics
### Top 10 CVEs most referred to in Secunia Advisories
NVD largely relies on the vendors or third parties (CNAs) updating the CVE entries on MITRE (like more 
vendor advisory links). CVEs are reported for a component or library initially but could affect tens or 
hundreds of products “downstream”, but that kind of detailed information is not always available in a 
timely manner.  
Relying on NVD data is therefore not advised since not all products and version branches are covered. 
Other challenges with NVD are invalid or superseded vulnerabilities (with superseded fixes).  
The table below shows the top 10 of most referred CVEs in Secunia Advisories.   
.
  
Some interesting take-away from the CVE list:  
 CVE-2023-44487:  
In August and September, threat actors unleashed the biggest distributed denial-of-service attacks in 
Internet history by exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in a key technical protocol. (HTTP/2)  
  
There were 225 Secunia Advisories mentioning this CVE.  
This means that approx. 225 (downstream) products or product versions were affected by this Vulnerability.  
  
MITRE registration date:

(as of Jan .10, 2024)  
  
This is proving once again that Software Vulnerability Research is crucial for not only identifying, verifying 
and testing vulnerabilities, but also detecting all downstream software depending on these libraries and 
components (OSS) in the supply chain.  
  
## Patching
Most of 2023’s vulnerabilities were vendor patched. In fact, most vulnerabilities are patched within 24 
hours after disclosure.   
Ó2024 Flexera   |   Company Conﬁden4al  
25  
  
  
The challenge remains that organizations don’t have full visibility or awareness when a vulnerability is 
disclosed (time to awareness). Another big challenge is time to remediation (the time from having 
this information, correlating that with your environment and initiating the process to get the software 
updated to a secure version).  
  
  
### Vulnerabilities that are vendor patched
Most vulnerabilities have a patch available within 24 hours after disclosure.  
 
  
### SVM patch statistics
Flexera has the largest third-party patch catalog in the world. This helps you act quicker and save 
time by offering an integrated approach to effectively locate, prioritize and quickly remediate threats
