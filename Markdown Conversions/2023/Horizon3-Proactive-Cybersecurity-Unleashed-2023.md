Letter from the Authors

Welcome to the second annual Year in Review for 2023! We are excited to share 
how Horizon3\.ai’s customers are taking a proactive approach to cybersecurity by 
conducting autonomous pentests with the NodeZero™ platform. 

In 2022, we introduced the Through the Eyes of the Attacker perspective by 
revamping NodeZero to offer fresh and powerful features. Through this upgrade, 
NodeZero enhances how users attack their environments and enables them to take 
back their environments by proactively protecting against attacks. Additionally, 
Horizon3\.ai still enables customers to ask:

• What does my environment look like?
• Are my security tools effective?
• Did we detect the right actions?
• Are we logging the right things?
• Is my sensitive data, or are my crown jewels and keys to the kingdom safe?

Horizon3\.ai emphasizes the importance of a proactive approach in obtaining honest, 
accurate, and relevant answers to these critical questions. To achieve this, we 
advocate for adopting the perspective of an attacker and consistently attacking your 
respective environments using NodeZero, just as a nefarious cyber threat actor would 
do. This proactive stance empowers us and our customers to identify exploitable 
vulnerabilities quickly, address the most critical issues, and subsequently validate the 
effectiveness of these corrective actions though the Find, Fix, Verify loop.

In pursuit of this strategy, we are eager to share a fresh perspective with you, 
illustrating how our diverse range of customers across various industries and sectors 
utilize NodeZero. They employ this platform to proactively discover, rectify, and verify 
exploitable misconfigurations and vulnerabilities within their environments, employing 
real\-world tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly used by attackers. 
Moreover, we will provide insights into the implications of the vulnerabilities and 
weaknesses identified and offer policy recommendations aimed at enhancing our 
customers’ security posture.

Thank you to the remarkable customers and partners who collaborate with us and help 
Horizon3\.ai enhance our capabilities and products. We trust that this report will be both 
insightful and instrumental in your pursuit of a stronger security posture while staying 
ahead of attackers.

INTRODUCTION 
NodeZero Continues to Change the Game

NodeZero revolutionizes the landscape 
for organizations seeking an autonomous 
pentesting solution, creating a proactive and 
preemptive strategy that illuminates how an 
attacker sees your environment and reinforces 
resilience against cyber threats. Over the past 
year, NodeZero has redefined pentesting, 
changing the game for our customers by 
enabling them to regularly stay ahead of 
threats and harden their entire environment. 
Since our last Year in Review, we have seen a 
sharp increase in daily, monthly, and annual 
pentests. In 2023, our customers ran a total 
of nearly 30K pentests, testing 2\.05M assets, 
with 110K of those assets being related to 
critical impacts, comprised of 450K impact 
paths and 1\.5M discovered weaknesses!

Figure 1: Transform your organization and adapt to 21st 
century cyber threats by switching from slow, manual, 
once\-per\-year pentesting to continuous, autonomous 
cybersecurity with NodeZero.

Why do our customers run so many tests? 
Unlike traditional (manual) pentests, NodeZero 
allows our customers to run continuous 
pentests for no additional costs (as shown by 
Figure 1\). NodeZero also allows customers to 
see a prioritized list of vulnerabilities, proof of 
exploitation (when available), and highlights 
of notable events to enable customers to fix 
what matters first, and to verify those fixes. 
Additionally, it provides detailed attack paths that 
allow customers to walk through how an attack 
could be carried out Through the Eyes of an 
Attacker, while also showing which vulnerabilities 
led to specific downstream impacts and what 
to fix to mitigate other issues throughout the 
environment. This gives our customers a full 
graphical representation of actual attack paths 
that an attacker could use to chain together 
misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and weaknesses 
to compromise their organization.

NodeZero vs Traditional Pentesting

TRADITIONAL 
PENTESTING

Cost of Coverage
A single traditional pentest covering 300 hosts would cost $25,000 on 
average. With NodeZero you get unlimited pentests for a year at $50/host.

Speed
A single traditional pentest covering 300 hosts could take up to 8 weeks or 
more for procurement, planning, execution, and reporting. With NodeZero 
you get results within hours.

Fix Action Reports
NodeZero provides detailed fix action reports with every pentest.

Continuous Validation: Find, Fix, Verify
Your NodeZero license provides for unlimited pentesting that you can 
deploy year round to verify remediation efforts and identify new exposures 
in your environment soon after they are introduced.

Mean\-Time\-to\-Remediation (MTTR)
Given NodeZero’s coverage, speed, detailed fix actions, and continuous 
validation, your MTTR can be reduced from months to days, if not hours.

Customer Success
Your NodeZero license provides dedicated Customer Success representatives 
who work with you to optimize the value you get from NodeZero.

Observations of the Challenges Organizations Continue to Face

Here are some additional reasons why customers implement NodeZero to 
help proactively Find, Fix, and Verify vulnerabilities before they are exploited, 
while ensuring they stay compliant with industry standards and maintain 
uninterrupted business operations:

 Continuous Security Assessments: Traditional penetration tests are often 
conducted annually, leaving organizations vulnerable between tests. With 
NodeZero, security assessments can be performed more frequently, providing 
real\-time insights into vulnerabilities and potential threats.

Efficiency,Speed,andScalability:NodeZero can handle the increased scope 
and complexity of modern IT environments, ensuring thorough assessments 
without compromising on speed or accuracy. It can scan and analyze large and 
complex networks or systems much faster than manual testing. This efficiency 
enables organizations to identify and address vulnerabilities quickly, reducing 
the window of exposure to potential cyber threats. Further, as businesses 
expand and technology infrastructures grow more intricate, the scalability of 
autonomous penetration testing becomes crucial. 

Adaptability to Evolving Threats: The cybersecurity landscape is dynamic 
and constantly changing, with new threats emerging daily. NodeZero enables 
customers to proactively illuminate new threats and improve their ability to 
detect and assess vulnerabilities effectively.

 Risk Prioritization: NodeZero doesn’t just tell our customers what it found; it 
prioritizes vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact on the 
organization. This helps security teams focus their efforts on addressing the 
most critical vulnerabilities first, optimizing resource allocation.

 Reduced Human Error: Traditional penetration testing relies heavily on manual 
processes, making it susceptible to human error. Testing your environment 
with NodeZero minimizes such errors by automating routine tasks, ensuring 
consistent and thorough security assessments, with the ability to compare 
pentest results.

Cost\-effectiveness:The efficiency, speed, and scalability of NodeZero can lead 
to overall cost savings compared to manual testing, especially for organizations 
with large and complex IT infrastructures.

 Compliance Assurance: Many industries and sectors are subject to strict 
regulatory compliance requirements. NodeZero helps organizations meet and 
exceed these standards by providing continuous and comprehensive security 
assessments, demonstrating a commitment to cybersecurity best practices.

2023 YEAR IN REVIEW

Observations of the Challenges Organizations Continue to Face

Since last year’s review, we consistently observe that 
security teams, tools, and policies all require constant 
tuning and enforcement. The data from last year also 
shows that customers who frequently attack their 
environment as malicious cyber threat actors would 
confirmthattheirsecuritypostureiseffective. 
Our customers continue to do exactly that. They consistently 
and comprehensively assessed their individual environments 
using NodeZero, identified vulnerabilities, and took corrective 
measures to preemptively enhance their security stance and 
harden their attack surface. 

By looking Through the Eyes of an Attacker, we have 
observed three predominant challenges in the past year: 

• Credentials are still the number one issue
•Unpatchedandmisconfiguredsoftwareareprime

targets for cyber attackers

• Fine\-tuning security tools and staying ahead of 

emerging threats are imperative

Repeatedly, we have seen these challenges permeate a 
customer’s environment. Conversely, we’ve seen each of 
these challenges reduced when a security professional sees 
the results and impacts of a potential attack as an attacker 
would. When security vulnerabilities are not only exposed 
but prioritized based on what to fix first, the impacts of easily 
compromised credentials, exposed data, misconfigurations, 
poor security controls, and weak policies are made relevant 
and real. Those same security practitioners are now 
empowered to proactively thwart potential threats 
immediately and continuously with NodeZero. 

The result is customers patching and rerunning a pentest to 
verify that they remediated that remote code execution (RCE) 
vulnerability, or revamping old password policies and Identity 
Access and Management (IAM) solutions to shore up weak 
or default credential vulnerabilities. Moreover, it allows them 
to fine\-tune their current security tools to detect, log, alert, 
and stop techniques like password spray, credential dumping, 
brute force attacks, or credential stuffing, for example.

This report will focus on these three challenges and show you 
how weaknesses NodeZero illuminated and exploited over 
the past year led to critical impacts, deeper implications, and 
positive action by the customer to remediate vulnerabilities 
and weaknesses.

CHALLENGE 1: 
Credentials are Still the 
Number One Issue

As the trend remains from last year, cyber threat actors don’t typically 
use sophisticated hacking tools and techniques like zero\-day exploits 
to gain access to a network; they simply log in with legitimated user 
credentials. Once they gain initial access, threat actors then appear as 
legitimate users and can move laterally within a network to gain further 
access and establish persistence, steal sensitive data, bring down systems, 
and/or hold the organization hostage through ransomware.

We know that nefarious actors exploit credential requirements in many 
ways. They can:

Highlighted by one of our 
customers in a recent 
case study, 

Some things like 
service accounts 
and similar had 
slipped through 
the cracks. Our 
IT and admin 
accounts were not 
subject to quarterly 
password resets, 
so NodeZero helped 
usfigureoutthose
accounts, keeping 
us in the know.

• Take advantage of weak password strength requirements or 

weak account lockout thresholds

• Capture and then crack hashes

• Take advantage of accounts that reuse compromised 

credentials

• Use the default credentials that remain unchanged in a variety 

of web applications and systems processes

But How Did They Get in to My Admin Account?

One primary reason for this issue is pre\-configured default 
username and passwords loaded on devices and systems when 
they arrive from the manufacturer, often for convenience reasons 
during the initial setup process. Manufacturers and vendors may 
use generic credentials to simplify deployment, but organizations 
often neglect to change these defaults, assuming they provide 
sufficient security and that they are the only ones accessing the 
system. Recent publicly exploitable RCE vulnerabilities, such 
as Ivanti Connect Secure CVE\-2024\-21887, highlight that this 
is flawed logic, showing that attackers can exploit vulnerable software to 
access networks and systems remotely using stolen credentials. 

Additionally, there’s a tendency among administrative users to choose weak 
passwords or reuse the same passwords across multiple accounts, creating 
vulnerabilities that malicious actors can and have exploited. Also, some 
levels of admin or IT type accounts are not always subject to password reset 
or length policy requirements. This lax approach to credential management 
could stem from a lack of awareness about the 
potential risks and the importance of robust 
security practices.

Threat 
Intelligence 

Credential attacks, such as Password spray, serve as a gateway for 
threat actors to infiltrate a system and allow for follow\-on attacks. In a 
recent attack in 2023, state\-backed threat actor Midnight Blizzard aka 
Nobelium utilized the password spray technique – using a list of publicly 
available, common weak or default credentials – to gain a foothold into 
targeted Microsoft systems, while enabling them to move laterally 
and avoiding detection. We have seen repeatedly that weak or default 
credentials can be the downfall of any organization regardless of size. 
This underscores the critical role of password spray attacks in providing 
malicious actors with an initial entry point, allowing them to exploit 
vulnerabilities and compromise the security of the targeted system.

Furthermore, some cyber threat actors may go to the extent of purchasing cleartext 
credentials that are accessible on the dark web. Upon obtaining initial access, these 
threat actors assume the guise of legitimate users, enabling them to traverse laterally 
within a network to acquire additional access and establish persistence. This may 
involve actions such as stealing sensitive data, compromising systems, or subjecting the 
organization to ransomware, effectively holding it hostage.

For instance, when one of our cybersecurity consulting customers launched NodeZero in 
their environment, it illuminated nearly 1400 discovered credentials, with almost half 
in the critical category (local domain admin, local user, domain admin), allowing access to 
4\.6Mrestrictedandsensitivefiles. The attack path below shows injected credentials 
for a regular domain user account found on the network that had local administrator 
privileges on a machine. NodeZero was able to verify the cleartext password discovered 
and log into the SMB service and exploit Windows Print Spooler RCE vulnerability 
CVE\-2021\-34527 as an authenticated user with local admin privileges, leading to domain 
compromise, domain user compromise, and host compromise. NodeZero then loaded a 
Remote Access Tool (RAT) on a host using the domain admin cleartext credentials on a 
specific domain to enable post\-exploitation by abusing CVE\-2021\-34527\.

password and the NodeZero RAT.

Furthermore, NodeZero compromised the domain 
administrator accounts for 20\+ other accounts in 
the domain. These accounts have unlimited access 
within the domain and can perform sensitive 
actions such as reading all employee email, 
accessing business data, or disabling the entire 
company’s access to the network. This is just one 
example of how attackers can exploit weak or 
default credentials to carry out privileged actions 
such as dumping credentials, disabling anti\-virus, 
and adding accounts.

Another contributing factor is the complexity 
of managing many credentials across various 
platforms and applications within an organization. 

With numerous systems in use, from email 
servers to cloud platforms and databases, 
administrators may struggle to enforce strong 
credential policies consistently. This challenge 
is exacerbated by employees who may resist 
stringent password requirements, opting for 
simplicity over security. The failure to implement 
multifactor authentication (MFA) in many 
instances amplifies the consequences of weak 
credentials. As cyber threats constantly evolve, 
organizations must address these issues through 
education, strict password policies, and the 
widespread adoption of MFA to mitigate the risks 
associated with default of weak credentials. 

Implications of 
Credential\-based Attacks

NodeZero continues to achieve critical impacts across multiple pentests within 
every industry, daily. These critical impacts include domain compromise, host 
compromise, sensitive data exposure, critical infrastructure compromise, or 
ransomware exposure. Addressing the impacts stemming from chained weaknesses 
in the customer’s environment is crucial, but it’s equally important to tackle the root 
systemic issues that contribute to these challenges. Through our interactions with 
customers and observations within the NodeZero portal, it is evident that numerous 
companies and organizations still struggle with inadequate implementation and 
enforcement of authentication and credential policies. 

As described by one of our customers, “we thought we were doing a good job by 
following established IAM guidelines and policies, however, when NodeZero was 
introduced into our environment, we quickly discovered that’s not necessarily true.” 
It is essential to rectify these issues and implement better policies to enable a robust 
and resilient security environment. This also leads us to ask whether the security 
tools that our customers have in place are working and are effective in detecting, 
logging, alerting, and stopping these threats from achieving a critical impact.

Policy Recommendations and 
Mitigation Actions

Fortunately, there are simple changes that can 
be made within an organization to help prevent 
credential\-based attacks:
• Increase training for employees on basic cyber 
security, including the dangers of credential 
reuse and weak or easily guessed passwords. 
Additionally, for your privileged admins, 
implement a Local Administrator Password 
Solution (LAPS) solution to help organizations 
prevent local admin credential reuse.
• Institute password policies that include 

sophistication and length requirements as 
described in the latest recommendations from 
NIST Special Publication 800\-63B to include:
• All passwords must be 12 characters 

or longer

• No passwords matching the list of known 

breached passwords

• No passwords derived from dictionary terms
• No passwords derived from well\-known 

contextual terms such as the company name, 
product, etc.

• No passwords derived from well\-known 
information about the user such as the 
username, first name, or last name
• All passwords should be unique, and 

no passwords should be “too similar” to 
each other

• When creating a temporary password for a new 
user or a user that requires an account unlock, 
require the password to be used within 
a specific timeframe before the account 
becomes disabled.

• Require the use of multifactor authentication 
for logging into external environments and 
segmented networks when possible. This 
ensures a high degree of certainty that a cyber 
threat actor will not be able to gain access to 
public facing instances unless they also have 

12

control of the second device, such as a 
registered cellphone or other device to confirm a 
login attempt.
• There are a variety of tools to set and enforce 
password policy. For instance, if you’re using 
Azure AD, you can enable Azure AD Password 
Protection to automatically ban well\-known 
bad passwords. Of note, password managers 
are good, but don’t store your MFA tokens in 
your password manager!

• Implement a configuration management 

process that directs default credentials are 
changed before systems are deployed in a 
production environment.

• Implement good access controls to include 

the principle of “least privilege.” Users should 
only have access to specific data, resources, 
and applications needed to complete required 
tasks within their role. This can help ensure that 
organizations are limiting their overall attack 
surface, while improving their security posture 
and reduce “over privileged” users that could 
misuse critical systems and increase liability.

• Disable the accounts of current or former 
employees who no longer require access. 
Oftentimes, cyber threat actors are disgruntled 
employees or former employees that would 
like to seek retribution against an organization 
and already have access. Disabling and not 
deleting the former user account allows the 
organization to retain any files or data that 
individuals may have generated while limiting 
the organization’s risk.

• And lastly, verify that each of the above 

guidelines are implemented, enforced, and 
effective by attacking your environmental teams, 
tools, and rules using the NodeZero AD Password 
Audit or Phishing Impact test.

CHALLENGE 2: 
Unpatched and Misconfigured 
Software Are Prime Targets for 
Cyber Attackers

Throughout the past year, numerous Horizon3\.ai customers have conducted 
pentests, only to discover that their systems are riddled with recent exploitable 
vulnerabilities and some dating back several years. Astonishingly, many of these 
vulnerabilities have simple fixes and/or patches readily available by vendors, 
underscoring the critical importance of regularly updating and applying patches to 
ensure system security. This includes vulnerabilities from CISA’s current Top Routinely 
Exploited Vulnerabilities list and their Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. 

We had just completed our own 
penetration test and I was super 
underwhelmed. Our scoring was low 
and there was nothing critical to 
report.ThenwekickedoffNodeZero,
did a scan of our environment, 
and within a few hours we found a 
systemthatwasnotfullyconfigured.
As a result, NodeZero was able to 
compromise it, then move laterally 
through the environment, and ended 
up compromising our whole domain.

\- Calvin Engen, CTO at F12\.net

Moreover, customers often discovered that 
they have added software and hardware 
to their environments that was improperly 
configured and/or had default settings 
enabled. Software misconfigurations, if left 
alone, present a significant security risk to 
the entire environment. Most commonly, 
misconfigurations include default settings, 
insecure configurations, or overlooked 
security measures. Also, software 
misconfigurations create an environment 
ripe for exploitation by cyber attackers. 
Attackers actively search for known 
vulnerabilities in software configurations, 
leveraging automated tools and techniques 
to identify and exploit weaknesses. 

14

2023 YEAR IN REVIEW

Observations of the Challenges Organizations Continue to Face

According to the NSA and CISA, 
the top 10 most prevalent 
networkmisconfigurationsare:

 1\. Default configurations of 
software and applications

 2\. Improper separation of user/

administrator privilege

 3\. Insufficient internal network 

monitoring

 4\. Lack of network segmentation

 5\. Poor patch management

 6\. Bypass of system access 

controls

 7\. Weak or misconfigured 

multifactor authentication 
(MFA) methods

 8\. Insufficient access control lists 

(ACLs) on network shares and 
services

 9\. Poor credential hygiene

10\. Unrestricted code execution

Figure 8 Discover your internal attack 

surface using the NodeZero Network 

Enumeration test.

In many cases, exploit scripts are readily available on 
the internet, allowing even novice attackers to launch 
sophisticated attacks against vulnerable systems. By 
exploiting misconfigurations, attackers can execute a 
variety of malicious activities, including unauthorized data 
access, privilege escalation, and system compromise. 
Therefore, timely patching and proper configuration 
management are critical to mitigating the risk posed by 
software misconfigurations and maintaining a secure 
computing environment. 

It is also key to know your attack surface in and out. The 
NodeZero targeted Network Enumeration test serves as 
a critical reconnaissance technique for our customers, 
offering insights into an organization’s attack surface 
by systematically discovering and cataloging network 
assets and services. Through the Network Enumeration 
test, security teams can meticulously map out their 
infrastructure, identifying open ports, active hosts, and 
network protocols. 

This test helps unveil potential entry points, insufficient 
network segmentation, and weak spots that malicious 
actors could exploit to infiltrate the network, as well as any 
misconfigurations that need addressed. By comprehensively 
understanding the attack surface, our customers can 
prioritize security measures, fortify defenses, and 
proactively mitigate risks. The Network Enumeration test 
not only aids in bolstering the resilience of the network 
but also empowers security teams to stay one step ahead 
of adversaries by proactively addressing vulnerabilities, 
discovering shadow IT devices, and minimizing the likelihood 
of successful cyber\-attacks.

The Importance of Ensuring the 
Security, Reliability, Resilience, and 
Hardening of your Landscape

Much like last year, NodeZero continues to find and exploit misconfigurations 
and vulnerabilities in critical DevOps tools (i.e., Jenkins, GitLab, Kubernetes, 
and Docker), routers, servers, Integrated Lights Out (iLOs), and Integrated Dell 
Remote Access (iDRACs). Compromised DevOps tools can lead to unauthorized 
access to sensitive code repositories, injection of malicious code into production 
environments, and distribution of malware, posing a significant threat to data 
integrity and operational continuity. 

Threat 
Intelligence 

In 2023, DevOps Tools such as Jenkins, GitLab, Kubernetes, and Docker still 
have security vulnerabilities and are targeted due to their widespread usage 
in software development and deployment.

For instance, in Mar 2023 Jenkins encountered severe security issues 
related to plugin vulnerabilities allowing a threat actor to initiate cross\-
site scripting (XSS) attacks and gain unauthorized access and complete 
compromise of the Jenkins server3\. 

GitLab also faced similar security challenges in the past year, when a 
financially motivated operation dubbed LABRAT, enabled an attacker to 
use stealthy and defensive evasion in their attacks. The attacker utilized 
undetected signature\-based tools, sophisticated and stealthy cross\-
platform malware, command and control (C2\) tools which bypassed firewalls, 
and kernel\-based rootkits to hide their presence. Moreover, the attacker 
used a legitimate service, TryCloudFlare, to obfuscate their C2 network4\.

To mitigate these types of vulnerabilities in DevOps tools, it’s crucial for 
organizations to stay informed about the latest security advisories and to 
implement security best practices such as regular patching, least privilege 
access controls, network segmentation, and container image scanning 
can help strengthen DevOps pipelines and containerized environments. 
Additionally, leveraging security tools and running NodeZero continuously 
harnesses the Find, Fix, Verify loop, identifying and remediating potential 
vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them.

Similarly, vulnerabilities in networking components can grant attackers 
unauthorized access, control over network traffic, and the ability to disrupt 
essential services, compromising confidentiality, availability, and integrity 
of the network. NodeZero users are keenly aware of the importance for 
them to promptly address these misconfigurations to mitigate potential 
cyber threats and ensure the security, reliability, resilience, and hardening 
of their IT infrastructure.

For example, one of our major customers in the food and beverage arena 
discovered an authentication bypass and execution of code vulnerability 
in their HPE iLO 4 instance (CVE\-2017\-12542\), leveraged in 6 additional 
attacks paths leading to Host Compromise. NodeZero also highlighted that 
this vulnerability led to 5 critical downstream impacts and the discovery of 
cleartext ‘local administrator’ password, with access to the SSH service.

Figure 9

control of the vulnerable server, as well as viewing the cleartext passwords 
of all users. Further, host compromise can lead to attackers gaining access 
to sensitive information, maintaining persistence within your network, and 
obtaining lateral movement within your networks. While many companies 
or organizations may choose to leave their servers unpatched, Horizon3\.ai 
customers are realizing the consequences of this and are urged to protect 
against the bypass of authentication.

Observations of the Challenges Organizations Continue to Face

Legacy Systems Continue 
to Remain a Threat

Although NodeZero keeps pace with emerging threats, legacy 
vulnerabilities still plague organizations every day. This is 
especially true when NodeZero users running legacy systems 
and software in their environment discover vulnerabilities 
dating back to 2008 that are still being exploited by threat 
actors. As we have seen, many organizations struggle to keep 
up with the constant stream of security patches and updates 
released. Legacy systems may be difficult to patch due to 
compatibility issues or because they are no longer supported 
by vendors, creating a window of opportunity for attackers to 
exploit known vulnerabilities. 

Figure 10 Attack path 
shows NodeZero discovery 
of CVE\-2017\-0144 leading 
to host compromise and 
sensitive data exposure.

For example, NodeZero discovered EternalBlue CVE\-2017\-0144 multiple times in one 
of our cybersecurity services partner environments, leading to host compromise and 
sensitive data exposure to \~14M protected files. EternalBlue is a legacy Windows SMB 
RCE vulnerability that exists when the Microsoft Server Message Block 1\.0 (SMBv1\) 
server handles certain requests. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending 
a specially crafted packet to the SMBv1 server. This would then give the attacker the 
ability to execute code on that targeted SMBv1 server. As we saw in a recent test 
\[Figures 10 \& 11], EternalBlue was leveraged by NodeZero and used to achieve host 
compromise and sensitive data exposure impacts across the entire network. Host 
compromise can lead to attackers gaining access to sensitive information, maintaining 
persistence within your network, and obtaining lateral movement within your networks, 
while sensitive data exposures can be used to obtain user credentials, personally 
identifiable information (PII), financial account data, and other business\-critical 
information to further exploit or gain profit.

Figure 11 Sankey chart highlights top weaknesses and 

impacts, showing that EternalBlue led to 402 sensitive 

data exposure and 1060 host compromise impacts.

Fortunately for our customer, NodeZero found the vulnerability 
before an attacker could target their network/systems and provided 
them with mitigations to prevent such an attack from occurring in 
the future. In this instance, they were directed to apply the updates 
referenced in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17\-010 and block access 
to SMB services from untrusted networks such as the Internet, as 
well as disabling SMBv1 if possible.

Threat 
Intelligence 

Old CVEs such as EternalBlue (CVE\-2017\-0144\) and BlueKeep 
(CVE\-2019\-0708\) remain relevant due to their persistence in unpatched 
or legacy systems and their potential for widespread exploitation. Despite 
patches being available for these vulnerabilities, many organizations fail 
to apply them promptly, leaving systems vulnerable to exploitation. Cyber 
threat groups, including but not limited to nation\-state actors like the 
North Korean Lazarus Group and Russian APT28 (Fancy Bear), have utilized 
EternalBlue for high\-profile attacks such as the WannaCry ransomware 
outbreak in 2017 and various campaigns targeting critical infrastructure 
and government entities. Similarly, BlueKeep has been exploited by threat 
actors like the Chinese Hafnium group to compromise vulnerable systems 
and launch subsequent attacks. These examples underscore the ongoing 
relevance of old CVEs and the critical need for organizations to prioritize 
patch management and security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation.

Implications of Failures to 
Patch and Misconfigurations

When NodeZero exploits these vulnerabilities and misconfigurations 
as an attacker would, especially when they are strung together to 
reach critical impacts, it tells us a few things about the organization 
and its environment:

1\. Companies and organizations may be having trouble implementing 

patching policies that keep their systems up\-to\-date, and 
that previous vulnerabilities remain unmitigated. Some of the 
vulnerabilities we briefly discussed are over five years old, have been 
found on multiple machines, and have published vendor fixes and/
or mitigation actions readily available. All organizations need to do is 
apply the patches or mitigation actions and confirm they are fixed.

Observations of the Challenges Organizations Continue to Face

2\. The customer may also be having difficulty prioritizing what needs to be fixed. The 

organization’s security team might be spending time patching and fixing vulnerabilities 
that may not actually be exploitable within their environment or have a lower criticality 
than those that will lead to critical impacts like host compromise, domain compromise, or 
ransomware exposure. Meaning, they aren’t prioritizing and fixing what actually matters.

3\. An organization may have legacy systems that are not able to be patched to the latest 

version, because of certain incompatibility issues with other technologies on the network. 
In those cases, the systems that cannot be upgraded or patched need to be segmented 
from the rest of the environment. This will limit any impact that a threat actor would have 
if it were able to exploit the vulnerability on that specific machine.

4\. IT departments may have issues configuring new hardware like routers when adding them 
to the network. Too often we find that customers discover new hardware was added to 
their network with default settings and passwords that are made available on the open 
web, making it easily exploitable for any nefarious actor who would come across it.

Policy Recommendations and 
Mitigation Actions Misconfigurations

When it comes to preventing cyber threat actors from taking advantage of known 
vulnerabilities and weaknesses, Horizon3\.ai recommends instituting patching and 
mitigation policies to keep your systems as up to date as possible. We recognize that not 
all technologies can be patched due to the risk of disrupting other components within the 
environment. In those cases, we recommend implementing vendor\-approved fix actions and 
mitigation strategies to prevent the vulnerability from being exploited in your environment. 
If those fix action or mitigation strategies are still not available to you, we recommend 
segmenting that machine from the rest of your environment to prevent a malicious actor 
from reaching other portions of your environment and achieving critical impacts.

Of course, we do not suggest patching or implementing fix actions and merely moving on. 
Instead, organizations need to verify that those patches and fix actions were implemented 
correctly and effectively. We suggest running a regular cadence of autonomous pentests 
with NodeZero within your environment to do just that. In doing so, NodeZero can find 
those exploitable vulnerabilities and weaknesses that may still be in your environment, 
fix those vulnerabilities and weaknesses, and verify that the fix and mitigation actions 
were successful. Further, by continuously running this Find, Fix, Verify loop, security 
professionals are also able to keep abreast of any changes to ensure that those same 
(or new) exploitable vulnerabilities and weaknesses don’t creep into the environment.

CHALLENGE 3: 
Fine\-Tuning Security Tools and 
Staying Ahead of Emerging 
Threats Are Imperative

Did we detect it? Did we alert on it? Did we stop it? Did we log it?

We consistently 
see that it is not 
necessarily the 
tool itself that 
failed, but rather 
it is a failure of 
configuringthe
tool properly.

A recurring sentiment voiced by Horizon3\.ai customers is the frustration 
surrounding their investment in Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) 
solutions. Many express dissatisfactions with spending considerable 
resources on EDR solutions, only to find that they did not detect, alert, 
stop, and log the right actions immediately. Such inefficiencies 
prompt questions about an organization’s capacity to 
identify malicious actors, efficiently log events, promptly alert 
cybersecurity personnel, and prevent threat actors from carrying 
out malicious activities. 

This understanding emerges as our customers adopt an 
attacker’s perspective through NodeZero. Customers gain 
actionable insights into the TTPs employed by threat actors, such 
as Man\-in\-the\-Middle attacks (NTLM relay) or privilege escalation 
vectors (Kerberoasting), along with crucial data like timestamps, 
to uncover exploits and attack paths pointing to how threat 
actors could achieve significant impacts. When our customers 
continuously assess their cyber environment with NodeZero, it allows 
them to gain an understanding into emerging threats, vulnerabilities, 
and attack patterns, thereby enabling them to fine\-tune their current 
cybersecurity suite effectively. This can also help pinpoint areas 
where current cybersecurity tools are falling short or where additional 
protections are needed to mitigate risks effectively.

Moreover, continuous assessments provide valuable data and feedback 
loops that empower our customers to optimize the configuration, 
performance, and efficacy of their cybersecurity tools. By correlating 
findings from their pentests with real\-world security incidents and 
threat intelligence, they can refine detection thresholds, update rule 
sets, and implement proactive defenses to better detect, alert, prevent, 
and respond to cyber threats. This iterative process of implementing 
NodeZero to help empower customers in fine\-tuning cybersecurity tools 
ensures that they remain aligned with evolving threats and organizational 
needs, while enhancing overall security 
posture and resilience against cyber attacks.

Research and Development Enables 
Readiness and Resilience 

Think of NodeZero as 
a Resiliency Test for 
your Organization 

Art Ocain, CISO at Airiam

In tandem with in\-house vulnerability research 
and exploitation, our engineers and researchers 
use comprehensive industry information 
(i.e., CISA, NIST, and/or similar) to prioritize 
and enhance NodeZero’s attack content. 

Additionally, Horizon3\.ai takes a targeted 
approach to new zero\-day and N\-day threats as 
they emerge through our rapid response alerts, 
allowing our customers to test whether they 
are impacted and preemptively secure against 
them. Our teams also conduct thorough open\-
source research to determine what vulnerabilities 
are actively being exploited by threat actors in 
the wild and what vulnerabilities may impact 
our customers. When we identify high value 
vulnerabilities, the Horizon3\.ai Attack Team often 
reverse\-engineers them and creates proof\-of\-
concept (PoC) exploits to enable NodeZero to 
demonstrate the true impact of the vulnerability 
in your network. 

As explained by one of our customers, Art Ocain, 
Airiam’s CISO \& Strategic Alliances and Incident 
Response Product Management Lead, “the idea 
of the attack team keeping everything completely 
up to date when there’s a new vulnerability 
\[CVE] release while also doing their own PoC and 
building it into the system” is a game\-changer. 
“You’re not going to see other products turning a 
vulnerability into an exploit in less than a month…
that blew me away,” he added. 

Why does this matter to our customers? The 
in\-depth research and development conducted 
by our teams empower any user of NodeZero to 
take back their network, allowing them to be ready 
for and stay ahead of attackers.

Rapid Response Program 

Zero\-Day vulnerabilities drive fear within the cyber community, because they often 
have a severe impact due to their unknown nature. Adversaries can take full advantage 
of exploiting Zero\-Day vulnerabilities until they are discovered and disclosed publicly, 
and patches or mitigation measures are developed and made available.

Conversely, N\-Day vulnerabilities often pose a much larger threat because they 
may or may not have readily available fix actions but are publicly known and leave 
organizations exposed until patches or mitigations are shared. According to Dark 
Reading5, “N\-day vulnerabilities are a goldmine for attackers because the hard work has 
already been done.” 

Horizon3\.ai is keenly aware of the threat both Zero\-Day and N\-Day vulnerabilities 
pose to our customers, which is why we created rapid response alerts to combat such 
dangers. Our Rapid Response alerts aim to:

1\. Quickly integrate Zero\-Day and N\-Day attack content into NodeZero

2\. Proactively identify and notify our prospects, customers, and partners that are 

likely at risk or known to be exploitable

3\. Enable those customers the ability to run a targeted pentest to verify they are no 
longer exploitable or quickly run a retest to verify the issue has been remediated

4\. Work with our partners to ensure they continue to be positioned as trusted 

advisors to their customers

We often alert our customers to newly released 
vulnerabilities through our rapid response 
notifications. These notifications focus on 
any potentially exploitable instances in their 
environment while including the availability 
of patches and fix actions to remediate the 
weakness, and the ability to run a pentest 
to verify that the corrective actions were 
successful. We also ensure that our customers 
stay up to date on any developments on the 
specific vulnerability, such as the ongoing 
exploitation by malicious cyber threat actors in 
the wild. This not only facilitates cybersecurity 
professionals with a full understanding of what 
vulnerabilities are being actively exploited in 
their environment, but what fix actions to take 
first to mitigate threats proactively.

Implications and Policy 
Recommendations

As customers continue to proactively illuminate their 
environments by running a regular cadence of pentests and 
utilizing the Find, Fix, Verify loop, we often find that their 
security teams still ask why NodeZero was able to achieve 
critical impacts when they have security tools in place that 
should be able to stop the threat. This implies that the security 
team was unable to proactively detect, alert, stop, and log 
threats before they materialize with the security tools they have 
in place.

Although we do not recommend or endorse any other specific 
cybersecurity tools beyond NodeZero, companies should 
conduct thorough research and evaluation. They should identify 
their specific security needs, considering factors such as the 
size of their organization, the complexity of their IT environment, 
and the types of threats they are most concerned about or that 
NodeZero has discovered and exploited. Also, companies should 
assess EDR solutions based on key criteria such as detection 
capabilities, real\-time monitoring, response automation, and 
integration with existing security infrastructure. It’s crucial 
to evaluate the accuracy and efficacy of threat detection 
algorithms, the speed and granularity of alerting mechanisms, 
and the comprehensiveness of response actions offered by the 
EDR tool. 

Additionally, companies should consider factors like ease 
of deployment, scalability, vendor support, and regulatory 
compliance requirements. Further, they should conduct 
thorough testing and pilot programs to ensure that the selected 
EDR tool aligns with their security objectives and effectively 
addresses their threat landscape. Regular updates, continuous 
monitoring, and ongoing optimization are essential to maximize 
the effectiveness of EDR tools in proactively identifying and 
mitigating security threats.

Conclusion

We have seen that Horizon3\.ai customers of all 
sizes have found exploitable critical vulnerabilities, 
misconfigurations, and weaknesses in their 
environments thanks to NodeZero. 
We have also seen that these vulnerabilities, 
misconfigurations,andweaknesses
consistently fall into three general themes:

1\. Weak or default credentials and poor policy 

enforcement, not sophisticated exploits, lead to 
most of the common weaknesses experienced 
by our customers. Credential\-based attacks 
are the most common method for cyber threat 
actors to gain a foothold in your environment, 
and yet are often easily fixed.

2\. Unpatched and misconfigured software 

remains a prime target for threat actors to 
exploit. Companies and organizations should 
continuously implement patching policies 
to ensure that their environment is up to 
date and resilient, while also confirming that 
their environment is configured properly and 
hardened against cyber\-attacks.

3\. Cybersecurity tools require proper oversight 

and fine\-tuning to be effective, especially when 
up against emerging threats like Zero\-Day and 
N\-Day vulnerabilities.

It is not enough to simply employ security 
tools and think that they will prevent the next 
cyberattack without regularly assessing the 
efficacy of those tools in your environment using 
NodeZero. Companies and organizations that 
constantly ensure that their cybersecurity tools 
are configured properly enable their security 
teams to proactively detect, alert, stop and log a 
threat before it’s too late.

We have consistently found that taking 
the hacker’s perspective by continuously 
attacking our own environments with 
NodeZero and running the Find, Fix, Verify 
loop is essential to understanding if we 
are truly secure or not.

NodeZero permits our customers to take the 
necessary steps to prioritize and fix or mitigate 
those vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and 
weaknesses that lead to critical impacts. This 
includes pointing our customers to the latest 
patches and mitigation actions by individual 
vendors. Once the vulnerabilities are believed 
to be fixed or mitigated, our customers are then 
asked to run another pentest or 1\-click verify. 
This ensures that the fix actions and mitigation 
steps were applied correctly.

OVER THE HORIZON 
What’s Next for NodeZero?

As cybersecurity professionals, we believe we should always be iterating, learning, and adapting 
to illuminate and combat new threats. Our approach to building NodeZero is no different. 
Our teams at Horizon3\.ai are constantly working to proactively assess the ever\-changing cyber 
threat landscape, while also integrating customer feedback and developing new content. In 2024, 
we will remain committed as we put out new Internal and External attack content, iterate on our 
targeted pentest options (Network Enumeration, AD Password Audit, and Phishing), and strive to 
deliver a best\-in\-class overall user experience for our customers.
