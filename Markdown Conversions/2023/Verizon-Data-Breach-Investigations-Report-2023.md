About the cover
The magnifier on the cover is intended 
to visually convey the effort the team 
made to refocus our energy and 
resources more on our core breach 
dataset. The graph that is magnified 
is simply a cumulative count of the 
number of breaches in our dataset as 
the years have gone by since our first 
report. Long\-time readers may notice 
the Vocabulary for Event Recording 
and Incident Sharing (VERIS) 
Framework trademark honeycombs, 
which are meant to convey the 4As 
(Actor, Action, Asset, Attribute) 
and their various enumerations.

Helpful definitions 
and chart guidance

Hello, and welcome first\-time readers! Before you get 
started on the 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report 
(DBIR), it might be a good idea to take a look at this 
section first. (For those of you who are familiar with the 
report, please feel free to jump over to the introduction.) 
We have been doing this report for a while now, and we 
appreciate that the verbiage we use can be a bit obtuse 
at times. We use very deliberate naming conventions, 
terms and definitions and spend a lot of time making 
sure we are consistent throughout the report. Hopefully 
this section will help make all of those more familiar.

VERIS Framework resources
The terms “threat actions,” “threat actors” and “varieties” will be referenced often. 
These are part of the Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing (VERIS), 
a framework designed to allow for a consistent, unequivocal collection of security 
incident details. Here is how they should be interpreted:

Threat actor: Who is behind the event? This could be the external “bad guy” that 
launches a phishing campaign or an employee who leaves sensitive documents in 
their seat back pocket. 

Threat action: What tactics (actions) were used to affect an asset? VERIS uses 
seven primary categories of threat actions: Malware, Hacking, Social, Misuse, 
Physical, Error and Environmental. Examples at a high level include hacking a server, 
installing malware or influencing human behavior through a social attack. 

Variety: More specific enumerations of higher\-level categories—e.g., classifying the 
external “bad guy” as an organized criminal group1 or recording a hacking action as 
SQL injection or brute force.

examples and enumeration listings

• https://github.com/vz\-risk/veris—features information on the framework with

Incident vs. breach
We talk a lot about incidents 
and breaches and we use 
the following definitions:

Incident: A security event that 
compromises the integrity, 
confidentiality or availability of an 
information asset.

Breach: An incident that results in 
the confirmed disclosure—not just 
potential exposure—of data to an 
unauthorized party. A Distributed Denial 
of Service (DDoS) attack, for instance, 
is most often an incident rather than 
a breach, since no data is exfiltrated. 
That doesn’t make it any less serious.

Industry labels
We align with the North American 
Industry Classification System (NAICS) 
standard to categorize the victim 
organizations in our corpus. The 
standard uses two\- to six\-digit codes to 
classify businesses and organizations. 
Our analysis is typically done at the 
two\-digit level, and we will specify 
NAICS codes along with an industry 
label. For example, a chart with a label 
of Financial (52\) is not indicative of 52 
as a value. “52” is the NAICS code for 
the Financial and Insurance sector. 
The overall label of “Financial” is used 
for brevity within the figures. Detailed 
information on the codes and the 
classification system is available here: 

https://www.census.gov/
naics/?58967?yearbck\=2012

1 By organized criminal group, we mean a group that does this for a living and has a set process they 

use repeatedly, not Tony Soprano and his band of merry men.

2023 DBIR Helpful definitions and chart guidanceI’m sorry, this all 
happened when?
While we have always listed the 
following facts in our Methodology 
section (because that is where this type 
of information belongs), we decided to 
also mention it here for the benefit of 
those who don’t make it that far into the 
report. Each year, the DBIR timeline for 
in\-scope incidents is from November 
1 of one calendar year through 
October 31 of the next calendar 
year. Thus, the incidents described 
in this report took place between 
November 1, 2021, and October 
31, 2022\. The 2022 caseload is the 
primary analytical focus of the 2023 
report, but the entire range of data 
is referenced throughout, notably in 
trending graphs. The time between the 
latter date and the date of publication 
for this report is spent in acquiring 
the data from our global contributors, 
anonymizing and aggregating that 
data, analyzing the dataset and, 
finally, creating the graphics and 
writing the report. Rome wasn’t built 
in a day, and neither is the DBIR. 

Being confident of our data
Starting in 2019 with slanted bar 
charts, the DBIR has tried to make the 
point that the only certain thing about 
information security is that nothing is 
certain. Even with all the data we have, 
we’ll never know anything with absolute 
certainty. However, instead of throwing 
our hands up and complaining that it 
is impossible to measure anything in 
a data\-poor environment or, worse 
yet, just plain making stuff up, we get 
to work. This year, you’ll continue to 
see the team representing uncertainty 
throughout the report figures. 

The examples shown in Figures 1, 2, 3 
and 4 all convey the range of realities 
that could credibly be true. Whether 
it be the slant of the bar chart, the 
threads of the spaghetti chart, the 
dots of the dot plot or the color of 
the pictogram plot, all convey the 
uncertainty of our industry in their 
own special way. 

Much like the slanted bar chart, the 
spaghetti chart represents the same 
concept: the possible values that exist 
within the confidence interval; however, 
it’s slightly more involved because we 
have the added element of time. The 
individual threads represent a sample 
of all possible connections between 
the points that exists within each 
observation’s confidence interval. As 
you can see, some of the threads are 
looser than others, indicating a wider 
confidence internal and a smaller 
sample size. 

Figure 1\. Example slanted bar chart 
(n\=205\)

The slanted bar chart will be 
familiar to returning readers. The 
slant on the bar chart represents 
the uncertainty of that data point 
to a 95% confidence level (which is 
standard for statistical testing). 

In layman’s terms, if the slanted areas 
of two (or more) bars overlap, you can’t 
really say one is bigger than the other 
without angering the math gods. 

Figure 2\. Example spaghetti chart

2023 DBIR Helpful definitions and chart guidanceThe dot plot is another returning 
champion, and the trick to 
understanding this chart is to remember 
that the dots represent organizations. 
If, for instance, there are 200 dots (like 
in Figure 3\), each dot represents 0\.5% 
of organizations. This is a much better 
way of understanding how something 
is distributed among organizations 
and provides considerably more 
information than an average or a 
median. We added more colors and 
callouts to those in an attempt to 
make them even more informative. 

The pictogram plot, our relative 
newcomer, attempts to capture 
uncertainty in a similar way to slanted 
bar charts but is more suited for a 
single proportion. 

We hope they make your journey 
through this complex dataset even 
smoother than previous years. 

Figure 3\. Example dot plot (n\=672\). 
Each dot represents 0\.5% of 
organizations. Orange: lower half of 
80%. Yellow: upper half of 80%. 
Green: 80%–95%. Blue: Outliers. 
95% of orgs: 148–1,594,648\. 
80%: 1,274–438,499\. 
Median: 29,774 (log scale).

“Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.” 
 —attributed to Sir Winston Churchill

Hello and welcome old friends and new readers to the 2023 Verizon Data 
Breach Investigations Report! We are happy to have you join us once again as 
we take a look at the sordid underbelly of cybercrime and see what lessons we 
may collectively learn from doing so. It often seems that with every new defense 
strategy, appliance or Please\-Save\-Us\-As\-A\-Service we create, buy or borrow, our 
adversaries are just as quick to adapt and find a new vantage point from which to 
attack. While this state of affairs is already unfortunate enough, it becomes worse 
still when we do not even require them to evolve their tactics because the old ones 
still work just fine. 

Regardless of where we fall on the crazy\-secure to not\-so\-secure spectrum, the 
quote above is a good road map to cybersecurity (and life in general). This report 
aims to take a look at the times when things did not work as intended—not to 
point fingers but to help us all learn and improve. In a time where almost everyone, 
corporations and individuals alike, is looking at ways to do more with less, we believe 
a close analysis of when our defenses failed can be very beneficial. While times of 
great change are always challenging, they often also prompt us to take stock of our 
situation and, if necessary, refocus both our viewpoint and our energies. Such is 
the case with the DBIR this year. As a team, we decided to take a step back toward 
the fundamental things that got us where we are, an intense focus on actual data 
breaches analyzed using our own VERIS Framework. And speaking of VERIS, one 
of the new goodies this refocusing brings is an even better mapping between VERIS 
and MITRE ATT\&CK through a collaboration with MITRE Engenuity and the Center 
for Threat Informed Defense (CTID).2 It also helps that our parent organization, the 
Verizon Threat Research Advisory Center (VTRAC),3 shared the most breaches ever 
for us to analyze. Did you know it is VTRAC’s 20th anniversary this year? Save us a 
slice of that cake, boss!

As long\-time readers will know, over the past few years, we have increasingly utilized 
non\-incident data to add depth and dimension to our breach findings via various 
forms of research and analysis. While that remains a big part of what we do, as 
mentioned above, we did take purposeful steps toward a more direct focus on the 
breach side of the house this year. In short, the result of this was to make the report 
more concise and succinct and less unwieldy. This year we analyzed 16,312 security 
incidents, of which 5,199 were confirmed data breaches. As always, we hope you 
find this information informative, useful, easy to understand and actionable. 

Finally, we thank our global data contributors most sincerely, as this report would 
quite literally not be possible without them. Of course, the same can be said of our 
readers, so please accept our deep gratitude for your continued support. 

Sincerely,

The Verizon DBIR Team

Summary of findings

Figure 5\. Pretexting incidents over time

Social Engineering attacks are often 
very effective and extremely lucrative 
for cybercriminals. Perhaps this is 
why Business Email Compromise 
(BEC) attacks (which are in essence 
pretexting attacks) have almost doubled 
across our entire incident dataset, 
as can be seen in Figure 5, and now 
represent more than 50% of incidents 
within the Social Engineering pattern.

74% of all breaches include the 
human element, with people 
being involved either via Error, 
Privilege Misuse, Use of stolen 
credentials or Social Engineering. 

83% of breaches involved External 
actors, and the primary motivation for 
attacks continues to be overwhelmingly 
financially driven, at 95% of breaches. 

The three primary ways in which 
attackers access an organization 
are stolen credentials, phishing and 
exploitation of vulnerabilities.

Figure 8\. Ransomware action variety over time

Ransomware continues its reign as 
one of the top Action types present in 
breaches, and while it did not actually 
grow, it did hold statistically steady 
at 24%. Ransomware is ubiquitous 
among organizations of all sizes and 
in all industries. 

More than 32% of all Log4j scanning 
activity over the course of the year 
happened within 30 days of its release 
(with the biggest spike of activity 
occurring within 17 days).

Log4j was so top\-of\-mind in our data 
contributors’ incident response that 
90% of incidents with Exploit vuln as 
an action had “Log4j,” or “CVE\-2021\-
44228” in the comments section. 
However, only 20\.6% of the incidents 
had comments.

Results

Results 
and analysis: 
Introduction

Hello friends, and welcome to the “Results and analysis” section. This is where we 
cover the highlights we found in the data this year. This dataset is collected from a 
variety of sources, including our own VTRAC investigators, reports provided by our 
data contributors and publicly disclosed security incidents.

Since data contributors come and go, one of our priorities is to make sure we 
can get broad representation on different types of security incidents and the 
countries where they occur. This ebb and flow of contributors obviously influences 
our dataset, and we will do our best to provide context on those potential biases 
where applicable.

As some of you may have noticed4 over the years, the incident data collection we 
do is based on the VERIS Framework. It has been the bedrock upon which our 
multiyear dataset has been built and is what allows us to be able to speak with 
confidence when trends in the attack landscape surface. Our dataset currently 
contains 953,894 incidents, of which 254,968 are confirmed breaches, and we 
can’t wait to celebrate5 with you when we reach 1 million6 incidents!

In VERIS, the core categories we use to describe an incident are called the 4As: 
Actor (who), Action (how), Asset (where) and Attribute (what). An incident needs 
all these four to be “complete,” even if at the end of the day some of those are 
unknown to the parties investigating the incident. Keep an eye out for our instructive 
callouts in each of those sub\-sections giving more context on our VERIS categories.

Let’s go over the results for each one of these.

4 We certainly won’t shut up about it.
5 Not sure if we should be celebrating security incidents, but everyone loves a round number.
6 Here’s hoping being a millionaire doesn’t get to our dataset’s head, and they decide to join the “Great 

Resignation” and retire in some tropical tax haven.

Actors

Life can be scary and unpredictable, 
which is why we like to start our results 
discussion with the cozy and familiar 
Actor analysis. It really is true, as they 
say, that the only certainties in life are 
death, taxes and External actors.7

As Figure 11 demonstrates, External 
actors were responsible for 83% 
of breaches, while Internal ones 
account for 19%. It is worth reminding 
our readers that Internal actors are 
not only responsible for intentional 
harm in these cases, but they are 
also just as likely8 to be responsible 
for Error actions. Regardless, the 
clear frequency of External actors as 
instigators of breaches is a datapoint 
that has held steady ever since we 
started this gig.

Figure 11\. Threat actors in breaches 
(n\=5,177\)

Actor categories9

External: External threats 
originate from sources outside 
of the organization and its 
network of partners. Examples 
include criminal groups, lone 
hackers, former employees 
and government entities. This 
category also includes God 
(as in “acts of”), “Mother Nature” 
and random chance. Typically, 
no trust or privilege is implied 
for external entities.

Internal: Internal threats are 
those originating from within the 
organization. This encompasses 
company full\-time employees, 
independent contractors, interns 
and other staff. Insiders are 
trusted and privileged (some 
more than others).

Partner: Partners include any 
third party sharing a business 
relationship with the organization. 
This includes suppliers, vendors, 
hosting providers and outsourced 
IT support. Some level of trust 
and privilege is usually implied 
between business partners. Note 
that an attacker could use a 
partner as a vector, but that does 
not make the partner the Actor 
in this case. The partner has to 
initiate the incident.

7 That’s what they say, right?
8 OK, actually twice as likely.

Long\-time readers of the report will 
be similarly shocked to learn that 
Financial motives still drive the vast 
majority of breaches (Figure 12\), 
showing growth in relation to last year 
with a whopping 94\.6% representation 
in breaches. If we look inside to 
see which external actors are the 
hardest working, the top performer 
is Organized crime (Figure 13\). 

What is most interesting in Figure 
13, however, is realizing that the 
internal variety of End\-user shows 
up more often than the external 
variety State\-sponsored attackers.10 
Those organization employees are 
mostly involved in Misuse (read, 
internal malicious activity) and Errors 
(accidents), which suggests where we 
should be paying more attention on 
our day\-to\-day security management. 

This is relevant because we were 
expecting some increased activity 
in State\-sponsored attacks, be it 
Espionage\-related or not, due to the 
ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Even 
with anecdotal evidence of increased 
ideology or hacktivism\-related attacks 
stemming from the geopolitical 
discussion, it really isn’t making a dent 
in larger statistical terms. It is also 
worth noting that this kind of activity 
would also be unlikely to disrupt our 
average reader’s organization.11

Actions

Action, as the name would imply, 
is what brings dynamism to our 
report. What dastardly deeds have 
the threat actors been up to? If you 
replied “ransomware,” we’d say you 
have no imagination, but you would 
also be right. This pesky Malware 
variety has been holding our talking 
points hostage for years now, 
and we can’t scrounge up enough 
cryptocurrency to pay the ransom!

Figures 14, 15, 16 and 17 describe the 
top Action varieties (what happened 
in more detail) and vectors (how those 
actions came to pass). 

Action categories12 

Hacking (hak): attempts to 
intentionally access or harm 
information assets without (or 
exceeding) authorization by 
circumventing or thwarting 
logical security mechanisms. 

Malware (mal): any malicious 
software, script or code run on 
a device that alters its state or 
function without the owner’s 
informed consent. 

Error (err): anything done (or 
left undone) incorrectly 
or inadvertently. 

Social (soc): employ deception, 
manipulation, intimidation, etc., 
to exploit the human element, or 
users, of information assets. 

Misuse (mis): use of entrusted 
organizational resources or 
privileges for any purpose or 
manner contrary to that which 
was intended. 

Physical (phy): deliberate threats 
that involve proximity, possession 
or force. 

Environmental (env): not only 
includes natural events such 
as earthquakes and floods but 
also hazards associated with 
the immediate environment or 
infrastructure in which assets 
are located.

As expected, the charts are led by 
either first\-stage or single\-stage 
attacks, namely Use of stolen creds 
for breaches and Denial of Service 
for incidents. This is consistent with 
previous years. What is concerning, if 
unsurprising, is having Ransomware 
take over the second spot in incidents, 
now being present in 15\.5% of all 
incidents. Meanwhile, the share of 
Ransomware did not grow in breaches 
and held steady (statistically, at least) at 
24%. You can see the evolution of both 
in Figure 18\.

That almost a quarter of breaches 
involve a Ransomware step continues 
to be a staggering result. However, we 
had been anticipating that Ransomware 
would soon be hitting its theoretical 
ceiling, by which we mean that all the 
incidents that could have Ransomware, 
would have. Ransomware is present 
today in more than 62% of all incidents 
committed by Organized crime actors 
and in 59% of all incidents with a 
Financial motivation, so sadly there 
is still some room for growth.

Eagle\-eyed readers will notice the 
absence of Partner and Software 
update as action vectors for incidents 
this year, in contrast to last year’s 
“software supply chainpocalypse.”13 
Instead, our collective Christmas was 
ruined by another Ghost of Technical 
Debt Past: the Log4j vulnerability 
popularly known as CVE\-2021\-44228\.14

We will be spending some time digging 
into the Log4j vulnerability in the 
“System Intrusion” section, but it is 
worth noting that the presence of the 
Exploit vuln action has kept stable in 
incidents and is actually less prominent 
in breaches, dropping from 7% to 5%. 
So, did the collective security industry 
sacrifice its holidays for nothing? 

Figure 18\. Ransomware action variety over time

Not quite. This is one of those cases 
where the alternatives are just more 
popular. Use of stolen creds, our 
current champion, increased its share 
from 41\.6% to 44\.7%, which more than 
accounts for the drop in Exploit vuln.

More importantly, there was swift 
action from the community to 
spread awareness and patch all the 
different systems that had Log4j as a 
component. That surely helped avert a 
bigger disaster, so our success makes 
it look like it wasn’t a big deal after all.15 
In fact, Log4j was so top\-of\-mind in our 
data contributors’ incident response 
that 90% of incidents with Exploit vuln 
as an action had “Log4j,” or “CVE\-
2021\-44228” in the comments section. 
Granted, only 20\.6% of the incidents 
had comments at all,16 so even if it can’t 
fully represent the whole dataset, it 
certainly speaks to how significant the 
vulnerability was in late 2021 and early 
2022 for the incident response teams.

Finally, before I lose your attention, we 
should touch base on Loss.17 This action 
variety describes losing a physical 
device or media by accident and is 
often paired with the Carelessness 
action vector. It did show up fairly high 
in incidents. This is often because the 
data could not be confirmed as having 
been accessed and was therefore 
considered at risk rather than a breach. 
It is worth pointing out though that 
those were mostly concentrated in the 
data from some of our public sector 
contributors, where this sort of event 
is more tightly reported. Regardless, 
we know everyone was super excited 
about leaving the house again as the 
pandemic waned, but please keep an 
eye on your stuff when you go work 
from the coffee shop.

13 Wouldn’t you know, the moment we mention anything has not had relevance in our dataset, 

something new happens to remind us that change is the only constant. Best of luck for the teams 
responding to the 3CX supply\-chain breach in late March 2023 as we close out this section. Make 
sure to keep copious notes so we can talk about it in a future edition of the report.

14 Just rolls off the tongue, doesn’t it?
15 Who here was working on the Y2K bug? Don’t forget to schedule your shingles vaccine!
16 In everyone’s defense, most of the data sharing happening here is machine\-to\-machine. Long gone 

are the days of artisanal, bespoke, VERIS\-coded incidents for most of our contributors.

17 For the extremely online folks, we apologize for the psychic damage.

Assets

In case you just wandered out of an 
Accounting 101 class, our Assets are 
more than the numbers that you list on 
the left side of your balance sheet.18 
They encompass the entities that can 
be affected in an incident or breach and 
end up being manipulated by the threat 
actors for their nefarious goals. The 
callout box describes some of the most 
common top\-level Assets in VERIS 
and some of the most common attack 
patterns that target them.

Figure 19 has the breakdown of 
varieties of Assets affected in 
breaches, and the results are pretty 
much what would be expected given 
the focus of System Intrusion, Basic 
Web Application Attacks and Social 
Engineering as the top attack patterns 
this year. 

We can see a small fluctuation on 
the top three, as slightly less Servers 
were affected and slightly more User 
devices, but this order has held true for 
at least a couple of years, ever since 
Person overtook the second spot. Don’t 
forget that in VERIS, people are assets 
too,19 and they are the “where” that is 
affected by social threat actions.

Figure 19\. Assets in breaches 
(n\=4,433\)

Asset categories20

Server (srv): a device that performs 
functions of some sort supporting 
the organization, commonly without 
end\-user interaction. Where all the 
web applications, mail services, 
file servers and all that magical 
layer of information is generated. 
If someone has ever told you “the 
system is down,” rest assured that 
some Servers had their Availability 
impacted. Servers are common 
targets in almost all of the attack 
patterns, but especially in our System 
Intrusion, Basic Web Application 
Attacks, Miscellaneous Errors and 
Denial of Service patterns.

Person (per): the folks (hopefully) 
doing the work at the organization. 
No AI chat allowed. Different types of 

Person will be members of different 
departments and will have associated 
permissions and access in the 
organization stemming from this 
role. At the very least they will have 
access to their very own User device 
and their own hopes and dreams for 
the future. Person is a common target 
in the Social Engineering pattern.

User device (usr): the devices used 
by Persons to perform their work 
duties in the organizations. Usually 
manifested in the form of laptops, 
desktops, mobile phones and 
tablets. Common target in the 
System Intrusion pattern but also in 
the Lost and Stolen Asset pattern. 
People do like to take their little 
computers everywhere.

Network (net): not the concept, 
but the actual network computing 
devices that make the bits go around 
the world, such as routers, telephone 
and broadband equipment, and some 
of the traditional in\-line network 
security devices, such as firewalls 
and intrusion detection systems. Hey, 
Verizon is a Telecommunications 
company, OK?

Media (med): precious diluted data 
in its most pure and crystalline form. 
Just kidding, mostly thumb drives 
and actual printed documents. You 
will see the odd full disk drive and 
actual physical payment cards from 
time to time, but those are more 
rare. Common in the Lost and Stolen 
Assets pattern.

18 However, not caring for them properly could cause liabilities that would go on the right side.
19 Just ask your organization’s HR department.

For those keeping track, we had a 3\.4% 
showing of OT assets in breaches that 
declared their impact. In summary—
keep your attention level high, given the 
potential impact when those systems 
are affected, but either those numbers 
are very low overall, or they just don’t 
make it to our contributors’ dataset due 
to national22 security concerns. 

Breaking the Asset varieties down 
further in Figure 20 showcases Web 
application and Mail servers on top, as 
would be expected, but it is interesting 
to see Person \- Finance trending up 
from last year as we see a related 
growth in Pretexting social actions. 
We will be discussing those, and 
more specifically BECs, in the “Social 
Engineering” section of this report.

As a parting note, we continue to 
see very small numbers of incidents 
involving Operational Technology 
(OT), where the computers interface 
with heavy machinery and critical 
infrastructure, as contrasted with 
incidents involving Information 
Technology (IT), where we keep our 
cat pictures and internet memes. 
Industries like Manufacturing and 
Mining, Quarrying and Oil \& Gas 
Extraction \+ Utilities21 continue to 
be relatively well\-represented in our 
dataset, but reports of actual impact 
on OT devices are still too few for us to 
meaningfully write about in this report.

Attributes

The next time you meet an incident 
responder in the wild, know that all that 
goes through their mind is, “Did the 
asset or a copy of the data get out the 
door” (Confidentiality), “was it changed 
from a known and trusted state” 
(Integrity) and “do we still have access 
to it ourselves?” (Availability). Please 
offer them a word of kindness and a 
beverage, because it is a very tortured 
existence. If you are feeling cold, they 
are cold too.

One of the most interesting Attribute 
varieties we track year over year is the 
Confidentiality data varieties (Figure 
21\), or what kinds of data got out in 
a breach. Personal data represents 
Personally Identifiable Information 
(PII) from your customers, partners or 
employees, and it is the one that usually 
gets companies the most in trouble with 
regulators, as more and more privacy\-
related laws are passed around the 
world (although Medical data is a whole 
other ball of earwax). 

Virtual money, 
real problems

When VERIS describes Attributes, 
it is directly referencing the CIA 
triad in information security 
(InfoSec): Confidentiality, Integrity 
and Availability. It’s a tried\-and\-
true method of understanding the 
potential impact of an incident by 
describing what properties of the 
asset were potentially affected.

Attribute 
categories23

Confidentiality (cp): refers 
to limited observation and 
disclosure of an asset (or data). 
A loss of confidentiality implies 
that data were actually observed 
or disclosed to an unauthorized 
actor rather than endangered, 
at\-risk or potentially exposed 
(the latter fall under the attribute 
of Possession and Control). 
Short definition: limited access, 
observation and disclosure.

Integrity (ia): refers to an asset 
(or data) being complete and 
unchanged from the original or 
authorized state, content and 
function. Losses to integrity 
include unauthorized insertion, 
modification and manipulation. 
Short definition: complete and 
unchanged from original.

Availability (au): refers to an 
asset (or data) being present, 
accessible and ready for 
use when needed. Losses to 
availability include destruction, 
deletion, movement, performance 
impact (delay or acceleration) 
and interruption. Short definition: 
accessible and ready for use 
when needed.

Figure 21\. Top Confidentiality data 
varieties in breaches (n\=5,010\)

One data variety really caught the 
DBIR team’s attention this year: Virtual 
currency. We saw a fourfold increase 
this year in the number of breaches 
involving cryptocurrency from last 
year. That is a far cry from the days of 
innocence in 2020 and earlier, when we 
got one or two cases maximum each 
year. If our cartoon animal NFTs had 
these kinds of returns, we can assure 
you we would be living large and writing 
this report from our Lambos, not from 
our parents’ basements.24

Figures 23 and 24 show the top action 
varieties and vectors in breaches 
involving virtual currency, and it is a 
fierce competition between Exploit 
vulnerabilities, Use of stolen creds and 
Phishing. These types of breaches

24 Our Lambos might be parked in our parent’s garage, though.

Internal data and System data are 
usually byproducts of an extensive 
breach with multiple steps, as 
information from emails and documents 
are vacuumed up by threat actors. 
Credentials have really gained ground 
over the past five years, as the Use of 
stolen credentials became the most 
popular entry point for breaches. 

Of course, we still get specific data 
being beset, such as Medical, Bank 
account information and Payment card 
data. Those could be specific, targeted 
events or just be a part of the data that 
is acquired during a ransomware attack 
with data exfiltration. And just in case 
you are not tired of us moaning about 
ransomware,25 please enjoy Figure 22, 
where we can see another impact of the 
ransomware growth as the Obscuration 
of data became the most common 
availability impact variety, handily 
overcoming plain old Loss of data.

or exchanges being breached via 
their applications and application 
programming interfaces (APIs), or 
phishing and pretexting activity on chat 
platforms (like Discord) of the coin 
communities, where after a simple click 
on a link, suddenly your wallet is not 
yours anymore.

Having assets in virtual currency is 
a risky endeavor at best, even when 
there are no bad actors involved in 
rug\-pulling.26 The added focus of threat 
actors on these types of assets doesn’t 
make the landscape any easier. Our 
parting message is that unless security 
is taken seriously in those cases, we, in 
fact, are not going to make it.

25 We’re not bitter; you’re bitter. 
26 That rug really tied the room together, man!

Incident

Incident 
Classification 
Patterns: 
Introduction

One of the greatest gifts that evolution has granted the human race is a pattern\-
seeking brain. Was that just some swaying foliage in the jungle, or is a striped tiger 
sneaking around to pounce on us? The fact that humans are still around tells us we 
got that question right more often than we didn’t. Thankfully, we can also use our 
pattern\-seeking superpowers to try to organize and make sense of all the different 
ways in which computers remind us they were a mistake.27

Our incident patterns are, in a nutshell, a way to cluster similar incidents into an 
easy\-to\-remember shorthand. As we mentioned before, incidents are characterized 
by the 4As of VERIS, and we can avoid a long descriptive paragraph every time by 
classifying our incidents in this way.28 Our eight patterns, and how they are defined, 
can be found in Table 1\.

This year, we are showcasing a 
detailed breakdown of ATT\&CK 
Techniques29 and Center for Internet 
Security (CIS) Critical Security 
Controls30 related to certain patterns, 
as those are the places that make 
sense so we don’t repeat ourselves 
throughout this report. We are proud 
of the ATT\&CK mappings release, as 
they represent the culmination of a 
multiyear collaboration with MITRE 
CTID in creating and maintaining

a working relationship between its 
standard and VERIS. You can read 
more about this in our Appendix B. 

So, enjoy the cognitive load we 
just removed from your (pattern\-
seeking) grey matter as we deep 
dive into specific results and 
detailed analysis for each pattern.

As we have in prior years, here we 
present our Incident Classification 
Patterns (patterns) and show how they 
fared year over year. Figure 25 shows 
the patterns over time for incidents, 
and you can see that Denial of Service 
is top of the heap, as it has been for 
several years. 

When you contrast this graphic with 
Figure 26, you can see how different 
the environment looks when we are 
focused on those incidents where 
there was confirmed data loss.

The System Intrusion pattern—with its 
more complex attacks—has been an 
overachiever and includes multistep 
attacks that feature ransomware. 
But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. 
Let’s move into the detailed pattern 
sections for the full story.

Basic Web 
Application 
Attacks

Denial of 
Service

Lost and 
Stolen Assets

Miscellaneous 
Errors

Privilege 
Misuse

Social 
Engineering

System 
Intrusion

Everything 
Else

These attacks are against a Web application, and after 
the initial compromise, they do not have a large number 
of additional Actions. It is the “get in, get the data and 
get out” pattern. 

These attacks are intended to compromise the availability 
of networks and systems. This includes both network and 
application layer attacks.

Incidents where an information asset went missing, 
whether through misplacement or malice, are grouped 
into this pattern.

Incidents where unintentional actions directly compromised 
a security attribute of an information asset fall into this 
pattern. This does not include lost devices, which are grouped 
with theft instead. 

These incidents are predominantly driven by unapproved 
or malicious use of legitimate privileges.

This attack involves the psychological compromise of a 
person that alters their behavior into taking an action or 
breaching confidentiality.

These are complex attacks that leverage malware and/or 
hacking to achieve their objectives, including deploying 
Ransomware.

This “pattern” isn’t really a pattern at all. Instead, it covers all 
incidents that don’t fit within the orderly confines of the other 
patterns. Like that container where you keep all the cables for 
electronics you don’t own anymore: Just in case.

Summary

Frequency

This pattern largely pertains to attacks 
perpetrated by more dedicated 
criminals who utilize their expertise in 
hacking and ready access to malware 
to breach and/or impact organizations 
of different sizes, frequently leveraging 
Ransomware as their means of getting 
a payday. 

What is the same?

Ransomware continues to dominate this 
pattern as attackers leverage a bevy of 
different techniques to compromise an 
organization.

Imagine strolling into your office one 
morning only to discover an alarming 
desktop image from some criminal 
group with a cringeworthy name 
requesting Bitcoin (BTC) in exchange 
for the return of all your data. Hopefully, 
being the avid DBIR reader you are, 
you would have recent and well\-tested 
backups to restore from. However, what 
if these criminals do not stop at only 
encrypting your data but also threaten 
to leak portions of your more sensitive 
information unless paid? Oftentimes 
it appears that no matter how fast 
our defenses and practices evolve, 
attackers adapt theirs just as quickly.

This creates a perpetual arms race, 
and nowhere is it better represented 
than in the System Intrusion pattern. 

We frequently think of the threat 
actors in this pattern as the “hands 
on keyboard” type of attackers. While 
they might leverage automation to gain 
a foothold, once they are inside the 
organization, they utilize finely honed 
skills to bypass controls and achieve 
their goals. As Figure 28 illustrates, 
this commonly includes Ransomware. 
They use a variety of tools to traverse 
your environment and then pivot, 
including using phishing and stolen 
credentials to obtain access and adding 
backdoors to maintain that access 
and leverage vulnerabilities to move 
laterally. We can see these attacks 
more clearly when we break them 
into three smaller, more consumable 
portions. Namely, the initial access 
phase, the breach escalation and the 
results. Figure 27 has a breakdown of 
the Action\-Asset combinations that we 
see during different steps of the attack.

Figure 27\. Steps in System Intrusion breaches

Jiggling locks

When looking at Figure 27, we 
see the clear leaders for the initial 
access—a great deal of hacking 
servers and an almost equal amount 
of unknown actions. In terms of 
hacking, 9% of incidents involve 
Exploiting vulnerabilities and 8% 
involve the Use of stolen credentials. 
When we examine only our incidents 
that contain the exploitation of 
vulnerabilities, we find those 
vulnerabilities are largely exploited 
via Web applications (Figure 29\). 

Figure 28\. Action varieties in System 
Intrusion incidents (n\=2,700\)

Figure 29\. Action vectors in System 
Intrusion incidents (n\=787\)

2023 DBIR Incident Classification Patterns

25

In addition, we see some User devices 
being directly targeted, and we also 
observe Phishing in roughly 6% of 
cases. Phishing provides just another 
means of ingress, either to get a set 
of usable credentials or to deploy a 
payload on a user system. Malware is 
largely distributed via email and often 
comes in the form of Microsoft Office 
documents (see Figure 30\). This makes 
sense when you consider that most of 
these documents now have the ability 
to run code on the client system, which 
is extremely useful if you’re an attacker. 

Admittedly, there are many cases 
in which we do not know the exact 
means of entry the attacker used. 
However, these pathways of Exploiting 
vulnerabilities, Using stolen credentials 
and Phishing are very similar to 
previous years’ findings, and let’s face 
it, they are straight out of InfoSec 
101\. This again demonstrates the 
importance of the fundamentals.

Well, that 
escalated 
quickly.

Once attackers have access to your 
environment, they will typically look for 
ways to escalate privileges, maintain 
persistence and locate paths to move 
across the organization to achieve 
their ultimate goal, whatever that may 
be. For those ATT\&CK aficionados 
out there, you may be thinking this 

Figure 30\. Malware delivery method proportion per organization

2023 DBIR Incident Classification Patterns

26

sounds like we’re talking about a big 
chunk of that matrix. Well, we are. 
While we have a higher view of the 
incidents, we do not always have 
the telemetry required to find out 
exactly what techniques were used. 
However, below we discuss some of 
the additional hacking techniques and 
malware capabilities that we can track. 

Malware that maintains command and 
control (C2\) access to the system was 
witnessed in about 5% of incidents. 
Also present are the more typical types 
of malware that profile hosts, scan 
networks and (a local favorite) dump 
passwords. Lastly, just in case you 
thought the 2010s were behind us, we 
even found a handful of crypto miners 
in this dataset. There were not enough 
for us to confirm that they are back en 
vogue, but definitely enough to confirm 
that certain parties still consider 
compromised servers as free real\-
estate from which to mine.

Results

With such a high reliance upon 
the installation of malware across 
this pattern (either in the form of 
Ransomware, backdoors or payment 
card skimming malware) we shouldn’t 
be too surprised when we find servers 
that have illicit software installed as 
the most common combination of 
Attribute and Asset. The second most 
common is the exfiltration of data, 
and rounding out the trio is the loss 
of availability, aka rendering your data 
unreadable. These top three describe 
the final steps associated with many 
of these attacks quite well—attackers 
find a way to install their payload across 
the organization, steal data and then 
encrypt the systems on their way out. 

Ransomware … 
seriously, we’re 
still doing this 
section? 

Ransomware continues to be a major 
threat for organizations of all sizes 
and industries and is present in 24% 
of breaches. Of those cases, 94% 
fall within System Intrusion. While 
Ransomware has increased only 
slightly this year, it is so ubiquitous that 
it may simply be a threat that we will 
always have to protect against—91% 
of our industries have Ransomware 
as one of their top three actions. 

Figure 31\. Action vectors for 
Ransomware (n\=690\)

To understand how these attacks 
occur, it is often useful to look at the 
top Vectors for the actions. In this 
case, the most common ways in are 
Email, Desktop sharing software and 
Web applications (Figure 31\). Email 
as a vector isn’t going away any time 
soon. The convenience of sending 
your malware and having the user 
run it for you makes this technique 
timeless. The next most common 
vector, Desktop sharing software, 
makes sense, since these breaches 
and incidents frequently leverage 
some means of accessing a system. 
What better way to do that than by 
using a built\-in tool such as RDP or 
a third\-party version to provide the 
criminal mastermind a nice GUI?

Splitting 
the Log4j

As we DBIR authors groggily awoke 
from our hyperbolic slumber to start 
collecting and writing about all the 
major happenings in the cybersecurity 
world, we saw yet another major 
cybersecurity event had slowly 
played out after the cutoff of our data 
collection. This occurred first in 2020, 
with SolarWinds,31 and history has 
repeated itself in 2021 with Log4j,32 
opening what seems to be a Pandora’s 
box of vulnerabilities. However, there 
is one advantage to waiting—we get to 
watch as the dust settles and provide 
an objective analysis as to what 
actually occurred. There was a great 
deal of uncertainty and complexity 
surrounding the incidents involving the 
Log4j vulnerability. One of which was 
the fact that no one really understood 
the full scope of the breach as it was 
not simply in one software product 
but was actually in a library used by 
numerous applications and programs 
(both purchased and open sourced.) 

A quick recap of the event is perhaps 
warranted to refresh everyone’s 
memory. The vulnerability was 
disclosed in late November 2021, and 
within a few days the first exploitations 
began to appear. The vulnerability, 
given the designation of CVE\-2021\-
44228, was given a whopping 
criticality score of 10\.33 By the end of 
December, 0\.003% of the scanning 
activity captured by honeypots were 
actively poking and prodding for this 
specific vulnerability. While that number 
might seem small, the velocity was 
rather striking, with more than 32% 
of all Log4j scanning activity over the 
course of the year happening within 30 
days of its release (the biggest spike 
of activity occurred within 17 days, 

Figure 32\. Percentage of Log4j scanning for 2022

as Figure 32 shows). This velocity 
is an interesting comparison versus 
organizations’ median time to patch, 
which is currently 49 days for critical 
vulnerabilities, a number that has stayed 
relatively consistent over the years. 

However, it may not have been as 
big of a disaster as many predicted. 
When examining the DBIR incident 
dataset, we actually saw a decrease 
of vulnerability exploitation leading 
to incidents and breaches, with 
Log4j being mentioned in 0\.4% of 
our incidents (just under a hundred 
cases). However, when examining these 
cases, we found that Log4j was used 
by a variety of actors to achieve an 
assortment of different objectives, with 
73% of our cases involving Espionage 
and 26% involving Organized crime. 
Given the nature of the vulnerability, 
allowing remote code execution, 
we predictably saw a lot of malware 
activity associated with it, such as 
Backdoors and Downloaders to pull 
in additional hosts. Finally, in about 
26% of the cases, we saw the exploit 
of Log4j being leveraged as part of 
Ransomware attacks, which only goes 
to show that attackers will leverage 
whatever beachhead they can get. 

Based on some of the vulnerability 
scanning data we analyzed (as in the 
good folks scanning for vulnerabilities, 
not the bad ones) we found that 
vulnerable Log4j showed up in 8% of 
organizations. And in other somewhat 
surprising news, we also found that 
there was a greater percentage of 
Log4j installations that were end of 
life (EOL) with 14% of organizations, 
even if they weren’t actually vulnerable 
to Log4j explicitly. Lastly, 22% of 
the organizations had multiple (i.e., 
more than one) instances of the 
Log4j vulnerability in their systems. 

This underlying vulnerability in a 
dependency has brought back the 
discussion around having a software 
bill of materials (SBOM). You may 
think that SBOM is a term kids are 
throwing around in between their “no 
caps” and “bussin,” but its goal is to 
help organizations understand all 
the ingredients (software packages 
and libraries) that go into making the 
software their organization relies upon. 
Having a mature SBOM process across 
their ecosystem enables organizations 
to quickly identify vulnerabilities 
within the underlying libraries 
and help with future remediation 
processes for something like Log4j.

Just one more 
(Ransomware) note

Figure 33\. 95% and 80% confidence intervals of Ransomware incident cost 
per complaint (n\=2,575\)

Since we are hot on the subject 
of ransomware, we thought it 
would be interesting to revisit the 
breach impact data provided by 
our partner, the FBI Internet Crime 
Complaint Center (IC3\).34

When we last reviewed this data in 
the 2021 DBIR, we found that 90% 
of the incidents reported to the IC3 
had no financial loss result, but for the 
remaining 10%, the median amount lost 
was $11,500, and the range of losses 
in 95% of the cases were between $70 
and $1\.2 million. 

In reviewing Figure 33, of the incidents 
with loss, the calculated median 
more than doubled to $26,000, and 
the 95% range of losses expanded 
to sit between $1 and $2\.25 million, 
putting that upper bound in scarier 
territory if you are a small business. 
The FBI did find that only 7% of 
the incidents had losses in this 
case, so it’s not all bad news.

Now, before any one of you makes a 
snarky quip about inflation and the base 
rate of the economy, here is the unusual 
part: When combining the paid\-out 
transactions to the threat actors on 
the same time period, we get a much 
smaller median—$10,000 (Figure 34\), 
and this median is actually less than 
the two previous years when the DBIR 
team has had access to this dataset.

What this suggests is that the overall 
costs of recovering from a ransomware 
incident are increasing35 even as the 
ransom amounts are lower. This fact 
could be suggesting that the overall 
company size of ransomware victims 
is trending down. Even though the 
amounts requested by the threat 
actors would be smaller for those 
smaller companies—they want to get 
any money they can—the added costs 
of recovering their IT infrastructure 
under a backdrop of likely technical 
debt would spike their overall losses.

This is conjecture, as we don’t have 
the company size data and not all 
complaints have the associated 
transaction value data in this specific 
dataset. Even so, this is a result we 
have been expecting to see due to the 
increase of automation and efficiency of 
ransomware operators. Regardless, it’s 
fair to say that an ounce of prevention 
is worth a pound of cure,36 so we 
cannot emphasize enough the need of 
having a plan and/or incident response 
resources at the ready ahead of your 
next unscheduled encryption event.

Social 
Engineering

Summary

Frequency

Social Engineering incidents have 
increased from the previous year 
largely due to the use of Pretexting, 
which is commonly used in BEC, almost 
doubling since last year. Compounding 
the frequency of these attacks, the 
median amount stolen from these 
attacks has also increased over the 
last couple of years to $50,000\.

What is the same?

Phishing and Pretexting continue 
to dominate this pattern, thus 
ensuring that email remains one 
of the most common means 
of influencing individuals.

Professional 
engineers?

Engineering is a beautiful combination 
of math and physics applied to a 
practical and meaningful end—or 
so we’re told. However, much to our 
parents’ disappointment, most of 
us are not engineers, but only an 
infinite collection of monkeys tied to 
typewriters. (Legend has it we will 
compose “Hamlet” by pure chance any 
day now. Watch your back, GPT\-4\.)

However, this section is about another, 
not\-so\-useful\-to\-society, form of 
engineer—the social engineer. This 
pattern focuses on tactics used 
by threat actors that leverage our 
innate helpful nature to manipulate 
and victimize us. These attackers 
use a combination of strategies to 
accomplish this: by creating a false 
sense of urgency for us to provide a 
reply or to perform an action, a fake 
petition from authority, or even hijacking 
existing communication threads to 
convince us to disclose sensitive data 
or take some other action on their 
behalf. Social engineering has come 
a long way from your basic Nigerian 
Prince scam to tactics that are much 
more difficult to detect. This increased 
sophistication explains why Social 
Engineering continues to rise and 
currently resides in our top three 
patterns (accounting for 17% of our 
Breaches and 10% of Incidents).

There is a common misconception 
when it comes to distinguishing 
phishing from the more complex forms 
of social engineering. Raise your hand 
if you haven’t received an email with 
a dubious attachment or a malicious 
link requesting that you update your 
password. Nobody? Yeah, that’s what 
we thought. This is phishing, and it 
makes up 44% of Social Engineering 
incidents. Now, who has received an 
email or a direct message on social 
media from a friend or family member 
who desperately needs money? 
Probably fewer of you. This is social 
engineering (pretexting specifically) and 
it takes more skill. The most convincing 
social engineers can get into your head 
and convince you that someone you 
love is in danger. They use information 
they have learned about you and your 
loved ones to trick you into believing 
the message is truly from someone 
you know, and they use this invented 
scenario to play on your emotions and 
create a sense of urgency. Figure 35 
shows that Pretexting is now more 
prevalent than Phishing in Social 
Engineering incidents. However, 
when we look at confirmed breaches, 
Phishing is still on top.

One of the more complex social 
attacks is the BEC. In these pretexting 
attacks, actors leverage existing email 
threads and context to request that the 
recipient conduct a relatively routine 
task, such as updating a vendor’s bank 
account. However, the devil is in the 
details, and the new bank account 
belongs to the attacker, so all payments 
the victim makes to that account will 
make zero dents in what they owe 
that vendor. These types of attacks 
are often much harder to detect due 
to the groundwork laid by the threat 

actors prior to the attack. For example, 
they might have spun up a look\-alike 
domain that closely resembles that 
of the requesting party and possibly 
even updated the signature block to 
include their number instead of the 
vendor they’re pretending to represent. 
These are just two of the numerous 
subtle changes that attackers can 
make in order to trick their marks—
especially those who are constantly 
bombarded with similar legitimate 
requests. Perhaps this is one of the 
reasons BEC attacks have almost 
doubled across our entire incident 
dataset, as can be seen in Figure 36, 
and now represent more than 50% 
of incidents within this pattern.

Attack type doesn’t appear to have 
much of an effect on click/open rate. 
The median fail rates for attachment 
and link campaigns are 4% and 4\.7% 
respectively, and the median click 
rate for data entry campaigns is 5\.8% 
(though the data entry rate is 1\.6%).

Inconspicuous 
beginnings 

Because this pattern is largely based 
on human\-targeted attacks, it makes 
sense that the very first action in this 
pattern will be some form of phishing 
or pretexting email (Figure 37\). In fact, 
email alone makes up 98% of the vector 
for these incidents, with the occasional 
sprinkling of other communication 
methods, such as phone, social media 
or some internal messaging app that 
some folks might be Slacking off on 
(cough, cough). 

Two paths 
diverged, 
etc., etc.

What happens after that initial email 
is where things often diverge. There 
are two major routes that the attacks 
typically take. Most commonly, if the 
attackers are soliciting credentials and 
obtain them, then they will leverage 
those credentials to access the user’s 
inbox (found in 32% of incidents). 
The road less traveled is where—by 
simply using email communication—

the attackers are able to spin a 
credible story (albeit fictitious) to 
convince someone to do their bidding. 
Persuading someone to change the 
bank account for the claimed recipient, 
for example, is found in 56% of 
incidents. Of course, a combination of 
tactics can also be used. The attackers 
may leverage their acquired access to 
a user’s inbox to look for an email chain 
they can hijack or search the victim’s 
address book to find people who can 
be targeted further. It’s not uncommon 
for attackers to add forwarding rules 
to make sure their activities stay 
undetected as long as possible, which 
is why …

Time is of 
the essence.

When responding to social engineering 
attacks (and the same could be said 
of most attacks), rapid detection and 
response is key. The importance of 
timely detection is highlighted by the 
increasing median cost of BECs, as 
shown in Figure 38, which has risen 
steadily from 2018 and now hovers 
around the $50,000 mark. However, 
unlike the times we live in, this section 
isn’t all doom and gloom. Fortunately 
for the victims, law enforcement has 
developed a process by which they 
collaborate with banks to help recover 
money stolen from attacks such 
as BEC. More than 50% of victims 
were able to recover at least 82% of 
their stolen money. This illustrates 
the importance of ensuring that 
their employees feel comfortable 
reporting potential incidents to 
security, since their willingness to do 
so greatly improves the organization’s 
ability to respond. With this in mind, 
we encourage companies to step 
away from the “phishing exercises 
will continue until click rates 
improve” stance and adopt a more 
collaborative approach to security.

BECs (n\=73,420\). Based on FBI IC3

CIS 
Controls for 
consideration

There are a fair number of controls to 
consider when confronting this complex 
threat, and all of them have pros and 
cons. Due to the strong human element 
associated with this pattern, many of 
the controls pertain to helping users 
detect and report attacks as well as 
protecting their user accounts in the 
event that they fall victim to a phishing 
lure. Lastly, due to the importance of 
the role played by law enforcement in 
responding to BECs, it is key to have 
plans and contacts already in place. 

Why do BECs work?

Much like Ransomware, 
which is the monetization of 
access to an organization’s 
network, BECs are just one 
of the many means criminals 
have of monetizing access to 
a user’s inbox and contacts. 

• BECs can be targeted 
internally, meaning that 
the attacker will leverage a 
compromised employee’s 
email account to target 
their own organization by 
impersonating the user. We 
commonly see actors trying 
to redirect payroll deposits 
into an account they control.

• Alternatively, actors can target 
partners by using access to 
an employee’s email account, 
so they can impersonate that 
user and request updates to 
payments in order to include 
their own bank account.

While representing approximately one\-

Who dunnit?

While it may liven up our humdrum 
existence to imagine the threat actors 
behind breaches as characters from a 
game of Clue (the cyber version),37 it 
is more likely to have been an average 
Jane Doe using stolen credentials or 
some well\-known vulnerability.

This pattern, which accounts for 25% 
of our breaches, consists largely 
of leveraging stolen credentials 
and vulnerabilities to get access to 
an organizations’ assets. With this 
beachhead, the attackers can then do 
a variety of things, such as stealing 
key information hiding in emails or 
taking code from repositories. While 
these attacks aren’t complicated, 
they certainly are effective and have 
remained a relatively stable part of our 
dataset, which prompts us to discuss 
once again (drum roll, please), the 
importance of multifactor authentication 
(MFA) and patch management!38

Initial access

86% of the breaches, as you can 
see in Figure 39, involve the Use of 
stolen credentials. And where better 
to use those credentials than against 
the various web servers that contain 
our sensitive information? The other 
major part of the puzzle within this 
pattern is the use of exploits. This 
is where attackers have an exploit 
and the victims just happen to have a 
vulnerability (handy for the criminal). 
This typically occurs in only about 
10% of the dataset, and while that 
may sound like an insignificant 
number of breaches, unpatched 
vulnerabilities are still the bread and 
butter for many attackers, with 50% 
of organizations experiencing over 39 
Web application attacks this year.39

Breach 
escalation

Even though we refer to these attacks 
as “basic,” they’re not simply “one and 
done” incidents where credentials are 
leveraged against a web application and 
the attacker then goes on their merry 
way. There is often some sort of middle 
step (Figure 40\). For instance, malware 
is frequently one of the primary means 
of maintaining persistence (look at 
us, using them fancy ATT\&CK terms), 
with Backdoor or C2 in about 2% 
of the incidents. In other cases, the 
attackers will leverage their current 
access to conduct additional attacks. 

Figure 39\. Top Action varieties for 
Basic Web Application Attacks 
breaches (n\=1,287\)

39 One of the advantages to running these types of attacks is that the server never tires, never sleeps, 
it just throws exploits at everyone continually, night and day—unlike your humble cybersecurity 
analyst who needs at least four coffees a day and nine hours of sleep.

Impacts

With regard to impact, we commonly 
see that after Web applications, Mail 
servers are one of the preferred 
targets for attackers. This makes 
sense, because hidden away in our 
inboxes among the hundreds of unread 
emails40 there are often key internal 
documents (41% of breaches involve 
mail servers) or, sadly, credentials to 
some other system. The findings for 
this pattern show that attackers can 
access Internal data (41%), Medical 
data (6%) and even Banking data 
(6%) using simple inbox mining tactics 
(again, reminding us of the importance 
of good email and server hygiene).

You can’t eat 
just one.

One thing you probably don’t hear 
often is someone saying, “If I only 
had more usernames and passwords 
to remember.” Credentials are as 
ubiquitous as sand in the desert and 
almost as hard to hold onto. Threat 
actors seem to have a plentiful supply 
as well. However, what is missing in our 
data, and we try to be explicit when it 
comes to biases and limitations, is that 
we don’t necessarily know where all 
these credentials are coming from. But 
we here on the DBIR team love a good 
mystery. Did the butler do it? Are aliens 
real? What about the Yeti? Ghosts? 
People with strong work ethics? Alas, 
we will probably never know. We may 
also never know where the criminals 
obtained the credentials in the first 

place. We might have a good idea in 
terms of the different ways that one 
would be capable of getting credentials, 
such as buying them from password 
stealers who are nabbing them through 
social engineering or even spraying 
them in a brute force attack. What we 
don’t have is the exact breakdown 
of how many of our breaches and 
incidents are caused by each. As the 
old adage goes “What we know is a 
drop; what we don’t know is an ocean.”

It’s not all bad news, however. Even 
though there are many ways to steal 
credentials, we have many ways to 
protect them as well. One of the 
best ways (stop me if you have heard 
this one before) is the use of MFA. 
Before you recline in your chair and 
“Well, ACKtually …” us, we do realize 
there are limitations to some MFA 
implementations. As you’re undoubtably 
aware, some very high profile breaches 

this year demonstrated some of those 
shortcomings. In some cases, criminals 
used social engineering to convince 
users to accept the authentication 
attempts. In other instances, they 
stole the session cookie and used it 
to masquerade as the user. Of course, 
some MFA bypasses weren’t really 
bypassing MFA because some of the 
services weren’t properly configured to 
ONLY use MFA. As mentioned above, 
what we can’t really tell you at this time 
is how much there were of each, as 
we need to both update our standard 
VERIS and collect the data. While this 
would be an awesome opportunity 
for us to finally settle the score and 
discuss which MFA is better and which 
bypasses are leveraged the most, we 
will have to keep this placeholder for 
another year. 

Quote from 
Jen Easterly
Director 
U.S. Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security 
Agency

As the Nation’s Cyber Defense Agency, 
the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA) sees how our 
nation’s adversaries operate and what 
tools they use. While some of these 
adversaries use advanced tools and 
techniques, most take advantage of 
unpatched vulnerabilities, poor cyber 
hygiene or the failure of organizations 
to implement critical technologies like 
MFA. Sadly, too few organizations 
learn how valuable MFA is until they 
experience a breach.

Since joining CISA, I’ve made it a 
priority to raise MFA awareness across 
all sectors to better protect our nation’s 
critical infrastructure. Importantly, 
we need more and better data to 
understand the scope of, and solutions 
to, the threats we face in cyber, and 

we’ve called on our industry partners 
to provide radical transparency to allow 
our defenders to better see, understand 
and ultimately protect our citizens, 
customers and companies. In particular, 
it’s critical that “high\-value targets” like 
system administrators and Software 
as a Service (SaaS) staff use phishing\-
resistant MFA.

But more and better information is 
just the beginning.

Working collaboratively, I look 
forward to seeing what we can 
do to together to make our nation 
more resilient, more secure, and 
to show measurable progress … 
including in next year’s Verizon Data 
Breach Investigations Report.

If you happen to be interested 
in how we updated VERIS to 
capture attacks that bypass 
MFA, look no further than the 
list below:

1\. Added a new Action to indicate 
the take\-over of a secondary 
authentication mechanism 
(hijack)

2\. Added a new data variety—
Multifactor credential—to 
indicate whether the other 
factors, aside from credentials, 
were captured 

3\. Added the social variety 
of Prompt Bombing41 
for those attacks that 
target sending annoying 
levels of authentication 
requests to users

Hopefully, the combination of 
our existing enumerations, along 
with these new ones, will capture 
the majority of the cases we 
encounter. If not, we will re\-
examine our enumerations with 
the next version of VERIS.

You can’t find 
good help 
these days.

The great English poet and essayist, 
Alexander Pope once quipped, “It is 
hard to hire people who don’t screw 
things up.” Well, it was something 
more or less along those lines—just 
take our word for it. Regardless of 
who said (or did not say) what, the 
Miscellaneous Errors pattern continues 
to comprise a decent chunk of our 
breach data. If you are a “glass half full” 
kind of reader, you may take comfort 
in the fact that this year, error\-related 
breaches are down to 9% as opposed 
to 13% last year. If you are a “glass 
half empty” reader, you may simply 
attribute it to reporting since last 
year we had 715 error incidents and 
708 with confirmed data disclosure 
as opposed to 602 incidents, with 
512 confirmed breaches this year. 

It’s my favorite 
mistake.

Perhaps “favorite” is too strong a word. 
Misdelivery (sending something to the 
wrong recipient) accounts for 43% of 
breach\-related errors in our dataset 
(Figure 41\). Publishing errors (showing 
something to the wrong audience) 
is in second place at 23%. Finally, 
Misconfiguration, the much\-loved 
action type of the lazy person, comes 
in third and accounts for 21% of error\-
related breaches. This might tempt us 
to think that people are unreliable—
perish the thought. However, you can 
rely on them to at least keep things 
interesting by switching up their 
mistakes to help keep you on your toes. 

2023 DBIR Incident Classification Patterns

40

In fact, as Figure 41 illustrates, 
Misconfiguration and Misdelivery 
have ebbed and flowed over the 
last few years as if they were part 
of the choreographed dance of 
celestial bodies. In last year’s report, 
Misdelivery and Misconfiguration 
converged, but this year Misdelivery 
is in the ascendancy,42 whereas our 
old faithful dog, the Publishing error, is 
once again meeting Misconfiguration 
on its downward slope. 

If we drill down a little deeper (Figure 
42\), it’s easy to see that these 
three Error types have won the 
popularity contest by a wide margin. 
However, the team is saddened to 
see that Gaffe is always at or near 
the bottom (considering how many 
of those we make ourselves). 

As illustrated in Figure 43, the majority 
of errors that lead to breaches are 
committed by Developers and System 
admins, along with a sprinkling of End\-

are most often found in breaches, it is 
hardly surprising that those who have 
more responsibility for maintaining the

are also those who are most frequently 
responsible. Speaking of responsibility, 
the error vector of Carelessness 
appeared in 98% of cases. Yikes!

As Denial of Service continues to 
dominate our incidents, so do the 
capabilities of mitigation services. 
However, there has been a resurgence 
of low volume attacks that still cause 
issues to corporations.

What is the same?

Denial of Service attacks continue to be 
ubiquitous and have remained in the top 
spot of incidents for several years now.

Figure 44\. Patterns over time in incidents

We will not 
be denied.

As the name would imply, the Denial 
of Service pattern covers all of 
those attacks that try to keep you 
from streaming your next episode 
of “Below Deck,” watching your next 
TikTok movie or loading your timeline 
on Twitter.43 Sadly, all of this can 
obviously add up to the nuisance of 
having to acknowledge the real world 
and the people around us. We can all 
agree that would be terrible indeed.

However, as some of our readers may 
know, organizations still actually need 
the internet to be up and running in 
order to conduct business. Every year, 
DoS shows up as a huge volume of 
Incidents in our datasets, stemming 
from several different mitigation service 
partners, including Verizon’s own. 
They are all doing an excellent job in 
preventing those Incidents from having 
any significant impact on organizations. 
In that light, even though the Denial of 
Service pattern has consistently taken 
the top spot in Incidents for the last 
several years (Figure 44\), there is really 
not a lot of nuance to be discussed 
here, apart from our usual suggestion 
to invest in some sort of mitigation 
service if you care about the continued 
availability of your network presence on 

43 Not sure if we can blame our usual threat actors for this one.

42

the internet. This is not due to a lack of 
nuance in the DDoS dataset overall but 
more a reflection of a lack of the typical 
details that we traditionally analyze 
such as Actors, Assets and Attributes.

Even so, it didn’t feel right to deny our 
readers a Denial of Service section, 
as there are still important trends 
and information that are necessary 
to be reviewed. It’s important to 
realize they’re still there, even if you 
can easily solve them. Also, it is a 
respite to not have to write about 
Ransomware for a couple of pages.

We are going 
to need a 
bigger pipe.

One important point we should touch 
on is the growth of median and above 
median percentiles in bits per second 
of DDoS attacks (see Figure 45\).44 The 
median grew a whopping 57%45 from 
1\.4 gigabytes per second (Gbps) last 
year to 2\.2 Gbps now, and the 97\.5 
percentile grew 25% from 99 Gbps 
to 124 Gbps. This is to be expected 

Figure 45\. Bits per second in DDoS incidents (n\=10,622\)

as costs of bandwidth and CPU 
processing become more accessible 
and available and suggests a trend 
that is hard to break on escalating 
competition between the attackers 
and mitigating services. Just make 
sure your contracted service can clear 
that bar, and most of the impact will 
likely be absorbed. Let the machines 
fight it out Transformers\-style and 
crack open a cold beverage while 
you worry about all the other attack 
patterns afflicting your corporation.

Even as the volume of garbage in our 
networks grows, some attacks have a 
more subtle touch. A point of attention 
that some of our partners brought 
to us was the growth of distributed 
DNS Water Torture46 attacks in, you 
guessed it, shared DNS infrastructure. 
It is basically a resource exhaustion 
attack done by querying random name 
prefixes on the DNS cache server so 
it always misses and forwards it to the 
authoritative server. It is quite silly when 
you think of it, but it can be a heavy 
burden with some simple coordination 
by the threat actors’\-controlled 
devices. Make sure to check on your 
DNS infrastructure resiliency and 
check for options with your mitigation 
service as well to make sure you are 
protected against these attacks too.

44 Be sure to discuss this at parties. You’ll be wildly popular. 
45 I bet you thought our inflation numbers in the U.S. were bad, huh? 
46 This is NOT a subtle name!

Lost and 
Stolen Assets

Summary

Frequency

This pattern continues to be a problem 
for organizations because these 
small (and not so small) devices are 
just so portable. We’ve seen their 
capacity to store large amounts 
of data increase over time, while 
employees’ ability to misplace them 
(or External actors to steal them) 
remains predictably common.

Devices and media are still more likely 
to be lost by Internal actors than stolen 
by External ones.

Where go 
my laptop?

The headline in this pattern is “Your 
stuff is gone,” which isn’t really a news 
flash. Whether the missing item(s) 
had “help” in the form of someone 
stealing a laptop, or was accidental, 
as in classified printed documents 
being mislaid in high\-level government 
officials’ residences, the more portable 
an asset is, the more it needs protection 
against loss and theft.

This is a pattern where we see a high 
percentage of incidents not resulting 
in confirmed data breaches—largely 
because the status of confidentiality 
disclosure remains “at\-risk” rather 
than “confirmed” due to the loss of 
custody of the asset in question. The 
exception is printed material, since no 
controls exist to shield documents from 
view once printed. Similar to last year, 
we again have less than 10% of the 
incidents as confirmed data breaches.

While stolen devices certainly represent 
a risk to organizations, employees are 
much more likely to cause a breach 
accidentally through loss. This fact 
has held true year over year on a 
consistent basis, as shown in Figure 46\.

What is going missing, you may ask? 
Unsurprisingly, it’s the portable user 
devices, such as laptops, and mobile 
phones. In fact, phones have become 
quite the commodity (Figure 47\). 
Considering the fact that no one 
ever seems to put them down, it’s 
hard to believe so many are lost.

Data 
compromised

My employees 
love me!

People may think they are somehow 
immune to a data breach. They 
may put their trust in their security 
controls, thinking they have amazing, 
impenetrable defenses. They may put 
their trust in “flying under the radar” 
or believe they are too small to have a 
breach. But this kind of thinking largely 
assumes breaches come from the 
outside, from the “bad actors” that are 
external to the organization. What they 
fail to take into account is the risk of 
an insider breach. “Surely, MY people 
wouldn’t do that!” they say. But of 
course, they would—and don’t call 
me Shirley. 

The hard fact to face is that some of our 
employees also cause data breaches 
for malicious reasons. The most 
common nonaccidental Internal actor 
breach is Privilege abuse. This is just 
what it sounds like—employees abusing 
the access they have been given to 
do their jobs to steal data instead. 
They are significantly more likely to 
do this for their own financial gain 
(Figure 48\). We know, it’s a shocker.

Figure 48\. Internal actor motives in 
Privilege Misuse breaches (n\=59\)

2023 DBIR Incident Classification Patterns

46

We are increasingly seeing Privilege 
Misuse breaches paired with Fraudulent 
transactions, more so this year than in 
the past several, as shown in Figure 49\. 
Fraudulent transactions are an Integrity 
violation that is frequently the end game 
of the BEC and is typically a money 
transfer to a threat actor\-controlled 
bank account. However, since Internal 
actors already have access to the 
systems where bank accounts and 
routing information are stored in these 
cases, they’re probably just making 
that banking update themselves. 
Seeing Internal actors increasingly just 
redirect funds is especially concerning, 
considering it may be someone 
in a position to siphon significant 
resources away from the organization.

We’ll just help 
ourselves.

We’ve talked about your employees 
committing these acts—but our At\-
a\-Glance table shows that we see 
other kinds of threat actors in this 
pattern. Interestingly, we see multiple 
threat actors (Internal, External, 
Partner—some combination of these 
three) in 7% of the breaches. This 
is collusion—evidence of multiple 
kinds of Actors working together 
to bring about a data breach. 

Indeed, we have seen instances where 
organized fraud gangs have sent in 
people with the objective of being 
hired by businesses for the purpose of 
facilitating large\-scale scams. We have 
seen this in multiple industries, and it 
has continued to plague organizations 
for years. These people can be 
difficult to spot—they may present and 
interview convincingly. This practice by 
financially motivated criminal groups 
makes it even more important to have 
your detective controls in place to 
catch the inappropriate access that 
these people are enabling. One of 
the difficulties in responding to an 
incident like this is that no company’s 
onboarding process is perfect, and 
most onboarding involves getting the 
new hire added to various groups and 
systems that aren’t always directly 
controlled by IT. Those investigations 
often reveal process\-related 
weaknesses in the IT infrastructure.

Industries

Industries: 
Introduction

If you are a new reader, you may find this introduction of some use. If, on the other 
hand, you are a long\-time reader, then just move along; this will all be familiar territory. 
The 2023 DBIR examined 16,312 incidents, of which 5,199 were confirmed data 
breaches. We take a look at both from the point of view of their respective industries 
in the upcoming sections. Attacks that consistently prey on one industry may not 
affect another industry at all. Attack surfaces, the interest of specific threat actors and 
the infrastructure a given industry relies upon all play a big role in how they experience 
security incidents. The types and quantity of data the industry handles, how people 
(customers, employees, etc.) interact with them, and a host of other factors too 
numerous to mention will also dictate the kinds of attacks each industry encounters. 

A large organization whose business model focuses entirely on mobile devices and 
the apps it includes will naturally have a different set of risks than a very, very small 
business with no internet presence but that uses a point\-of\-sale (PoS) vendor to 
manage their systems for them. The infrastructure, and conversely the attack surface, 
largely drives the risk. 

Therefore, we caution our readers not to make inferences about the security posture 
(or lack thereof) of a particular sector47 based on how many breaches or incidents 
an industry reports. These numbers are heavily influenced by several factors, 
including data breach reporting laws and partner visibility. Because of this, some of 
the industries have very low numbers, and as with any small sample, we must advise 
readers that our confidence in any statistics derived from a small number must also 
be less. 

If you are reading this only for a glimpse of your industry, our recommendation is to 
verify what the top patterns are on the summary table accompanying each industry 
and also spend some time with those pattern sections.

47 Legal made us say that; of course, you should totally ridicule your \[fren]emies in other industries.

I’ll just scrape 
that off.

System Intrusion is the top pattern in 
this sector for the second year running. 
Included in this pattern, among other 
things, is a collection of various types 
of malware. Approximately one\-third of 
cases involved the use of Ransomware, 
and much of the remainder consisted 
of RAM scrapers. In fact, RAM scrapers 
targeting the PoS is the favorite combo 
in this sector, which likely comes as no 
surprise to those trying to maintain 
their defenses.

Payment card data was targeted 
41% of the time, which is the same 
percentage we saw last year, but since 
Credentials and Personal data fell as 
a proportion of the whole, they have 
taken a back seat to credit cards. 
Along with the increased focus on the 
data type of Payment cards comes the 
motivation of Financial. Last year, we 
saw the Espionage motive in 9% of the 
breaches, but this year, it is all Financial 
all the time.48

Give a person 
a phish and you 
feed them for 
a day!

Social continues to have a considerable 
presence in this sector. While Phishing 
and Pretexting (the main difference 
between them is how hard the adversary 
must work to make it happen) are the 
main social engineering concerns in 
Accommodation, they are too close 
to call for the top spot. Most of these 
social attacks are coming in via email, so 
make sure it is easy for your employees 
to report any questionable attempt 
quickly. There is nothing like having your 
employees be your first line of defense—
they are certainly already on the front line 
of targets.

that regularly plague this sector.

Hacking was present in 40% of 
breaches, with the Use of stolen 
credentials appearing in 31% of 
them. Not to be outdone, Malware 
also showed up in 40% of breaches, 
with Ransomware present in 30% 
of those breaches. Let’s review that 
finding for the exam: Ransomware was 
responsible for almost one\-third of all 
breaches in the Educational Services 
vertical. In spite of this impressive 
showing from both Hacking and 
Malware, the System Intrusion pattern, 
while maintaining its number one spot, 
decreased slightly from last year.

Who saw 
that coming?

In a move that shocked faculty, staff and 
students alike, last year’s much lauded 
salutatorian, Basic Web Application 
Attacks, has dropped out (of the top 
three patterns). Miscellaneous Errors 
is still present (isn’t it always?) and has 
increased slightly from last year. As you 
may have guessed, these errors are the 
usual suspects: Misdelivery, Publishing 
errors and Misconfiguration. 

Social Engineering clawed its way to 
the number three position, increasing 
from 14% last year to 21% in 2023 
(Figure 52\). This rise is primarily 
represented by Phishing attacks, 
which showed up in 18% of breaches, 
and Pretexting scenarios (4%).

Basic Web Application Attacks dropped 
out of the top three to be replaced 
by Social Engineering. Ransomware 
continues to play a large role in 
breaches in this vertical.

These attacks 
are so basic.

Make them 
work for it.

Rounding out the top three is the pattern 
that requires adversaries to actually put 
forth a bit of effort, System Intrusion. 
While it dropped from 27% to 14% this 
year (allowing Miscellaneous Errors to 
dominate), it remains a serious issue. 
This illustrates that at least some of 
the time, adversaries had to trot out 
their more sophisticated techniques in 
order to get the job done. Interestingly, 
Ransomware is decreasing as a favorite 
tactic in this pattern for this sector. We 
discuss it more in depth in the “Incident 
Classification Patterns” section in case if 
you skipped that part. We know, some of 
you just read the DBIR for the pictures.

“We were compromised by a highly 
sophisticated cyberattack.” So reads 
a large percentage of data breach 
notification letters. But really, just how 
sophisticated is a brute\-forced password? 
Or better still, credential stuffing where 
you don’t even have to guess the 
password—you’ve acquired it from 
another breach! The Basic Web 
Application Attacks pattern is the most 
prevalent in this sector, which means 
those not\-so\-complex attacks are 
succeeding splendidly for the adversaries. 
Why put forth a great deal of effort when 
just a little will do?

Wait—did I give 
you that?

Another prominent attack involves 
Internal actors making mistakes. 
Misdelivery—where protected data is 
sent to the wrong recipient—is the most 
common. Sometimes it is a matter of 
paper documents going to the wrong 
people, and other times it is just the 
electronic version that goes astray. 
Either way, extra care needs to be 
given to catching these kinds of Errors 
before they cause a data breach.

fraud, continues to be

Summary
With Basic Web Application Attacks as 
the top pattern, we know that the 
adversaries are successfully gaining 
access without too much effort. This, 
combined with the Misdelivery error, 
indicates there is room for good 
controls to cover a decent percentage 
of attacks in this sector.

Summary
Ransomware actors continue targeting 
this sector and are increasingly causing 
confirmed data breaches in the process. 
Errors (particularly Misdelivery) are 
prevalent as well. Finally, don’t discount 
the insider threat in this industry.

A sector 
under siege

The Healthcare vertical is highly 
targeted by ransomware gangs, which 
results in both the loss of use of 
their systems—potentially with life\-
threatening consequences—as well as 
data breaches. While the number of 
ransomware incidents peaked in this 
industry in 2021, the last three years 
have seen a jump in data breaches 
(where the data is confirmed to have 
been stolen as well as the encryption 
triggered) caused by ransomware. This 
combination of attacks by adversaries 
is resulting in more data being 
compromised in addition to the usual 
chaos of staff being forced to do their 
jobs without the systems they rely upon.

Mitigating these attacks takes time—if 
the organization even has reliable, 
tested backups of the systems 
compromised—and resources. If 
both are scarce in your organization, 
prevention and early detection are your 
best friends. Don’t ignore the threat this 
type of attack represents when you are 
planning your controls.

Sorry ’bout 
that

The Miscellaneous Errors pattern 
remains prevalent in healthcare. The 
action variety of Misdelivery is a 
consistent people problem. This is the 
mistake that happens when data that 
is supposed to go to a certain person 
(or group) actually ends up going to 
someone entirely different. Sometimes 
it is in the form of that spreadsheet with 

sensitive employee health information 
accidentally being sent to a much wider 
distribution than planned (those email 
groups can be so similar—thanks a lot, 
autocomplete). In other cases, it is a 
mailing error with paper documents 
that are placed in such a way that 
too much information is visible in the 
envelope’s clear window. Who wants 
their letter carriers to know about their 
embarrassing condition? Customers 
(patients) are understandably upset.

Where’s my 
gruntle?

Ah, the disgruntled employee—so often 
the perpetrator of malicious actions 
and wreaking the kind of havoc only an 
insider can achieve. While the Privilege 
Misuse pattern is no longer in the top 
three for this industry, it remains a 
consistent problem. Snooping from 
curiosity—more the bored employee 
than the actively hostile—is common 
in Healthcare as well. But this is also 
a sector in which we see evidence 
of collusion, multiple actors working 
together to make their breach dreams 
a reality. If only this diligence could 
be put toward their legitimate work 
tasks, these employees could be top 
performers. The industry’s only defense 
for when someone loses their gruntle is 
fast detection of unusual data access 
patterns. This remains a challenge for 
any industry where internal actors are 
motivated to cause trouble.

Summary
Miscellaneous Errors continues the 
downward trend it has exhibited for the 
last several years and loses its position 
in the top three to Social Engineering. 
Denial of Service attacks account for 
70% of incidents in NAICS 51\.

Make no 
mistake, 
information 
is power.

Over the last few years, errors have 
played a diminishing role in breaches 
within the Information vertical. That 
downward trend continues this 
year, so much so that it has fallen to 
number four and accounts for only 
13% of breaches (Figure 53\). Good 
on ya, Information folks! Securing 
your assets from the bad guys is 
hard enough without unwittingly 
exposing assets yourself.

Social Engineering, on the other hand, 
has slowly crept up and captured the 
number three position with 20% of 
breaches. In some industries, we see 
a much higher degree of Phishing than 
we do of its more complicated cousin, 
Pretexting. In the Information vertical, 
however, the two social actions are 
not far apart, with Phishing at 15% 
and Pretexting at 11%. As mentioned 
elsewhere in this report, Pretexting is 
definitely on the rise. 

Please listen 
closely as our 
options have 
NOT changed.

As always, external actors (the vast 
majority of which are Organized crime) 
are behind most attacks in this vertical. 
In fact, last year, we showed only 
External and Internal actors. This year 
we did see an increase (albeit very 
small) in the categories of Partner and 
multiple actors at 1% each. Granted, 

Figure 53\. Patterns in Information 
sector breaches (n\=384\)

those are not big numbers, but it is of 
interest to see them reappearing in this 
industry for the first time in a couple 
of years. As one would expect, the 
vast majority of attacks, regardless 
of who was committing them, were 
Financially motivated. The motive of 
Espionage was still present at 8% of 
breaches but is significantly lower than 
last year’s 20%. The most likely reason 
for the change is the move away from 
web apps and servers and toward spy 
balloons and remote viewing.

As Figure 56 illustrates, when we drill 
down into what attack actions most 
often occur in the Manufacturing 
vertical, we see that Hacking and 
Malware attacks are occurring at 
almost exactly the same rate and 
that Social attacks continue to make 
a strong showing. Ransomware, 
which accounts for a large part of 
the breaches in the System Intrusion 
pattern, continues to slowly trend 
upward in this vertical for the third year 
in a row (Figure 55\).

In our postmodern world, we rely on 
gadgets and gizmos galore to make it 
through our day—certainly more so than 
at any other time period in history.49 
The importance of Manufacturing 
truly cannot be understated as it 
relates to how we exist and interact 
with each other on a daily basis. The 
Manufacturing industry is aware of this 
and consequently is continually looking 
for the next big thing that we all think 
we can’t live without. Cybercriminals 
know it as well and are constantly 
maneuvering in an effort to cash in.

This year we can see in Figure 54 the 
same top three patterns that we saw 
in last year’s report, albeit in a slightly 
different order. Social Engineering 
(23%) and Basic Web Application 
Attacks (17%) changed places in the 
lineup, while System Intrusion remains 
in first place at 42%.

Figure 56\. Select Actions over time in 
Manufacturing breaches

From an incident perspective, it is still 
mainly about Denial of Service attacks. 
DoS attacks account for approximately 
67% of incidents in this vertical. This 
has been a rising trend over the past 
few years, so if your organization 
resides in this industry, it is definitely 
something to keep an eye on.

Summary
Hacking and Malware actions are 
pacing each other in the race for the 
top two spots. While Social Engineering 
attacks are still alive and well, they 
are a distant third. For incidents, do 
not discount Denial of Service attacks 
against this industry’s infrastructure to 
disrupt the ability to meet deadlines.

Summary
Ransomware is responsible for 
approximately one out of three 
breaches in this vertical. Social 
Engineering, in spite of its overall 
rise, has decreased in this industry.

Dig around and 
find out.

Due to the smaller number of incidents 
and breaches reported to us from 
NAICS 21 and 22, we have to dig deep 
(pun intended) at times to have a 
statistically relevant population. Even 
so, because of the smaller sample 
size, we are sometimes still forced 
to use ranges rather than definite 
percentages. However, as both these 
sections are considered critical 
infrastructure and are not too dissimilar, 
we do our best to find useful and 
interesting nuggets where we can. Are 
you a member of these industries? If 
so, please consider becoming a DBIR 
contributor to help us provide more 
useful analysis.

The number one pattern this year is 
System Intrusion. If you have been 
reading the other sections, you will 
know that this in no way makes those 
in this vertical the Lone Ranger. As 
stated in the patterns section, the 
System Intrusion pattern is made up 
of more complex, multistep attacks as 
opposed to the “get in, grab the loot 
and scram” type of attacks. Specifically, 
most ransomware attacks fall into 
System Intrusion, and approximately 
one out of three breaches (32%) in 
this industry were ransomware attacks 
(Figure 57\). Given the high rate of 
success of ransomware (along with 
the fact that attackers often take data 
before they encrypt it, and they do love 
to post it on their leak sites), seeing 
so much of it in critical infrastructure 
verticals is a matter for concern.

Last year we commented on the high 
number of breaches in this vertical that 
fell into the Social Engineering pattern. 
This year it has dropped out of the 
top three completely with Basic Web 
Application Attacks and Miscellaneous 
Errors coming in at numbers two 
and three. In fact, Social Engineering 
dropped out of the top five. This is 
mildly surprising due to the uptick we 
are seeing in phishing and pretexting in 
other industries. Maybe the criminals 
don’t want to have to actually interact 
with others to steal money? We 
can certainly understand that.

When it comes to what the threat actors 
are taking, personal data accounts 
for half, and there was a substantial 
rise in Internal data (33% this year as 
opposed to 9% last year, as shown in 
in Figure 58\). This may be tied to the 
name and shame ransomware attacks 
mentioned on the previous page.

This sector could perhaps be 
considered the lubricant that keeps all 
industries running smoothly. It consists 
of many disparate professions, 
including our lawyer friends \[joke 
redacted by legal], accounting and 
various other business services. Much 
like the other sectors they serve, this 
industry is also affected by the big three 
patterns of System Intrusion (47%), 
Basic Web Application Attacks (25%) 
and Social Engineering (18%).

With regard to action varieties, while we 
see DoS and Use of stolen creds 
among the top actions in Figure 59, we 
also see a good deal of Ransomware. 
This year, Ransomware accounted for 
approximately 23% of the incidents in 
this sector, which is a notable increase 
from last year’s 14%. 

If you are wondering how these 
breaches occur, you need look 
no further than Web applications 
(55%), Email (25%) and Desktop 
sharing software (17%). Considering 
the frequent usage of stolen 
credentials and email, it might be 
a good time to remind folks to 
implement strong authentication 
practices and to encourage your 
team members to keep in mind the 
importance of staying diligent.

incidents following the same core 
vectors as the previous year.

What’s worse 
than quiet 
quitting?

This brings us to the point that internal 
actor Misuse continues to be a 
consistent problem in this sector. While 
prevalent, it is not increasing, so that 
is at least some good news. In fact, 
Misuse peaked in 2019 (of the past five 
years) and has decreased somewhat 
since then. However, the pairing of the 
unhappy employee with a motivated 
external adversary shows the continued 
need for detective controls. If you 
can catch this kind of Internal actor\-
facilitated attack in its early stages, you 
can mitigate the damage significantly.

We see evidence of collusion 
(multiple actors working in 
concert) in 16% of Public 
Administration breaches this 
year. That is significant, given 
that we didn’t see multiple Actor 
breaches the past two years in 
this sector, and in 2020’s report, 
it was only at 2%.

This sector continues 
to be targeted by 
Financially motivated 
external threat 
actors as well as 
spying Nation\-states 
that are interested 
in what their rivals 
are doing. Personal 
data remains the 
most often stolen 
data type.

Summary
This sector continues to make top 
scores in Espionage\-motivated 
breaches. It is also rich in multiple actor 
breaches. External and Partner or 
Internal actors working together to 
steal data is not the kind of international 
cooperation we want to see fostered.

That’s no 
moon!

Whether data is stolen by stealthy 
“weather research” balloons (death 
stars) floating overhead or by more 
conventional methods such as phishing, 
external threat actors are diligently 
gaining access to data in the public 
sector. Mind you, when we created 
VERIS to allow us to categorize 
breaches, we didn’t expect to see it 
applied to UFOs being shot out of the 
sky. But, until it becomes a trend, we 
will simply tag it as Physical \- Other and 
call it a day for now.

The System Intrusion pattern remains 
high in this sector. Some intrusions are 
stuff that movies are made of—complex 
attacks against a challenging target, 
where the stakes are high for entire 
economic systems.50 We did see an 
increase in the Espionage\-motivated 
actors in this pattern this year. In fact, 
this sector is one where the Espionage\-
motivated actor is consistently among 
the highest.

Within the System Intrusion pattern, we 
saw a slight decrease in Ransomware 
as a tactic. This doesn’t mean you 
should ignore it, however, as it remains 
a favored method of disrupting 
government workings while generating 
income for the adversaries.

While it is possible to reach their goals 
by themselves, these actors are not 
opposed to recruiting help from within 
the organization. We see evidence of 
collusion (multiple actors working in 
concert) in 16% of Public Administration 
breaches this year. That is significant, 
given that we didn’t see multiple Actor 
breaches the past two years in this 
sector, and in 2020’s report, it was 
only at 2%.

50 There are explosions and car chases in there too, we’re sure of it.

If you are in the Retail world and you 
operate an e\-commerce platform, 
then this section is especially worth 
paying attention to. Within Retail, 
we often find the “Magecart”51\-type 
actors. These criminals find ways of 
embedding their malicious code within 
your site’s credit card processing page. 
This allows them to quietly and subtly 
abscond with your customers’ payment 
data without actually affecting the 
functionality of your website. Currently, 
these attacks represent about 18% 
of Retail breaches. While we freely 
admit that we don’t always know how 
these Actors were able to access the 
web application and upload their bad 
JavaScript, we have seen them use 
several different tricks (Figure 61\).

While the same three patterns dominate

has the added bonus of being targeted 
for its Payment card data in addition 
to common threats like Ransomware 
and Basic Web Application Attacks.

Can you breach 
me now?

Some people turn to the Retail sector 
as a form of therapy—and we on 
the DBIR team probably have more 
dragons, guitars and cuckoo clocks 
(don’t ask) than we really need. Sadly, 
criminals have been enjoying their 
own “retail therapy” by targeting this 
sector for many years. They continue 
to do so by capitalizing on this 
industry’s heavy use of payment data.

Top actions/
top vectors

When it comes down to how these 
breaches and incidents occur, it is a 
roundup of the usual suspects, with 
both Ransomware and Use of stolen 
credentials among the top, along with 
Email and Web applications for vector. 
However, there is a relatively unique 
addition to some of these actions—the 
“Export data” and “Capture app data.” 
This is also one of the few industries 
where we see “Other” creep up as 
one of the top actions (Figure 60\), and 
that’s largely because there’s a variety 
of secondary actions that actors are 
using to either deploy their ransomware 
or find a way to collect payment cards.

Considering the function of this 
industry, it is hardly surprising to see 
Payment card data as one of the 
most common data types breached, 
accounting for 37% of breaches this 
year. If you look at Figure 62, you can 
readily observe that Payment card data 
has been trending downward since its 
high\-water mark in 2018\. However, we 
are seeing a relatively large increase in 
Payment card data stolen as compared 
to last year. Although stealing card 
data is a tried\-and\-true method of 
monetizing data, sometimes the threat 
actor simply wants a quicker payday. 
Ransomware has definitely skewed 
some of the data in this sector, but it 
seems as if Payment card data is still 
extremely valuable and will continue to 
remain a popular target.

This begs the question: Where is this 
data being stolen from? Because it’s 
difficult to protect something if you 
don’t know what you are protecting. 
Luckily, we have some data that may 
help. In our analysis of just payment 
card breaches in Retail, we found that 
70% of breaches originated from Web 
applications, 17% from Gas terminals 
and 8% from PoS servers. This once 
again illustrates how e\-commerce has 
made it way too easy to get what you 
want, including stolen credit cards. 
If you are looking for some added 
incentive, it’s worth mentioning that by 
the time our 2024 DBIR is published, 
you should all already be compliant

Small and 
medium business

“ Let’s do 
some word 
problems!”
— said no one ever (except 

math teachers)

In certain prior reports, we have 
compared and contrasted small 
and medium businesses (SMBs) 
against large organizations to 
determine whether the attack surface 
differed significantly between them. 
Increasingly, both SMBs and large 
companies are using similar services 
and infrastructure, and that means 
that their attack surfaces share more 
in common than ever before. This 
has led to a convergence of attack 
profiles regardless of the size of the 
organization. However, what is very 
different is the ability of organizations to 
respond to threats due to the number of 
resources they can deploy in the event 
that they are attacked.

The tables on the right illustrate the fact 
that SMBs and large organizations have 
increasingly become similar to each 
other. This phenomenon began several 
years ago, and by now there is so little 
difference based on organizational 
size that we were hard\-pressed to 
make any distinctions whatsoever. 
Therefore, this year we decided to 
look at these a bit differently53 by 
looking at the implementation of 
security controls for various size 
SMBs (smaller, midsize and larger) 
and how they may overlap or differ.

In past reports we have discussed the 
research we conduct with regard to 
controls—in particular, the work we 
have done with MITRE to map VERIS 
to ATT\&CK. This year, we would like 
to take this research a bit more into 
the real world and apply it to how you 
would use these mappings with the 
appropriate CIS Implementation Group 
protective controls.

When you drill further into the Sub\-
Controls, more granularity should guide 
you in your quest for maturing your 
organization’s security posture. Each 
organization will need to customize 
and prioritize according to its own risk 
profile and tolerance, but it is at least 
a place to begin. Once the most likely 
suspects are accounted for, move onto 
the next mostly likely attack pattern 
you may be facing and determine 
how to handle that. Using data\-driven 
information on your most probable risk 
areas is a defensible strategy toward 
prioritizing controls with few resources. 
Hopefully after some progress is made, 
your Jack\-/Jill\-of\-all\-trades can go back 
to sleeping at night.

It’s not easy 
being small.

Let’s assume you’re a startup—a tiny 
company in its infancy. You have very, 
very limited resources for implementing 
security controls of any kind. Your IT 
person is also your security person is 
also your Jack\- (or Jill\-) of\-all\-trades 
who wears many hats and never sleeps.

The first step is to see which controls 
are recommended for your level of 
security maturity and resources. But 
where to begin? We like the CIS Critical 
Security Controls Navigator as a good 
starting point.54 It breaks down each 
of the CIS Controls into small, easy\-
to\-consume chunks and then maps 
them to various security standards that 

Control

Description

an organization may want to comply 
with as their adopted standard. You 
will see that they are broken into three 
Implementation Groups, and each one 
is geared to the organization’s maturity 
level. Since we’re at the beginning here, 
we will start with Implementation Group 
1 (IG1\). While these are all good controls 
and should be on the road map, let’s 
take a more threat\-centric approach in 
our scenario.

You can see in Tables 3 and 4 that 
regardless of an organization’s size, 
they are most commonly going to 
face the System Intrusion pattern. 
In last year’s report, we mapped 
the Controls to the pattern and 
showed which were most commonly 
going to help you in an attack.55 
The result in IG1 shows Controls 14 
(89%), 11 (80%) and then 5 (67%).

Security Awareness and Skills Training
Establish and maintain a security awareness program to 
influence behavior among the workforce to be security 
conscious and properly skilled to reduce cybersecurity 
risks to the enterprise.

Data Recovery
Establish and maintain data recovery practices sufficient to 
restore in\-scope enterprise assets to a preincident and 
trusted state.

Access Control Management
Use processes and tools to create, assign, manage 
and revoke access credentials and privileges for user, 
administrator and service accounts for enterprise assets 
and software.

Midsize is 
the right size.

You’ve been at this a while. You’re 
not tiny, but you’re not quite at the 
enterprise level just yet. You have been 
working diligently at maturing your 
processes in both IT operations and 
in information security. You have put 
in place the Controls in IG1 and are 
now eyeing IG2 to take your company 
to the next level of protection.

With that in mind, let’s take a look at 
the IG2 controls that cover the Social 
Engineering pattern, which is the 
second largest threat for SMBs. The 
first two controls are the same main 
categories as they were for System 
Intrusion, Control 5 (100%) and 
Control 14 (100%). However, the third 
control is different for this pattern:

• Control 17 – Incident Response 

Management 
Establish a program to develop 
and maintain an incident response 
capability (e.g., policies, plans, 
procedures, defined roles, training and 
communications) to prepare, detect 
and quickly respond to an attack.

An Incident Response Management 
plan is key to all areas of security but 
perhaps especially so when it comes 
to Social Engineering attacks for a few 
reasons. Many of these attacks, such 
as pretexting, tend to escalate quickly 
and can have a high impact. Perhaps 
just as importantly, employees need to 
feel secure in the knowledge that they 
have a place they can report these 
incidents to when they occur because 
the sooner they report them, the more 
quickly you can address them.

“ You get a 
resource! 
You get a 
resource! 
Everybody 
gets a 
resource!”

Now let’s pivot to look at the larger 
organizations in the SMB area. To 
clarify, we are still writing with regard 
to SMBs, we simply mean the larger 
companies that still fall into that 
category (\<1,000 employees). When 
your company reaches this point, there 
are more resources available to throw 
at problems, whether in the form of 
more people, more technology options 
or just plain more cash,56 and bringing 
those resources to bear can yield 
substantial benefits. At this, level you 
may have tackled IG1 and IG2 and are 
ready for IG3 Controls.

These Controls mature along with 
your organization. Therefore, let us 
examine the IG3 Controls with regard 
to the third most common pattern 
for SMB: Basic Web Application 
Attacks. The first, Control 17 (100%), 
we talked about in the previous 
section, but Controls 16 (100%) and 
18 (100%) we have not yet discussed.

• Control 16 – Application 

Software Security 
Manage the security life cycle 
of in\-house developed, hosted 
or acquired software to prevent, 
detect and remediate security 
weaknesses before they can 
impact the enterprise.

• Control 18 – Penetration Testing 

Test the effectiveness and 
resiliency of enterprise assets 
through identifying and exploiting 
weaknesses in controls (people, 
processes and technology), and 
simulating the objectives and 
actions of an attacker.

Control 16 is certainly timely, 
considering the SolarWinds case from 
last year’s report and the Log4j impact 
discussed in this year’s report, so we 
should have no problem seeing the 
relevance of this Control. Sub\-Controls 
16\.2: Establish and Maintain a Process 
to Accept and Address Software 
Vulnerabilities, 16\.4: Establish and 
Manage an Inventory of Third\-Party 
Software Components, and 16\.5: Use 
Up\-to\-Date and Trusted Third\-Party 
Software Components would have 
gone a long way to defending against 
both of those cases.

56 And this never really hurts, does it?

2023 DBIR Small and medium business

67

Once an entity has reached the larger 
end of the SMB scale, Control 18 
also comes into play. Establishing 
penetration testing capabilities and 
incorporating their findings into the 
security processes can only improve 
the information security posture of a 
larger SMB. This is basically real\-world 
testing of your controls to make sure 
they are performing how you expect 
them to. Like backups, only controls 
that have been tested and verified 
should be trusted.

Now that you’ve already looked at the 
Controls and prioritized them, you 
know what you’re most likely to be 
hit with and you’re working your way 
through to the end—your ducks are 
almost all in a row. You have balanced 
preventive and detective capabilities 
and are on your way to being able to not 
only detect when something bad has 
happened but also respond quickly and 
appropriately. You have moved from the 
basics of putting your plan together to 
implementing a road map.

A few final things to consider at this 
point: Are you looking at aligning with 
a particular compliance framework? 
Do you track metrics around security 
in your environment? Do your efforts 
result in ongoing improvements to 
your security posture, or do they just 
provide a point\-in\-time snapshot that 
says, “I was good at this moment, 
but then things changed”? There 
is quite a bit you can do when you 
use good information about what 
is happening in your organization 
to steer your security strategy.

From the Center for Internet Security:

Report after report, and study 
after study, shows that many 
attacks are successful because 
network owners did not know their 
enterprise assets, the software 
they had running and where their 
critical data was. Knowing your 
environment is foundational to 
any cybersecurity program, so 
they encompass the first three 
controls of the CIS Critical 
Security Controls (Controls). 
After all, you can’t protect what 
you don’t know you have. 

After understanding your 
environment, you can prioritize 
where to apply and which 
controls to implement across your 
enterprise. At CIS we know that 
this will take time and resources, 
which is why we have prioritized 
the Controls and supporting 
Safeguards to help you plan your 
security improvement program. 
We do this through Implementation 
Groups (IGs). There are three IGs 
and are based on the risk profile 
and resources an enterprise has 
available to them to implement 
controls. Each IG builds upon the 
previous one. So IG2 builds upon 
IG1 and IG3 comprises all the 
Controls and Safeguards.

We describe a typical IG1 
enterprise as small to medium\-
sized with limited IT and 
cybersecurity expertise to dedicate 
toward protecting IT assets and 
personnel. The principal concern 

of this enterprise is to keep the 
business operational, as they have 
a limited tolerance for downtime. 
The sensitivity of the data that they 
are trying to protect is low and 
principally surrounds employee and 
financial information.

Safeguards selected for IG1 should 
be implementable with limited 
cybersecurity expertise and aimed 
to thwart general, non\-targeted 
attacks. These Safeguards will 
also typically be designed to work 
in conjunction with small or home 
office commercial off\-the\-shelf 
(COTS) hardware and software.

But no matter the size or 
complexity of your business, we 
recommend that all organizations 
begin with IG1\. We also refer to 
IG1 as Essential Cyber Hygiene 
because it provides the actions 
necessary for an organization 
to defend itself against the 
major attack types being used 
by cybercriminals. IG1 is not just 
another list of good things to 
do; it’s an essential set of steps 
that helps all enterprises defend 
against real\-world threats. And it 
provides a strong foundation for 
your cyber maturity growth, or as 
your security needs change. This 
is a strong claim, but we back it up 
with our use of the best\-available 
summaries of attacks (like the 
Verizon DBIR), and an open, shared 
methodology (the CIS Community 
Defense Model v2\.057\).

Regions

Regions: 
Introduction

This edition of the DBIR marks the fourth year we have examined cybercrime 
incidents from a macro\-regional point of view. We hope our readers find this 
broader look at cybercrime useful and instructive. As previously mentioned, 
our visibility into a certain region is determined by many variables, including 
contributors, regional disclosure laws and our own data. If your part of the world 
is not featured in the following pages, please contact us about becoming a data 
contributor and motivate other organizations in your area to do the same so that 
we can keep growing and improving our coverage each year. Even if your region is 
not represented here, this does not mean we have no visibility into the region but 
rather that we don’t have enough incidents in that geography to have a statistically 
significant section.

We define the regions of the world in accordance with the United Nations M4958 
standards, which combines the super\-region and sub\-region of a country together. 
By so doing, the regions we will examine are as follows: 

APAC: Asia Pacific, including Southern Asia (034\), South\-eastern Asia (035\), 
Central Asia (143\), Eastern Asia (030\) and Oceania (009\) 

EMEA: Europe, Middle East and Africa, including Northern Africa (015\), Europe 
(150\) and Eastern Europe (151\), and Western Asia (145\) 

LAC: Latin America and the Caribbean, 
including South America (005\), Central 
America (013\) and Caribbean (029\)

NA: Northern America (021\), including 
the United States and Canada 

As in previous years, we have sliced and 
diced our data in many ways, and this 
time we are presenting the data for the 
various regions a little differently. Long\- 
time readers will recognize the At\-
a\-Glance tables that we put in each 
major section, only in this case, we’ve 
combined them to give you an easy way 
to see just how similar (and different) 
each of the regions are with regard to 
the frequency, top patterns, etc.

It is readily apparent that the System 
Intrusion pattern is top of the heap for 
all regions except APAC, where it is still 
a large problem, just not as pressing 
as Social Engineering. It is also quite 
clear that the who and why behind 
cybercrime is the Financially motivated 
external actor. We see more variation in 
the data types favored by these actors 
in the different regions, and while our 
data frequently shows us the “what,” it 
rarely tells us the “why.” It may be that 
certain data types are better protected 
by regulatory requirements in certain 
regions versus others. It may be some 
other factor we haven’t thought of; it’s 
hard to say. But clearly, Credentials are 
still figuring prominently and need to 
be made less valuable when breached 
(hint: we’re looking at you, MFA).

Just feast your eyes on these lovely 
heatmaps in Figure 63\. This is our 
favorite way to illustrate how different 
(or similar) these attacks are based on 
geography. When broken out by pattern 
and region, you can clearly see that 
although there are definitely differences 
(many of which are no doubt based on 
industry and their resulting common 
infrastructure partners), there are 
some concentrations for each 
region as well as across regions.

Hopefully this is illustrative of what 
your region—and, when combined with 
other data in this report, industries 
and organization size—is most prone 
to in terms of attacks so that you can 
better direct your defensive strategy. 
If you’re still unsure where to start and 
you skipped over the SMB section, it is 
a good reference for how to apply the 
information in this report.

Year in review

January

February

March

The VTRAC Intelligence Analysts experienced déjà vu as we began 2022 tracking attacks exploiting 
Log4j in much the same way SolarWinds campaigns kicked off 2021\. During the first week of December 
2021, the Log4j vulnerability became the biggest blip on the InfoSec risk radar. About a week later, 
VMware observed Log4Shell attacks, and “the majority of the attacks target Linux systems.” Log4j, 
and especially attacks on VMware, remained a persistent risk issue through 2022\. Before the end of 
the month, Prophet Spider, a notorious initial access broker, was selling VMware Horizons systems 
breached using Log4j. The Russian Ember Bear threat actor (TA) launched attacks on Ukraine using 
WhisperGate wiper malware. Microsoft patched a zero\-day vulnerability in the Win32k.sys driver. Apple 
patched a zero\-day vulnerability impacting iPhones and iPads. 

Collection and analysis of intelligence covering cyberattacks supporting Russia’s February 2022 invasion 
of Ukraine was the most significant activity for VTRAC in February. On and before February 24, the 
Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)61 launched AcidRain wiper malware attacks on the Viasat 
satellite communications terminals in Ukraine, but significant collateral damage was also done to terminals 
scattered across Europe. Ukraine was targeted with at least six new wiper malwares by Russian TAs. 
On February 25, the notorious cybercrime\-as\-a\-service TA, “Conti” announced support for Russia. Two 
days later, Twitter user “@ContiLeaks” released 400 internal Conti files including 60,000 chat messages. 
“Ordinary” cyber intelligence in February included zero\-day vulnerabilities in Zimbra, Chrome, Apple OS 
and Adobe Commerce/Magento. Cybercriminals controlling Emotet leveraged the Russia\-Ukraine conflict 
in bait themes in their malspam. 

Zero\-day exploitation of vulnerabilities in Chrome, Firefox, Trend Micro Apex Central and Mitel business 
telephony components kept enterprise security and patch management teams busy in March. Increased 
vigilance looking for evidence of Russian\-Ukraine cyber\-attacks yielded intelligence on APT actors from 
China, Iran and North Korea. Chinese APT actor Mustang Panda used the Russia\-Ukraine conflict in 
attacks on diplomatic missions, think tanks and ISPs in Mongolia, Vietnam, Myanmar and Russia. New 
intelligence detailing the exploitation of a vulnerable web application led to lateral exploitation of networks 
in several US state governments by APT41 (Winnti), another Chinese APT actor. Iranian APT MuddyWater 
targeted the Arabian Peninsula, Turkey and Pakistan. The largest cryptocurrency theft to date occurred 
when North Korea’s Lazarus Group stole more than US$620 million from the Ronin Network. North 
Korean APT Kimsuky targeted a nuclear\-related think tank with their signature “BabyShark” malware. The 
Lapsus$ TA shifted tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) from ransomware to data theft extortion, 
claiming compromises at Microsoft, Okta, Nvidia and Samsung.

61 Now known as the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian 

Federation—how’s that for a mouthful?

April

May

June

Patch management teams were especially harried in April mitigating zero\-day vulnerabilities under 
attack in the Windows CLFS, Apple OS, Trend Micro security products, Chrome browser and VMware. 
Sophos firewalls came under attack hours after release of a security advisory and patches. SonicWall, 
Zyxel and FortiGuard also released security advisories and updates for their firewalls. The VTRAC 
began collecting more than the usual volume of intelligence on APT\-grade actors yielding TTP updates 
usable by both other TAs and Verizon Cyber Security Consulting clients. A campaign by the Chinese 
APT\-grade actor Deep Panda had been exploiting the ill\-famed Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware 
Horizon servers missing December’s patches. We also collected intelligence on Russian state actors 
attacking Ukraine, including details on the attack on Viasat in February, and four operations by North 
Korea’s Lazarus Group. Attacks by cybercrime TAs including LockBit, FIN7, ALPHV, Hive, CL0P and 
Conti continued unabated.

Vulnerabilities in infrastructure components began to emerge as a recurring theme in 2022\. In the 
wild exploitation commenced within one week of the release of security advisories and patches in 
vulnerabilities in F5 BIG\-IP appliances (CVE\-2022\-1388\) and Zyxel firewalls (CVE\-2022\-30525\). 
Microsoft patched 74 vulnerabilities in May’s Patch Tuesday, including a zero\-day Windows LSA Spoofing 
Vulnerability (CVE\-2022\-26925\). CISA initially added it to their Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog 
but quickly removed it to avoid outages caused by authentication failures resulting from precipitous 
domain controller patching. Two infamous malware families, Emotet and REvil, thought to have shut down, 
each made a resurgence in May, but the controversial ransomware group Conti disbanded. As May ended, 
intelligence emerged that a Chinese APT actor was exploiting another Windows zero\-day vulnerability 
(CVE\-2022\-30190\) to attack targets in Russia and Belarus. The “Folina” vulnerability was a remote code 
execution vulnerability in the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT). 

Days after the discovery of Folina, Atlassian announced patches for a zero\-day remote code 
execution vulnerability (CVE\-2022\-26134\) in Confluence Data Center and Server. Over the Memorial 
Day weekend in the United States, Volexity’s incident responders had detected suspicious activity 
on two internet\-facing Atlassian Confluence Servers with Behinder web shells installed, probably by 
Chinese threat actors. Volexity also reported that a zero\-day vulnerability in Sophos Firewall (CVE\-
2022\-1040\) was being exploited by a Chinese APT actor they labeled, “DriftingCloud.” Intelligence 
indicated that widespread attacks, by the infamous Chinese APT actor Deep Panda, were continuing 
to successfully exploit Log4j in unpatched VMware Horizon servers.

July

August

The release of cyber intelligence reports usually precedes the Black Hat USA and DEF CON conferences. 
The quality, quantity and breadth of those reports in 2022 represented the most significant intelligence 
for the month of July. Tracking successful TTPs has been an intelligence requirement because our 
adversaries are adept at learning from open source intelligence (OSINT), making agility in tuning security 
architecture an imperative. Exploitation of zero\-day vulnerabilities in Google’s Chrome browser and 
Windows CSRSS kept patch management teams busy, as did three unexploited critical vulnerabilities 
in multiple Atlassian products. Intelligence emerged that a ransomware and crypto mining TA had been 
successfully exploiting one, CVE\-2022\-26138, since June. 

In addition to “Folina” a second zero\-day remote code vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows Support 
Diagnostic Tool was discovered, exploited and patched in August. Apple, macOS, iOS and iPadOS 
plus Google Chrome all had their own zero\-day vulnerabilities reported and patched. In early August, 
current and former employees of Twilio received smishing messages purporting to be from Twilio’s IT 
department calling for a password change. That breach led to the compromise of 9,931 accounts in 
130\+ organizations, most of which used Okta identity and access management solutions. The threat 
actor compromised 93 users of Twilio’s Authy multifactor authentication solutions. Intelligence emerged 
attributing these and multiple identity attacks at least as far back as March to the “Scatter Swine” or 
Oktapus TA. 

September

September was the zero\-day\-palooza month for 2022\. Two days into the new month, Google Chrome 
and Microsoft Edge were patching a zero\-day vulnerability in their browsers. Trend Micro mitigated 
their second zero\-day vulnerability of the year following successful in\-the\-wild attacks on their Apex 
One security products. And Sophos firewall customers had to patch their second zero\-day of the 
year. The most significant zero\-days were attributed to a Chinese APT actor that chained a pair of 
Windows vulnerabilities quickly nicknamed “ProxyNotShell.” VMware servers were also targeted by 
a Chinese cyberespionage actor employing malicious vSphere installation bundles for ESXi, Linux 
and Windows servers. 

2023 DBIR Wrap\-up

76

October

Microsoft did not patch “ProxyNotShell” in October’s Patch Tuesday release, but they did release a patch 
for CVE\-2022\-41033, an elevation of privilege zero\-day. Fortinet patched a zero\-day authentication 
bypass vulnerability in multiple products. More than 1,600 servers were breached by exploiting a zero\-day 
in Zimbra Collaboration Suite, CVE\-2022\-41352, and tardy patching of three earlier Zimbra vulnerabilities. 
“Text4Shell” entered the InfoSec lexicon after a new Apache Commons Text library vulnerability, even 
though no attacks were reported. Two notorious malwares repurposed to expand their target sets: 
URSNIF and Emotet each exhibited significant TTP shifts, the former from banking Trojan to initial access 
downloader and the latter awoke from a four\-month siesta as the tool of a full\-service malware\-as\-a\-
service operator. Other zero\-day attacks, vulnerabilities and patches were reported in Chrome browser 
and, separately, iOS and iPadOS. 

November

Several strains of malware highlighted InfoSec risk intelligence in November. Forty days after the initial 
reports of ProxyNotShell attacks on Exchange, Microsoft patched those two vulnerabilities. Microsoft 
also patched four other zero\-days in its products on Patch Tuesday. Chrome browser also mitigated a 
zero\-day vulnerability. Updated intelligence on three malware families were prominent in the VTRAC 
collections. SocGholish is a JavaScript framework and malware\-as\-a\-service used by cybercriminals 
to implement drive\-by\-downloads. Bumblebee, a new malicious loader, first appeared in May and in 
November began delivering Meterpreter and Cobalt Strike payloads. Cybercriminals controlling the 
Raspberry Robin worm evolved into initial access brokers for deploying other payloads. 

December

Breaking the string of end\-of\-year InfoSec milestones set in 2020 with SolarWinds Orion and in 2021 
by Log4j, December 2022 was comparatively boring. Intelligence indicated several threat actors were 
abusing Microsoft developer accounts to get malicious drivers signed through their profiles to be used 
in cyberattacks, including ransomware incidents and SIM swapping operations. The streak of months 
with attacks exploiting zero\-day vulnerabilities was extended with reports of successful attacks on 
Microsoft, Apple, Fortinet and Citrix products. OWASSRF is a new attack chain exploiting on\-premises 
Exchange Servers using the URL rewrite mitigations provided by Microsoft responding to September’s 
ProxyNotShell attack chain. The Play ransomware threat actors had exploited OWASSRF to attack at 
least eight victims. Among the best intelligence collections was a virtual order of battle of TA subordinate 
to Bureau 121 in the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), North Korea’s military intelligence agency.

Appendices

Appendix A: 
Methodology

One of the things readers value most 
about this report is the level of rigor and 
integrity we employ when collecting, 
analyzing and presenting data. Knowing 
our readership cares about such 
things and consumes this information 
with a keen eye helps keep us honest. 
Detailing our methods is an important 
part of that honesty.

First, we make mistakes. A column 
transposed here; a number not updated 
there. We’re likely to discover a few 
things to fix. When we do, we’ll list them 
on our corrections page: verizon.com/
business/resources/reports/dbir/2023/
corrections/.

Second, we check our work. The same 
way the data behind the DBIR figures 
can be found in our GitHub repository,62 
as with last year, we’re also publishing 
our fact check report there as well. 
It’s highly technical, but for those 
interested, we’ve attempted to test 
every fact in the report. 

Third, science comes in two flavors: 
creative exploration and causal 
hypothesis testing. The DBIR is 
squarely in the former. While not 
perfect, we believe we provide the 
best obtainable version of the truth (to 
a given level of confidence and under 
the influence of biases acknowledged 
below). However, proving causality is 
best left to randomized control trials. 
The best we can do is correlation. And 
while correlation is not causation, they 
are often related to some extent and 
often useful. 

Non\-committal 
disclaimer

We must reiterate that we make no 
claim that the findings of this report are 
representative of all data breaches in all 
organizations at all times. Even though 
we believe the combined records from 
all our contributors more closely reflect 
reality than any of them in isolation, 
it is still a sample. And although we 
believe many of the findings presented 
in this report to be appropriate for 
generalization (and our conviction in 
this grows as we gather more data and 
compare it to that of others), bias exists. 

The DBIR 
process

Our overall process remains intact 
and largely unchanged from previous 
years.63 All incidents included in this 
report were reviewed and converted, if 
necessary, into the VERIS framework 
to create a common, anonymous 
aggregate dataset. If you are unfamiliar 
with the VERIS framework, it is short 
for Vocabulary for Event Recording 
and Incident Sharing. It is free to use, 
and links to VERIS resources are at the 
beginning of this report.

The collection method and conversion 
techniques differed between 
contributors. In general, three basic 
methods (expounded below) were used 
to accomplish this:

1\. Direct recording of paid external 

forensic investigations and related 
intelligence operations conducted by 
Verizon using the VERIS Webapp

2\. Direct recording by partners 

using VERIS

3\. Converting partners’ existing schema 

into VERIS

All contributors received instruction to 
omit any information that might identify 
organizations or individuals involved. 

Some source spreadsheets are 
converted to our standard spreadsheet 
formatted through automated mapping 
to ensure consistent conversion. 
Reviewed spreadsheets and VERIS 
Webapp JavaScript Object Notation 
(JSON) are ingested by an automated 
workflow that converts the incidents 
and breaches within into the VERIS 
JSON format as necessary, adds 
missing enumerations and then 
validates the record against business 
logic and the VERIS schema. The 
automated workflow subsets the data 
and analyzes the results. Based on 
the results of this exploratory analysis, 
the validation logs from the workflow 
and discussions with the partners 
providing the data, the data is cleaned 
and reanalyzed. This process runs 
nightly for roughly two months as data 
is collected and analyzed.

Incident data

Our data is non\-exclusively multinomial 
meaning a single feature, such as 
“Action,” can have multiple values (i.e., 
“Social,” “Malware” and “Hacking”). 
This means that percentages do 
not necessarily add up to 100%. 
For example, if there are five botnet 
breaches, the sample size is five. 
However, since each botnet used 
phishing, installed keyloggers and 
used stolen credentials, there would 
be five Social actions, five Hacking 
actions and five Malware actions, 
adding up to 300%. This is normal, 
expected and handled correctly 
in our analysis and tooling.

Another important point is that when 
looking at the findings, “unknown” is 
equivalent to “unmeasured.” Which is 
to say that if a record (or collection of 
records) contains elements that have 
been marked as “unknown” (whether it 
is something as basic as the number of 
records involved in the incident, or as 
complex as what specific capabilities a 
piece of malware contained), it means 
that we cannot make statements about 
that particular element as it stands 
in the record—we cannot measure 
where we have too little information. 
Because they are “unmeasured,” 
they are not counted in sample sizes. 
The enumeration “Other,” however, 
is counted as it means the value was 
known but not part of VERIS (or not one 
of the other bars if found in a bar chart). 

Finally, “Not Applicable,” (normally 
“NA”), may be counted or not counted 
depending on the claim being analyzed.

This year we have made liberal use 
of confidence intervals to allow us to 
analyze smaller sample sizes. We have 
adopted a few rules to help minimize 
bias in reading such data. Here we 
define “small sample” as less than 
30 samples.

1\. Sample sizes smaller than five are too 

small to analyze.

2\. We won’t talk about count or 

percentage for small samples. 
This goes for figures, too, and is 
why some figures lack the dot 
for the median frequency.

3\. For small samples we may talk about 
the value being in some range or 
values being greater/less than each 
other. These all follow the confidence 
interval approaches listed above.

Incident 
eligibility

For a potential entry to be eligible 
for the incident/breach corpus, a 
couple of requirements must be 
met. The entry must be a confirmed 
security incident defined as a 
loss of confidentiality, integrity or 
availability. In addition to meeting 
the baseline definition of “security 

incident,” the entry is assessed 
for quality. We create a subset of 
incidents (more on subsets later) that 
pass our quality filter. The details 
of what is a “quality” incident are:

• The incident must have at least seven 

enumerations (e.g., threat actor 
variety, threat action category, variety 
of integrity loss, et al.) across 34 fields 
OR be a DDoS attack. Exceptions are 
given to confirmed data breaches with 
less than seven enumerations.

• The incident must have at least one 
known VERIS threat action category 
(hacking, malware, etc.).

In addition to having the level of details 
necessary to pass the quality filter, the 
incident must be within the timeframe of 
analysis, (November 1, 2021, to October 
31, 2022, for this report). The 2022 
caseload is the primary analytical focus 
of the report, but the entire range of 
data is referenced throughout, notably 
in trending graphs. We also exclude 
incidents and breaches affecting 
individuals that cannot be tied to an 
organizational attribute loss. If your 
friend’s laptop was hit with Trickbot, it 
would not be included in this report.

Lastly, for something to be eligible 
for inclusion into the DBIR, we have 
to know about it, which brings us 
to several potential biases we will 
discuss below.

2023 DBIR Appendices

Acknowledgement and 
analysis of bias

Many breaches go unreported (though 
our sample does contain many of 
those). Many more are as yet unknown 
by the victim (and thereby unknown to 
us). Therefore, until we (or someone) 

can conduct an exhaustive census of 
every breach that happens in the entire 
world each year (our study population), 
we must use sampling. Unfortunately, 
this process introduces bias. 

Breaches

per Action

Figure 65\. Individual contributors

Figure 66\. Individual contributors 
per Asset

Figure 67\. Individual contributors 
per Attribute

The first type of bias is random 
bias introduced by sampling. This 
year, our maximum confidence is 
\+/\- 0\.7% for incidents and \+/\- 1\.4% 
for breaches, which is related to our 
sample size. Any subset with a smaller 
sample size is going to have a wider 
confidence margin. We’ve expressed 
this confidence in the complementary 
cumulative density (slanted) bar charts, 
hypothetical outcome plot (spaghetti) 
line charts and quantile dot plots.

The second source of bias is sampling 
bias. We strive for “the best obtainable 
version of the truth” by collecting 
breaches from a wide variety of 
contributors. Still, it is clear that we 
conduct biased sampling. For instance, 
some breaches, such as those publicly 
disclosed, are more likely to enter our 
corpus, while others, such as classified 
breaches, are less likely.

The four figures on the left are an 
attempt to visualize potential sampling 
bias. Each radial axis is a VERIS 
enumeration, and we have stacked 
bar charts representing our data 
contributors. Ideally, we want the 
distribution of sources to be roughly 
equal on the stacked bar charts along 
all axes. Axes only represented by 
a single source are more likely to be 
biased. However, contributions are 
inherently thick tailed, with a few 
contributors providing a lot of data 
and a lot of contributors providing a 
few records within a certain area. Still, 
we mostly see that most axes have 
multiple large contributors with small 
contributors adding appreciably to the 
total incidents along those axes.

2023 DBIR Appendices

81

You’ll notice rather large contributions 
on many of the axes. While we’d 
generally be concerned about this, they 
represent contributions aggregating 
several other sources, not actual single 
contributions. It also occurs along most 
axes, limiting the bias introduced by 
that grouping of indirect contributors.

The third source of bias is confirmation 
bias. Because we use our entire dataset 
for exploratory analysis, we cannot test 
specific hypotheses. Until we develop 
a collection method for data breaches 
beyond a sample of convenience, this is 
probably the best that can be done.

As stated above, we attempt to mitigate 
these biases by collecting data from 
diverse contributors. We follow a 
consistent multiple\-review process, and 
when we hear hooves, we think horses, 
not zebras.64 We also try to review 
findings with subject matter experts in 
the specific areas ahead of release. 

Non\-incident 
data

Since the 2015 issue, the DBIR includes 
data that requires the analysis that 
did not fit into our usual categories of 
“incident” or “breach.” Examples of 
non\-incident data include malware, 
patching, phishing and DDoS. The 
sample sizes for non\-incident data tend 
to be much larger than the incident 
data but from fewer sources. We 
make every effort to normalize the 
data (for example, weighting records 
by the number contributed from the 
organization so all organizations are 
represented equally). We also attempt 
to combine multiple partners with 
similar data to conduct the analysis 
wherever possible. Once analysis is 
complete, we try to discuss our findings 
with the relevant partner or partners so 
as to validate it against their knowledge 
of the data. 

Data subsets

We already mentioned the subset 
of incidents that passed our quality 
requirements, but as part of our 
analysis there are other instances 
where we define subsets of data. These 
subsets consist of legitimate incidents 
that would eclipse smaller trends if left 
in. These are removed and analyzed 
separately, though may not be written 
about if no relevant findings were, well, 
found. This year we have two subsets 
of legitimate incidents that are not 
analyzed as part of the overall corpus:

1\. We separately analyzed a subset of 
web servers that were identified as 
secondary targets (such as taking 
over a website to spread malware). 

2\. We separately analyzed botnet\- 

related incidents. 

Both subsets were separated the last 
six years as well.

Finally, we create some subsets to 
help further our analysis. In particular, 
a single subset is used for all analysis 
within the DBIR unless otherwise 
stated. It includes only quality incidents 
as described above and excludes the 
aforementioned two subsets.

64 A unique finding is more likely to be something mundane, such as a data collection issue, 

than an unexpected result.

Appendix B: 
VERIS mappings to 
MITRE ATT\&CK®

When it comes to sailing the stormy 
seas of the cybersecurity world, a map 
comes in handy to help you chart your 
direction. We consider the DBIR to be 
one of those maps, helping organizations 
navigate the complicated and ever\-
changing conditions of the cybersecurity 
landscape. To make sure this map is the 
most accurate possible, we have created 
the VERIS Framework,65 which captures 
most of the important components of 
data breaches in order to facilitate risk\-
oriented decision making for our weary 
cyber mariners. 

Over the years, new guiding frameworks 
have been created that provide different 
levels of detail, MITRE ATT\&CK® being 
by far the most popular. We have worked 
with MITRE Engenuity and the Center for 
Threat Informed Defense66 to capture the 
relationships between VERIS to ATT\&CK 
so that organizations can leverage the 
benefits of both in their navigation. 

The results of that work are remarkable: 
ATT\&CK provides excellent tactical 
and technical details into the specific 
techniques the threat actors leverage, 
while VERIS provides a strategic view of 
the landscape, covering a wider range 
of possible mishaps. Errors, for instance, 
are present in 9% percent of breaches 
this year but are out of scope in ATT\&CK. 
When VERIS and ATT\&CK are combined, 
they provide you with a clearer view 
of what type of assets were impacted 
and what type of victims those assets 
belonged to while still preserving the 
specifics of the attack techniques that 
were leveraged. 

This combination of forces is timely due 
to the increased regulatory pressure of 
reporting data breaches to governments, 
although there is no commonly accepted 
format in how this reporting should be 
done. We, of course, cannot opine on 
the need for such regulations,67 but we 
would like to do our part to make sure 
that organizations have the right tooling 
to reduce their burden as new laws come 
to fruition.

The second version of this mapping 
has just been released as of April 6, 
2023, and we are very excited about 
it. In addition to VERIS Actions, a lot of 
thought was put into mapping Attributes. 
To make it better, Actors were mapped 
to ATT\&CK Groups.68 There are also new 
mappings to ATT\&CK for Mobile and 
ATT\&CK for ICS.

If this interests you at all, please hop over 
to https://center\-for\-threat\-informed\-
defense.github.io/attack\_to\_veris/ 
for all the details of the work. Even if 
it doesn’t,69 you are already reaping 
the benefits of the work thanks to the 
ATT\&CK Technique mappings we 
have added to some select Incident 
Patterns to help you in your epic 
journey to “full control coverage.” 

Our team puts a lot of thought and 
energy into trying to make the VERIS 
Framework more accessible and helpful 
for all. If you are curious about the 
framework or have tried it in the past and

Appendix C: 
VTRAC 20\-year 
retrospective

By Chris Novak, 
Managing Director 
Cyber Security Consulting 
Verizon

It’s hard to believe that the Verizon 
Threat Research Advisory Center 
(VTRAC) is 20 years old! I’ve had 
the unique pleasure of being part of 
the team since the very beginning—
or should I say the “zero\-day”? 

Over those 20 years, we’ve had a few 
different names but always the same 
passionate team behind the scenes. 
Back then, I was part of a small gaggle 
of geeks in New York City, always 
having a suitcase packed and ready 
to hop a flight to anywhere to take on 
the next big data breach investigation. 
Our forensic lab at the time was a 
collection of systems that didn’t even 
fill a single full\-height server rack. 

It bears reminding that, 20 years ago, 
“cybersecurity” was not a commonly 
used or understood word. If you asked 
the average person what “cyber” was, 
you would probably get back responses 
that sounded like something from a 
science fiction movie. There was no such 
thing as a cybersecurity college degree—
the closest thing that existed at the time 
was a computer science or engineering 
degree. Today, there are hundreds of 
universities around the world that not only 
offer cybersecurity bachelor’s degrees, 
but also master’s degrees and Ph.D.s.

I can still remember some of the first 
data breaches I ever investigated. Old 
timers will appreciate the days when 
we showed up onsite with our “medical 
bag” —typically a bag that had a binder 
of bootable floppy disks, a collection of 
assorted cables, and a variety of hard 
drives and enclosures. As mentioned 
above, hardly anyone knew what 
cybersecurity was back then, and the 
average person had no idea of the 
purpose of the equipment in that medical 
bag. In a world just following 9/11, going 
through airport security with that bag 
of odd\-looking electronics and cables 
guaranteed that I was frequently the 
lucky winner of “random” extra screening. 
If only that luck carried over into a few of 
the trips to Vegas … 

Today, we rarely need to travel. We 
have enterprise tools that can facilitate 
remote forensic evidence collection 
from anywhere in the world. Taking 
advantage of our telecommunications 
backbone and advances in cellular 
connectivity, we’re even able to provide 
immediate emergency and out\-of\-band 
communications via 5G, allowing us to 
collect forensic data at speeds in excess 
of 1 Gbps, even if the victim organization 
has its own network, systems or 
infrastructure outages.

The then and now comparisons over 
the last 20 years are staggering to 
consider. Today, we have exponentially 
more people on our team, with incredible 
diversity of backgrounds and geographic 
locations. The VTRAC supports 

organizations across more than 100 
countries. We not only have several 
physical lab locations around the world 
but also cloud\-based and client on\-
premises lab locations to care for nearly 
every conceivable data privacy and 
sovereignty concern.

Of course, I cannot forget to mention the 
incredible work of the DBIR team that 
makes this very publication possible. 
Many have heard me say that the DBIR 
is my third child. It was born 16 years 
ago as part of an early incarnation of 
VTRAC (back then we were called the 
RISK Team) with a vision of sharing our 
data breach insights with the world. 
Metaphorically, I heard it say its first 
words and watched it take its first 
steps alongside the other co\-creators. 
Thankfully, I don’t have to save for the 
DBIR’s college tuition.70

I couldn’t be prouder of what the past and 
present members of the VTRAC have 
built and accomplished over the past 20 
years. It is the passion and dedication 
of each and every team member that 
contributes to our long client tenure, 
never having missed a contractual 
service level agreement, world\-class 
thought leadership and consistent 
rating as a leader by industry analysts. 

I look forward to the adventures, 
innovation and excitement to come 
in our next 20 years!

Happy 20th birthday, VTRAC!

—Chris Novak

70 Editor’s note: We hope the DBIR is actually helping you pay for tuition for your human children.
