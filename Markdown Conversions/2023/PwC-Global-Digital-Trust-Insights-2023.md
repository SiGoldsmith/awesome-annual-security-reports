# A C-suite united on cyber-ready futures
Findings from the 2023 Global Digital Trust Insights

Driven by events no one could have foreseen, leaders in recent years have pushed their companies and themselves beyond their comfort zones: out of the office to remote workplaces; into the cloud; along chains of supply that are almost completely digital. And with each new venture has come new cyber risks.
CISOs and cyber teams are rising to the challenge. C-suites are joining forces with them, recognising that their bold moves have increased their organisations’ cyber risk exposure.

Cyber has progressed on many fronts, C-suite execs report

26% say they accomplished all 10

# Good news: progress in cybersecurity since 2020
More than 70% of the 3,522 business and tech executives we surveyed saw improvements in their enterprise’s cybersecurity this year — thanks to cumulative investments and C-suite collaboration. More than a quarter (26%) reported progress in all 10 of the areas we identified as critical to cyber maturity.

It’s a bold new world in business.

# High marks for CISOs and their teams from other execs
Among those who saw improvement across the 10 areas:
- CEOs are 3x more likely to say their CISOs are delivering exceptional results in outcomes like responding faster to threats and anticipating future cyber risks. Nearly 8% said the CISO is doing so in every area.
- CROs/COOs are 2x more likely to rate as exceptional their cyber and privacy programmes. More than 5% said their programmes are doing so in every outcome.
- CMOs/CDOs/CPOs are 2.5x more likely to agree that their cyber and privacy programmes are valuable to the organisation. Their greatest benefit: confidence in the ability to nurture consumer trust.

% to which organisations have mitigated cyber risks associated with these

Fewer than 40% of respondents say they have fully mitigated the risks their bold moves incurred since 2020. Remote work (38%) and the move to the cloud (35%) have commanded the most attention. Larger organisations (more than $1 billion in revenues) and those based in North America are far more likely to have said they’ve mitigated these risks. Less than 3% of respondents say they have done so fully with all 10 risks.

# CISOs see the need to advance further on five cyber capabilities
By their own assessment, CISOs see the need to advance further on five basic cyber capabilities outlined in the US National Institute of Security and Technology’s (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. Only three percent responded that they were “optimising” in all five.

```

Larger organisations with revenues greater than $1 billion are more likely to say they’re optimising for Identify (21%). Those that have seen revenue increases and expect increases to continue are more likely to be optimising for all.

# Organisations worry about more threats and cyber events in 2023
Senior executives worry that their enterprise isn’t fully prepared to address heightened threats. Topping the 2023 list of rising organisational threats are cybercriminal activity (65%); mobile devices (41%), email (40%), cloud-based breaches (38%); and business email compromise/account takeover (33%) and ransomware (32%).

# New challenges for 2023
- Only 9% of the respondents feel highly confident that they can effectively meet all disclosure requirements — even as pressure mounts from regulators to report cyber incidents.

In Europe, for instance, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) requires that critical service providers to report to national authorities in the event of any significant cybersecurity incident.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission is considering a rule that would require publicly held companies to disclose their cyber risk management, strategy, governance and “material” cyber incidents.

And proposed US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) rules, mandated by the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA) signed into law last March, would require organisations in 16 critical infrastructure sectors to report major cyber attacks and breaches within 72 hours and to report within 24 hours any ransomware payments they make.
- Senior executives are bracing not only for a catastrophic cyber attack but also for global recession, a new health crisis, persistent inflation, and supply chain bottlenecks. Yet only 7% approach resilience in an integrated fashion.
- Consumers, consumer-friendly regulators, privacy advocates and ESG activists are gaining ground. Data security and privacy are the Achilles’ heel of many organisations. Fewer than 5% of senior executives say they always implement 10 standard and leading practices to protect and govern customer data.

Cyber events
% who say these attacks to their organisation will increase from 2022 to 2023
```
Business email compromise / Account takeovers 33%
Ransomware 32%
Attacks against cloud management interfaces 31%
Hack-and-leak operations 30%
Third-party breach 29%
Exploits of cloud component services 28%
Software supply chain compromise 26%
Theft of intellectual property for the purpose of commercialisation 26%
Attacks on industrial internet of things (IIoT) or OT 26%
Distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks 25%
Exploitation of misconfiguration 23%
Exploits of zero-day vulnerabilities 23%
Disinformation 22%
Unauthorised cryptomining 20%
Hardware supply chain implants 19%
Nation-state traditional espionage (cyber and / or physical aspects) 17%
Nation state-sponsored attack on critical infrastructure 11%
None of the above 3%

Q: Which of the following attacks to your organisation do you expect to significantly increase in 2023 compared to 2022?
Base: 3,522

Senior executives are bracing not only for a catastrophic cyber attack but also for global recession, a new health crisis, high inflation, and supply chain bottlenecks. Yet only eight percent approach resilience in an integrated fashion.

# C-suite playbook on cyber
Cybersecurity has become a dynamic field, rapidly adjusting and shifting to keep apace with business inventiveness.
Agility is what’s needed for the tougher challenges ahead. How can you continue to make a difference? Where should CISOs and cyber teams wield influence for the greatest effect?
The C-suite playbook on cybersecurity, featuring our latest Global Digital Trust Insights, highlights what you’ve done, what you’re doing now, and what you need to do to tackle the challenges of 2023 — with your fellow executives, all working together to build cyber-ready futures.

# Cyber in the suite spot
CISO are seizing the initiative to truly lead — to step out of their independent cyber-specialist role and into one of partnering with not just with a few executives, but the entire C-suite. These collaborations have never been more critical.
Forty-two percent of senior executives say cyber breaches of their systems have increased since 2020. Executives and boards should ask again and again, “Are we affected?” and, if not, “Are we vulnerable?”
More than a quarter had a consequential data breach in the past three years that cost more than $1 million. Around 10% suffered costs of $10 million or more, CISOs and CFOs reported.
To CFOs, the most devastating consequences when a breach (other than a data breach) occurred were:
- Downtime or disruptions
- Damage to service and product quality
- Lost contracts and business opportunities

To privacy and data executives who work with the public, a breach’s most dire effects were:
- Lost customers
- Costs to recover data (not counting ransom payments)
- Lost customer data (if not recovered)

These gut-wrenching moments can serve as a catalyst to collaboration, sharpening awareness of a single breach’s ripple effects from shop floor to boardroom and calling the entire C-suite to act — together.
As a result, the C-suite has renewed its resolve to do better on cyber and privacy. To get there, top executives are starting to understand the need to work as a cohesive unit — the “suite” spot.
At the center is the CISO, empowered by the CEO to advocate, collaborate, and orchestrate a better cyber future. Forty-six percent of CEOs — 49% at previously breached organisations — want to give the CISO more authority to drive collaboration on security next year.

A note:
Management teams are organised differently around the world, so we may refer to C-suite titles that might not exist in your organisation.
Consider the titles as shorthand for the executive tasked with cybersecurity in the organisation (CISO) who works with the executives responsible for the overall business (CEO), management oversight and governance (the board), technology infrastructure (CIO / CTO), cyber investments (CFO), operations and supply chain (COO), risk management (CRO), data (CDO / CPO) and human resources (CHRO).

# CEOs take a more active stance on cybersecurity this year
More than half of CEOs say they’ll demand a cyber risk management plan for each major business or operational change. And more than half say they’ll spearhead major initiatives such as streamlining the supply chain and eliminating products that weaken the enterprise’s cyber posture.
CEOs at companies that have suffered breaches in the past are even more determined to change how cyber gets done.
CEOs want more information to help them do a better job overseeing their organisations’ cyber programmes. More than 35% prioritise three areas for better reporting:
- Cyber risk assessments and practices
- Business continuity plans, contingency, and recovery plans in the case of a cyber incident
- A dashboard on key cyber risks

CISOs are learning how to give their CEOs just the right information on their cyber programme and the risks their organisation faces.

Message to the CEO
Where can you, the CEO, make the most difference in cybersecurity? Big changes may be the most effective way to improve cyber posture — and only you can instigate them.
Are you tolerating avoidable, unnecessary complexities in your operations and technologies? This needs to change. But so often, investigations after a major cyber breach reveal weaknesses more systemic than technological, caused by a lack of focus among enterprise leaders on addressing weaknesses that teams knew existed. Are you ready to support a dramatic turnaround? It could be the most effective fix.
Perhaps a disconnect among your senior executives or between your business and cyber functions is slowing your efforts at growth — an app for consumer use, perhaps; a new business line that uses artificial intelligence; expansion into a new market; or the use of the Industrial Internet of Things in your factory. Isn’t it time you joined forces to secure it all?

CEOs forging ahead to tackle cyber insecurity — and win
% of CEOs who say they plan to personally be involved in cyber matters
```
Drive major initiatives that improve cyber posture 52%
Require a cyber risk management plan for each of our major business or operational changes 51%
Demand more frequent updates on cyber risks and mitigation measures 48%
Empower and give the CISO authority to drive C-suite collaboration on cybersecurity 46%
Drive priorities for cyber spending 37%

CALL TO ACTION: Speak out about your commitment to cyber. Use your influence to inspire sweeping changes and create a united front against attacks. Rally the C-suite around the notion that the secure way could truly be the easier way to business success.

# Boards can spur better cyber reporting to improve oversight
Boards are more engaged in cyber as their companies face increasing risks. Fifty-four percent say their organisation has taken on more cyber risks as it pursues more digitisation, and 44% report an increase in cyber breaches into their system since 2020.
They recognise the challenge of keeping up with cyber. Today, less than half of board respondents say that their board governs cyber “very effectively” in six areas. Fewer than half, for instance, say they “very effectively” understand the causes and effects of cyber risks (37%) or oversee the alignment of cyber risk management to business needs (43%). Only 9% of board respondents say that their board governs cyber “very effectively” across all areas.
But the future of cyber oversight could be different. Corporate directors are willing to learn about cyber and devote time to it. They say these will help them do a better job governing cybersecurity in 2023:
- Internal board training by management (47%)
- Increased frequency of meetings focused on cyber (47%)
- Improved reporting on cyber incidents, practices, and improvements (44%)
- Adding a board member with cyber expertise (43%)

CISOs and the C-suite can help boards get savvy about the cybersecurity of their organisation, especially on these top improvements that boards would like to see in cyber reporting:
- A scorecard / dashboard that helps board members understand the key cyber risks to the organisation with relevant metrics
- The organisation’s cybersecurity strategy and how it is aligned with its overall strategy
- The business continuity, contingency and recovery plans in the event of a cyber incident

Boards know they need to be better cyber stewards
```
Oversight of the alignment of cyber risk management to the business’ needs
Understanding the drivers and impacts of cyber risks to the organisation
Alignment of cyber investments against the most important risks
Overseeing the organisation’s collaboration with public sector on cyber matters
Monitoring the organisation’s systemic resilience to cyber threats
Understanding how the organisation’s design supports cybersecurity goals
```
Q: In your view, how well do you in your role as a board member exercise governance over the following areas of cybersecurity in your organisation today?
Base: 124 corporate directors

Very effective
Moderately effective
Slightly effective
Not at all
```
9% say their board governance is very effective on all 6 counts

# The new era of cyber transparency
Stakeholders clamor for more information about how companies manage their cyber risk exposure.
Regulators want visibility into cyber practices because they want to protect citizens from fraud and loss of privacy, help investors make better decisions, and prevent industry- or system-wide disruptions. India has published guidance on cyber incident notification required under the Information Technology Act. The UK Financial Reporting Council has issued guidance about digital security risk disclosures after it found that current disclosures by some FTSE 350 companies are not meeting investor needs and are often ‘boilerplate’ and overly static. In addition to the rules pending with the Securities and Exchange Commission (proposal) and the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (law), the New York State Department of Financial Services is weighing a proposal that turns leading practices into regulatory requirements for covered entities.
Investors are looking for consistent and comparable disclosures so they can put their money in companies that fit their needs. Cyber incidents can affect shareholder value — temporarily or permanently.
Individuals know how their data and privacy are vulnerable to cyber breaches. Business partners want their data and other assets to be safe. These stakeholders want to understand how much they can trust in the ability of businesses and entire systems to withstand increasing cyber threats.
The C-suite sees an upside to all this transparency. Four-fifths of senior executives in our survey agree that mandatory disclosure of cyber incidents, with comparable and consistent formats, is necessary to gain stakeholder confidence and trust. But fewer than 10% are confident that their enterprise can comply. More than half are not confident that they:
- Can provide required information about a material or significant incident within the required reporting period after the incident (58% not confident)
- Can assess the materiality of a cyber incident for purposes of reporting (58%)
- Can describe the relevant cyber expertise on the board for purposes of reporting (59%)
- Have a policy stating which information can or cannot be disclosed regarding cyber incidents (60%)
- Can provide information about third-party risk management (63%)

Message to corporate directors
CALL TO ACTION: First, allot more time to the CISO and cyber matters on your agenda. Second, don’t settle for board reporting that doesn’t give you confidence and insights that the organisation is managing the cyber risks related to its strategic moves. Cybersecurity is not an end state, so monitor how the company is making progress in its cyber posture and ability to defend against emerging threats. Ask to take part in exercises that help you understand your organisation’s cyber resilience.

CALL TO ACTION: CISOs can position their teams to work with the CFO, general counsel and other senior executives to prepare to translate strategy and practices into an accurate, cohesive and compelling narrative on the company’s cyber risk management practices. The new era of cyber transparency means that CISOs should become adept at presenting information in a way that the board, senior management and investors can understand and act upon. It requires a communication strategy that’s different from the everyday jargon of cybersecurity.

“There’s a transformation happening here. Information security is being seen as an enterprise capability, not just a technical capability.”
- Ian Schneller, CISO, Health Care Service Corporation

# CIOs, CTOs, and CISOs tackle cloud security
“Is our cloud security plan as agile as our business is, itself, in the cloud?” That’s the question CIOs and CISOs should be asking now.
Cloud-based threats are increasing at nearly 40% of organisations. Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds of senior executives say they haven’t fully mitigated the risks of cloud adoption.
The news isn’t all negative. Half of CISOs, CIOs and CTOs say they’ve made progress in putting governance in place, credential management, resource permissioning, cloud security configurations and API management.
But only 19% are “very confident” that their organisation has adequately secured all these common cloud-breach pathways.
The CIO or CTO and their DevOps team may feel eager — or pressured — to take advantage of the agility, speed and collaboration working in the cloud affords.

Cloud security initiatives are paying off, but more work remains
```
Credential / secrets management
Resource permissioning / public vs private configuration of storage
Cloud security setting failures / misconfigurations
Poor API management
```
Q: With regard to your cloud environment, how confident are you that your organisation is secured appropriately against the following reasons for cloud security breaches?
Base: 1,253 CIOs, CISOs, CTOs and other senior IT and security executives
Source: PwC 2023 Global Digital Trust Insights Survey
```
Very confident
Somewhat confident
Not at all confident
Don't know / Not applicable
```
Only 19% are very confident that their cloud environment is secured appropriately against all four

They may allow developers to stand up projects in a cloud environment before security is in place, or “lift and shift” existing systems into the cloud with plans to secure them later. These personnel may sidestep the CISO to avoid the methodical, security-first approach the CISO would almost certainly advise. In the fast-paced digital world, the business side knows, enterprises need speed to achieve their objectives. When agility and speed are the goals, who needs brakes?
But cohesive governance is key, especially in a multi-cloud environment where each cloud service provider has different security abilities and requirements. Frequent releases of new features and updates means that, like the clouds in the sky, your enterprise cloud environment is continually changing. In 2023, it’s time to design an overarching security architecture that includes all the cloud platforms your enterprise is using.
Bring together all your enterprise security controls so you can secure them from one location, and with as much automation as possible.
Build infrastructure-as-code (IaC) and DevSecOps tooling to automatically set the right security checks on all your cloud platforms.

Message to CIOs and CTOs
Form alliances with your CISO and DevSecOps team. Adopt the “shift left” paradigm and start putting in place cloud security mechanisms before cloud use begins — or, if it’s too late for that, as soon as possible.
Fast development and strong controls can go hand-in-hand. Leading companies design and administer controls that operate not at the sluggish pace often associated with oversight, but at the quick and agile speed of DevOps. In these organisations, everyone wins.
CISOs might provide developers with cloud security services that are easy to use and conform to the organisation’s security policies. Building an encryption API for developer use, for instance, can help speed an application’s time to market as well as confirm that encryption uses company-approved protocols.

CALL TO ACTION: To secure your back-end, front-end, IoT and operational technologies, work with the CISO to lock down your cloud environments.

CFOs and CISOs get serious about cyber investment risks vs. rewards
Companies continue to increase their spending on cybersecurity. Sixty-five percent of senior executives tell us they expect an increase in 2023, compared to 69% in 2022.
But they aren’t increasing cyber budgets as much as they did for 2022. While more than a quarter of enterprises expected 2022 cyber outlays to rise by more than 10%, fewer than one-fifth expect that rate of escalation next year.
Not surprisingly, organisations that have been breached were significantly more likely to say that they would boost their 2023 cyber spending: 68% versus 55% that have not been breached. And among larger enterprises (with yearly revenues greater than $1 billion), 10% said their cyber outlays would rise by 15% or more.

# How organisations set their cyber budgets
Many have begun to shift their cyber investment strategy, as well. More than half say they’re choosing “to a great extent” how to spend on cyber in line with seven key parameters, including:
- Aligned with the overall business strategy (55%)
- Reflecting cyber priorities (55%)
- Adding value to the organisation (52%)
- Balancing immediate and long-term needs (51%)
- Informed by risk quantification (51%)
- Considers the risk appetite of the organisation (51%)
- Allocated well against the risks that the organisation faces (51%)

We saw this shift coming in our 2021 survey, in which 50% of senior executives said they wanted to see budgets better reflecting business strategy, 44% wanted a better budgeting process and 44% wanted to quantify risks.
Fewer than 8%, however, indicated that they’d made this shift in every area. Respondents from the largest organisations were significantly more likely to say that they’ve evolved how they invest, with 60% saying their spending supports the business strategy, for example.

Modernisation of tech
Cyber tech solutions are at the top of the list of areas that CFOs see as key to improving their organisation’s cyber posture.
Indeed, modernisation, especially of operational technology, is still a problem at many organisations. Outdated tech and managing its vulnerabilities are top barriers to improving security of operational technology, CISOs, CIOs, and CTOs say.
Complexity, too, remains a big concern. Simplifying and consolidating the software portfolio is a top 2023 priority among respondents that have been breached in the past three years. Our 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights report foresaw this trend with 75% reporting that their data, technology and other operations were too complex, causing concerns about cyber risk.
It’s telling that another major focus among the previously breached is the elimination of technical debt — the literal and figurative costs of cutting corners in development for the sake of speed. For the rest, however, it ranks near the bottom of the list of cyber transformation goals.
