Understanding 
Microsoft 
Critical 
Vulnerabilities

While the total number of 

vulnerabilities is an important 

metric for gauging the health of 

an environment, as we will cover 

in this report, vulnerabilities are 

not created equal. 

Some vulnerabilities may pose mostly theoretical risk (low likelihood) and low 

impact if they are exploited, while on the opposite side of the spectrum, other 

vulnerabilities have high likelihoods of exploitation, and their exploitation may 

result in a highly negative impact to the affected organization(s).

Measurement of a vulnerability’s impact will relate to its impact 

Exploitation of ‘critical’ 

to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data within 

a system or organization. The most severe vulnerabilities will

Likely result in total compromise 

impact all three of these basic tenets of information security.

of a device or infrastructure.

Vulnerabilities categorized as ‘critical’ are those with 

characteristics that make their exploitation a potentially high\-

impact security event. 

The way Microsoft classifies the severity rating for a 

vulnerability is distinct from the likelihood of exploitation. 

However, the likelihood of exploitation is far more dynamic as, 

generally speaking, attackers are far more likely to exploit a 

known vulnerability.

Have fewer prerequisites. Usually, 

the attack would not require 

any special access, privileges, or 

advanced knowledge.

Allow code execution without 

user interaction. These generally 

do not rely on a user being 

socially\-engineered.

These are the types of vulnerabilities that keep 

IT admins awake at night and pose the most risk 

and challenges to businesses.

2023 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary Edition

How does Microsoft classify 
critical vulnerabilities?

The National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD) classifies critical vulnerabilities as those given a 

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score of 9\.0 \- 10\.0\. The more enthusiastic readers of 

Microsoft’s vulnerability announcements may have noticed that, while Microsoft now uses CVSS 

3\.1 scoring for their vulnerabilities, they rank severities based on Microsoft’s own Security Update 

Severity Rating System. This rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome, 

should that vulnerability be exploited. 

This means that, while only 22 Microsoft 

vulnerabilities from 2022 scored a nine or 

above (making them “critical” under the 

National Vulnerability Database scoring 

system), Microsoft has classified 89 of its 

vulnerabilities as critical.

Description

Critical

A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution without user interaction. These scenarios include 
self\-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs 
without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email. Microsoft recommends that 
customers apply Critical updates immediately.

Important

A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, 
or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where a client 
is compromised with warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt’s provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of 
user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered. Microsoft recommends that customers apply 
Important updates at the earliest opportunity.

Moderate

Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or 
applicability only to non\-default configurations. Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the 
security update.

Low

Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft 
recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems.

Microsoft’s severity rating system may offer better insights for prioritization of risk reduction.

2023 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary Edition

The difference between CVSS scoring and Microsoft’s severity 
rating system is worth noting, not only when considering the data 
in this report, but also when considering risk in your organization. 
CVSS scores measure the technical severity of a vulnerability. 

For example, whether a vulnerability results in some loss of data confidentiality or total loss of 

confidentiality. CVSS scoring does not measure the risk of that vulnerability. This means CVSS scores 
alone cannot tell you whether a vulnerability will cause a mission\-critical impact on a system, or if the 

limited loss of some highly sensitive data would have a more severe impact than the total loss of non\-

sensitive data. 

Microsoft’s severity rating system is potentially far more useful than a base or temporal CVSS score 

for security practitioners trying to prioritize risk reduction. However, it is important to know your own 

environment and risks so you can understand how best to prioritize patches and/or use other security 

hardening controls and mitigations.

All of the data provided by Microsoft’s severity rating system is based on the information that 

was available at the time, and lacks the context of your own organization’s threat models. What is 

considered a critical patch for one organization may not be so for another organization—it all depends 

on the business context.

In addition to their Security Update Severity Rating System, Microsoft also published an Exploitability 

Index to help customers understand the likelihood of exploitation. This can be useful information 

for those needing help with prioritization of security updates. As a word of caution, this information 

reflects the likelihood of exploitation at the time the security update was published. It may not reflect 

the real\-world exploitability that develops in the following weeks or months as more threat actors 

weaponize the vulnerability. The index is best used for very short\-term prioritization of updates rather 

than as a justification to significantly delay patching.

2022 set a new high for the number of Microsoft vulnerabilities, edging ahead of the previous highwater 

mark set in 2020 by 2%. However, if we look at the longer\-term trend, we can see that the number of 

vulnerabilities appears to be plateauing a little after years of significant growth.

Why are we seeing this pattern? To quote The Notorious B.I.G., “Mo Money Mo Problems,” and this 
appears to be very much the case for Microsoft. To increase their revenue, they create new products and 

improve existing ones. At the same time, these new offerings potentially increase the attack surface by 

providing new code.

In addition, the more customers you have, the more people are looking at your software—from internal 

research teams to external pen testers, as well as ill\-bent nation states and cyber criminals.

So, does “Mo Money” really cause “Mo Problems?” While this isn’t an exact measure, if we look at Microsoft’s 
total revenue from 2013 to 2022 and compare that with the total number of Microsoft vulnerabilities, we can see 

a similar trend, with both revenue and vulnerabilities almost doubling between 2017 and 2020\.

Moreover, if we drill down into the product areas with the biggest growth, we see Microsoft Azure and 

Dynamics 365 not only making the biggest financial gains for the company (cloud revenue accounted for 51\.4% 

of Microsoft’s total revenue in 2022\), but also representing the largest gain in vulnerabilities, as represented by 

both the increase in number of vulnerabilities (70\) and the percentage increased (159%) in 2022\.

The number of critical Microsoft 

vulnerabilities reached their lowest point 

across the 10 years of this report. 

Critical Microsoft vulnerabilities dropped 

55% since 2020, indicating a decrease in 

the overall level of risk associated with 

individual vulnerabilities.

In this 10th year of the Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report, we saw two records set 
for vulnerabilities that seem to highlight opposing trends. While the total number of 
Microsoft vulnerabilities reached its highest recorded number in 2022, the number of critical 

vulnerabilities hit their lowest number, with less than half the number of critical vulnerabilities 

appearing in 2022 than we saw in 2020\. In 2022, only 6\.9% of Microsoft’s vulnerabilities were 

rated as ‘critical,’ while in 2013, a substantial 44% of all Microsoft vulnerabilities were classified 

as ‘critical.’ 

This trend indicates that, while overall vulnerabilities have increased in number, the risks and 

worst\-case scenarios associated with these individual vulnerabilities have decreased from 

previous years. This also indicates that, while the overall Microsoft attack surface is expanding 

along with the expansion of Microsoft’s business, the organization is doing a better job at 

minimizing the most dangerous types of development errors.

Microsoft has made significant investments in security improvements over the years, and we 

believe this is reflected in the downward trend in the number of critical Microsoft vulnerabilities. 

Many of Microsoft’s products have had a very long tail of support, which means these security 

improvements are happening as organizations transition to more up\-to\-date and secure 

products, as well as to more SaaS instances, where everyone is kept on the latest version.

As critical vulnerabilities become scarcer, attackers may need to chain 

multiple, less severe exploits together to gain code execution, elevate 

privileges, and move around the network. 

From a defender’s point of view, this is a good thing because it requires 

a higher level of attacker skill and reduces the number of possible 

adversaries. It also provides more potential points to detect, intercept, 

and mitigate a breach. 

If an attacker needs to chain three or more vulnerabilities together to 
reach their objective, then you just need to have mitigated or patched 

one of them to break the chain.

Remote Code Execution and 

Elevation of Privilege remain the 

top vulnerability categories.

Each Microsoft Security Bulletin is comprised of one or more vulnerabilities, 
applying to one or more Microsoft products. Microsoft typically groups 
vulnerabilities into these main categories: Remote Code Execution (RCE), 
Elevation of Privilege (EoP), Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS), 

Spoofing, Tampering, and Security Feature Bypass. 

In 2022, Elevation of Privilege and Remote Code Execution continued 

Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities 

to tower over the other vulnerability categories. 

With that aside, Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities continue their 

strong growth trajectory, while Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities 

skyrocketed to 715 in 2022, a 22% increase 

over 2021, and a whopping 689% increase 

since 2017\.

have been declining slightly over the past three years.

Remote Code Execution continued its slight 

downward trend following its 2020 peak,

What are the vulnerability 
categories telling us? 

Vulnerability levels may be changing, but hackers’ objectives 
remain the same, keeping emphasis on Remote Code Execution 
and Elevation of Privilege.

As we discussed above, having fewer critical vulnerabilities means attackers have fewer easy paths to totally 

compromise a system in one move. This is good news for organizations; however, an attacker’s objective 

remains unchanged: they want to get their code to run, and they want it to be able to run with enough 

privileges that they can execute their malicious intent. 

To achieve this objective, attackers need to have Remote Code Execution, the ability to launch their code on a 

target system, and Elevation of Privilege to make sure this code runs with enough privilege. This is reflected in 

the finding that Remote Code Execution and Elevation of Privilege remain the highest Microsoft vulnerability 

categories, as highlighted in this report. In particular, the number of Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities 

across the Microsoft environment has been on a steep upward trajectory over the past three years. 

The data from this report reflects that, as of 2022, Microsoft is making continued progress at reducing the 

number of critical vulnerabilities and removing excessive privileges, especially on endpoints. This is driving 

the need for attackers to exploit Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities to succeed.

Always ensure your operating system and third\-party 

software are up\-to\-date and you are not using end\-of\-life 

software in your environment.

Always ensure you are removing excessive privileges, 

especially on endpoints.

Unsurprisingly, the SANS Institute’s CIS Controls, the Australian Cyber Security Centre 

(ACSC)’s Essential 8 Cyber Risk Controls, and NIST’s (SP 800\-207\) Zero Trust Architecture 

also highlight these as essential cybersecurity controls for threat prevention and mitigation.

2017\-2021 includes Internet Explorer, which was discontinued 
last year. 2022 figures are for Edge only.

After a nearly four\-fold spike 

in 2021, Microsoft Edge total 

vulnerabilities decreased by 

11%, to 311 vulnerabilities in 

2022; critical vulnerabilities 

continue to plummet

Those who are not familiar with what happened under the hood of Edge in recent years may be wondering 

what on Earth happened in 2020, when critical vulnerabilities suddenly plummeted and total vulnerabilities 

rocketed. This was when Microsoft ditched their own in\-house browser engine and rebuilt Edge around 

Chromium. The benefits of this move were that, going forward, Microsoft could leverage the more mature 

and open source Chromium engine to resolve their critical vulnerability challenges, as well as a range of 

compatibility issues that often drove customers to only use Edge once—to download the Chrome installer. 

The Chromium project benefits from being open source and ubiquitous enough to attract a lot of focus from 

the security research community. This focus has allowed it to rapidly mature. While other browsers may have 

a lower overall vulnerability count than Edge (or Chrome), this does not necessarily make them more secure. 

The Edge vulnerability trends are a good example of what happens when there is no easy path for an attacker. 

A critical vulnerability in a browser may allow an attacker to gain privileged execution on a system just by 

having the victim click a malicious link. However, with no easy path, attackers are forced to string together 

multiple less severe vulnerabilities to get from point A to point B.

Windows critical 

vulnerabilities continue 

to trend downwards, 

following Windows 7 

EOL and the shift to 

virtualization\-based\-
security (VBS).

In 2020, the end of Windows 7 support forced users to upgrade to the Windows 10 operating 

system, eliminating many known vulnerabilities. This accounted for the steep, 44% drop in the 

number of Microsoft Windows vulnerabilities from 2020 to 2021\.

Windows 10 has been around since 2015, and Windows 11, while only launched in 2021, shares 

the same core as Windows 10\. This means the OS is less likely to introduce any major new 

vulnerabilities. Moreover, some security issues have been addressed by using virtualization\-

based security (VBS). VBS isolates untrusted websites and Office documents from the user 

data and protects key areas, such as credential stores, by providing hardware\-level isolation and 
preventing pass\-the\-hash type attacks. This helps ensure protection even in the event the OS is 

compromised.

While Windows total vulnerabilities increased slightly in 2022 (returning to near 2018 levels), 

Windows critical vulnerabilities have continued a downward trend since these changes came 

into play. We expect an overall downward trend to continue, although progress will come in small 

increments because there remains a lot of legacy code.

The Microsoft Office products category experienced a 45% drop in vulnerabilities in 2022, 

while critical vulnerabilities increased from a low of one in 2021 to two instances in 2022\. 

While there is an overarching downward trend in the number of Microsoft Office vulnerabilities that 

stretches back five years, Office applications have remained a successful target for threat actors. 

This is largely due to the lag times between discovery and patching, as demonstrated by CVE\-2022\-

30190 and CVE\-2022\-34713, both detailed below.

Along with patching vulnerabilities, Microsoft has been pushing to cut off common attack vectors, 

such as VBA macros in documents, that have been delivered from the internet. This is an extremely 

common attack vector, but previous mitigation attempts have merely been soft blocks that are easily 

circumvented by socially engineering the end user into enabling macros. 

In 2022, Microsoft stepped up defenses against this attack vector by blocking internet macros by 

default in Office applications. The block did not go as smoothly as planned. Microsoft announced 

the move in February, rolled it out in April, and temporarily rolled back the decision before 

communicating another update about blocking VBA macros by default in the summer—after 

receiving user feedback. This caused considerable confusion. 

So, while we have seen the trends around Microsoft Office vulnerabilities moving in the right 

direction, the road to remediation has been bumpy in 2022\. Hopefully, moving forward, we will see 

a condensing of the lag times between discovery and patching.

Microsoft Office 
Vulnerabilities 
Spotlight

The Common Vulnerabilities and 

Exposures (CVE) system provides 

a reference method for publicly 

known information\-security 

vulnerabilities and exposures.

The Follina Exploit and CVE\-2022\-30190

CVSS base score of 7\.8 and temporal score of 7\.0

While you can never pick a favorite vulnerability, the “Follina” exploit that led to Office vulnerability CVE\-2022\-

30190 certainly was memorable. This was a zero\-day exploit that allowed for Remote Code Execution in Office 

products. Notably, it leveraged the Microsoft Office protocol and MSDT, a Microsoft support tool used to allow 

code to run, even if macros were disabled or when the user simply opened a preview of the file. Follina was 

quickly exploited by threat actors in various attack campaigns.

The timeline and response to this vulnerability was particularly interesting. As early as 2021, researchers raised 

the issue of abusing Office protocols; however, it was initially dismissed as a non\-issue. Over April and May 

of 2022, we began to see reports of these techniques being used in the wild. Other reports were submitted to 

Microsoft, yet no CVE appeared until May 30th. Finally, on the 14th of June, a patch was released. However, by 

this point, Qakbot and various other threat actors were actively exploiting the vulnerability.

DogWalk and CVE\-2022\-34713

CVSS base score of 7\.8 and temporal score of 7\.2

Related to Follina, DogWalk (CVE\-2022–34713\) also exploited the Microsoft support tool MSDT. DogWalk 

was first reported to Microsoft in late 2019, but Microsoft initially took a dismissive stance toward the 

potential impact and significance of the vulnerability. This was surprising, given that the vulnerability 

allowed an attacker to gain code execution by dropping an executable file into a Windows start\-up folder 

when the victim opened a diagcab file.

Because browsers did not view diagcab files as a threat, it made it possible to perform a drive\-by\-download 

and trigger the exploit just by visiting a malicious website. In turn, it also provided a way to bypass the 

“Mark of the web,” where files are marked as coming from the internet and, therefore, treated with a 

lower degree of trust (something that many security solutions monitor). Finally, DogWalk provided a 

straightforward way to gain both execution and persistence by launching payloads on start\-up. 

Only after reports surfaced of the DogWalk zero\-day being exploited in the wild, combined with fresh news 

of the Follina vulnerability, did Microsoft make a U\-turn. In August of 2022, Microsoft decided this was a 

vulnerability to patch and released a security update.

.

What can we learn from DogWalk and 
Follina? The importance of proactively 
recognizing and mitigating vulnerabilities.

While DogWalk was not strictly an Office vulnerability,

The lines between vulnerabilities, bugs, and

Often, the discovery of these kinds of issues just 

scratches the surface of a much larger issue.

The Windows Server category experienced a 4% increase in total vulnerabilities year\-over\-year, while the 

number of critical Windows Server vulnerabilities continued its multi\-year decline, falling by a noteworthy 

23% year\-over\-year. The number of Windows Server critical vulnerabilities has decreased by an impressive 

72% since 2017\.

One concern with regard to Windows Server vulnerabilities is the patching coverage. The Shadowserver 

Foundation reported that, in late December of 2022, nearly 70,000 Microsoft Exchange Server 

implementations were still vulnerable to the ProxyNotShell vulnerabilities (CVE\-2022\-41040 \& CVE\-2022\-

41082\), which were discovered in September of 2022\. 

As with the Windows Print Spooler vulnerabilities (detailed below), even when patched, ProxyNotShell has 

continued to cause issues. In December of 2022, researchers from CrowdStrike discovered “OWASSRF,” a 

method for bypassing the mitigations Microsoft had provided. The OWASSRF exploit has been used by a 

number of ransomware threat actors, including during the attacks on H\-Hotels and Rackspace.

This situation stoked some controversy. For instance, some organizations reportedly held off patching 

due to reports of authentication errors that could have caused downtime, and due to concerns that the 

patch could be bypassed anyway. These kinds of trade\-offs between keeping servers up and running—and 

keeping them secure—can induce cold sweats in IT decision\-makers.

Given the broad range of products Microsoft Azure and Dynamics 365 now covers, this increase might 

not be a huge surprise; however, one particular tool seems to have accounted for the majority of the 

vulnerability growth.

The Azure Site Recovery VMware to Azure tool alone was responsible for 80 vulnerabilities in 2022\. 

Given this suite is part of a disaster recovery service that can automatically fail\-over workloads to a 

secondary location when a problem is detected, it is equally concerning and reassuring to see so many 
vulnerabilities being remediated. 

The majority of the Azure Site Recovery vulnerabilities were categorized as Elevation of Privilege and 

seem to share a root cause of SQL injection (SQLi). The fact that SQLi has been in the OWASP Top 10 list, 

which charts the most common issues in web application security, serves as a timely reminder that we 

need to learn the lessons of the past.

The Vulnerability 
Snowball Effect

Each year, we seek to provide an answer to the question: 

what do the trends mean? Sometimes that answer lies 

as much in human nature as in any technical reason.

We know that the Microsoft ecosystem is vast and provides an ever\-growing potential attack surface. 

While most of the new code added is developed through secure development practices and is less likely 

to introduce new vulnerabilities than in earlier years, there is still a longtail of legacy code that much of the 
ecosystem is built on.

In the case of the Windows operating system, each version has been an evolution of the previous version—

not a total rewrite. This means that, while the Windows NT kernel has evolved a long way since 1993, it has 

also brought along a lot of baggage. 

This is where human nature enters. Every so often, researchers stumble across an area that proves to be 
a goldmine of vulnerabilities. One vulnerability is found and patched, but in the process, this draws fresh 
attention to an area that may have evaded scrutiny in the past. New researchers dig in, only to find new 

vulnerabilities, new attack vectors, and new ways around previous patches—and the vulnerability count 

starts to snowball.

The vulnerability 
snowball effect in action:
The Print Spooler service

What lessons can 
we learn from this? 
As the saying goes, 
‘where there’s 
smoke, there’s fire.’

Keep an eye out for these emerging threats 

so you can make more informed decisions. 

For example, if you saw a rising trend 

in vulnerabilities associated with the 

Windows Print Spooler, while you may 

not have stopped a zero\-day attack, 

you could at least have made sure you 

understood what your exposure was and 

what the potential mitigations were. 

You might have disabled the Print Spooler 

service where it wasn’t necessary, you might 

have made sure you knew which systems 

were exposed, and you might have dug into 

the settings and controls that could be 

applied to change the behavior. None of this 

prevents vulnerabilities, or prevents them 

from being discovered, but it makes your 

organization better poised to protect itself, 

as well as your customers and partners.

from your kids’ homework to your IT incident response.

Microsoft has heavily invested in ChatGPT developer OpenAI since 2019, and has aggressive plans to integrate

A 2022 paper titled “Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?” 
reported that researchers from Stanford found that developers using AI assistants 

to write code are more likely to introduce security vulnerabilities than those who 

don’t rely on AI assistants. 

At the same time, the users of AI assistants were more likely to believe they were writing more secure 

code than their non\-AI augmented counterparts.

The Stanford researchers wrote, “We found that participants with access to an AI assistant often 

produced more security vulnerabilities than those without access, with particularly significant results 

for string encryption and SQL injection.” 

While the Stanford study was limited in scope, it provides valuable insight into the hidden risks of AI—
its capacity to both introduce risk, while, at the same time, reducing our perception of risk. 

As Microsoft starts to harness more AI capabilities in their products, it will interest us greatly to see 

what impact this has on the volume and severity of their published vulnerabilities. Having made such 

significant strides forward in security since the famous 2002 Trustworthy Computing Memo from 

Bill Gates, we can only hope that Bill’s more recent words comparing AI to nuclear energy—“both 

promising and dangerous”—don’t go unheeded.

COMMENTARY

Cybersecurity is an ever\-changing field, with new threats 

Many of Microsoft’s products have supported 

and technologies emerging every day and often making 

media headlines. Last year, we saw cybercriminals 

take advantage of remote working practices – which 

tie directly with the Covid 19 pandemic – to launch 

unprecedented attacks against business networks 

across the globe. 

Furthermore, as deepfakes, AI\-generated phishing 

emails, and other sophisticated methods of social 

engineering become cheaper and more commonplace, 

we’re seeing more and more struggling to protect 

long\-term versions, which allows organisations to 

transition safely to newer and more secure products 

and SaaS instances where everyone stays up to date.

Given the current threat landscape and the 

information contained within BeyondTrust’s report, 

going into 2023, security leaders would be wise to 

enforce least privilege and monitor identity access to 

help them protect against future threats, including 

loss of revenue, IP, reputation, and fines. They can 

further stay ahead of the game by transitioning from 

themselves from data breaches and compliance failures.

less effective Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) 

BeyondTrust’s Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report highlights 

that Microsoft vulnerabilities are still rising year on year 

and that hackers are continuing to use identity theft 

as an attack vector \- with the numbers of remote code 

execution and privilege elevation to reach their targets 

rising. However, it also reveals that the number of critical 

vulnerabilities within these attacks are decreasing. 

As critical vulnerabilities have hit their lowest level in 

ten years, the report suggests that a successful attack 

now requires more advanced skillsets and tooling, 

thus potentially reducing the number of prospective 

attackers. 

This is great news. Microsoft has put a lot of resources 
into security advancements over the years, and it’s 

paying off. 

methods, like SMS and mobile apps, to higher quality 

hardware authenticators, with FIDO authentication 

for added phishing\-resistant protection. 

These should be combined with other best practices, 

like embedding security into business priorities, 

building security awareness amongst staff and 

suppliers, keeping software up to date with the 

latest security patches, monitoring the network for 

suspicious activity, having an effective vulnerability 

management program in place, as well as ensuring 

they have an incident response plan that’s well\-

rehearsed, and backing up data.

COMMENTARY

Just as cyberattacks have increased on a global scale, 

Microsoft has seen a striking rise in vulnerabilities. The 

10\-year trend analysis in this report offers unique and 

valuable insights for security professionals looking to 

secure their organization against current and future 

threats. Let’s first take a look at the current threats.

Gaining admin access to user systems has always been 

like striking a gold mine for attackers. The damage 

from gaining access to a single privileged account is 

catastrophic for many organizations, and responsible 

biometrics will increase. Solutions that leverage 

remote biometrics for identity matching will either 

evolve to detect this technology or be left behind. 

Today, and going forward for advanced protection, 

biometric solutions need to be backed by modern, 

hardware\-based authenticators, such as security 

keys, that work across platforms and add an 

additional layer of security to these options.

To summarize, it is imperative that organizations 

address current threats by implementing strategies 

for a growing number of data breaches in the headlines. 

such as least privilege and monitoring identity access 

As this report shows, it’s critical for organizations to 

implement least privilege and remove unnecessary admin 

rights to proactively mitigate vulnerabilities. 

And what do future threats look like? Well as William 

Gibson once said, “the future is here—it’s just not widely 

distributed”. We are witness to the evolution of machine 

learning and artificial intelligence—happening right now, 

in front of our eyes. These technologies are beginning to 

to reduce the risk (should the worst happen). It is 

also critical for security professionals to stay ahead 

of the curve and consider moving away from legacy 

multi\-factor authentication (MFA) methods, such 

as SMS and mobile apps – and towards portable, 

hardware authenticators based on modern FIDO 
authentication that offer phishing\-resistant MFA 

capabilities.

can validate during authentication.

As deep fake technology becomes more accessible and

in this fast\-moving arms race, we already have

COMMENTARY

Over the past year, I have observed cyber events 

affecting millions of people across the globe. Nowadays, 

corporate infrastructures are exposed to new external 

attack vectors and threats. However, apart from dangers 

arising from working remotely, the 2020s are the decade 

of faster attacks containing rapidly evolving deepfakes, 

sophisticated, AI\-generated phishing emails, and other 

more advanced social engineering actions. We can expect 

that, in 2023, the number of cyber threats will continue to 

evolve and increase. 

Thanks to the Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report, published 

by BeyondTrust, we are able to conclude that hackers’ 

objectives remain unchanged, keeping an emphasis 

on remote code execution and elevation of privileges. 

This is why it is strongly recommended to perform 

regular cybersecurity strategy reviews and various 

types of penetration tests, as they are one of the most 

efficient ways to identify technical vulnerabilities 

in the company’s IT infrastructure before an attack 

occurs. I think that audits and constant efforts to 

improve security are features that characterize 

organizations with mature cybersecurity policies. 

However, I find it promising that Microsoft’s critical 

vulnerabilities hit their lowest number in the ten\-

year history of the Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report. 

Theoretically, it means that a successful attack 

requires a higher level of the hacker’s skillset and 

tooling, so the number of possible adversaries should

COMMENTARY

As CTO of BeyondTrust, and someone with a long 

history of calling attention to Microsoft vulnerabilities, 

it is rewarding to see this report celebrating a 10\-year 

anniversary and continuing to highlight the need to 

keep improving security at Microsoft. 

In the early 2000s, I created security research teams 

with the goal of galvanizing Microsoft and other 

companies to make security a serious focus. Since 

those days, Microsoft has made substantive strides 

forward to improve the security of their code and 

systems. Clearly, vulnerabilities remain, and as we can 

see in this year’s report, they are hitting a record high—

but we can also see where their investment in security 

has paid off, with fewer critical vulnerabilities than 

ever before.

Looking back at the changes over the past decade, 

we can see that security is no longer viewed as a 

third\-party bolt\-on to the operating system, but as 

something that should be baked in. There are lots 

of technical examples of this in the latest generations 

of the Windows OS, which are far more hardened 

and secure by default. These architectural changes 

are a big factor in reducing the number of critical 

vulnerabilities. 

But we shouldn’t relax too much. 

There are still plenty of vulnerabilities to 

discover. The collection of print spooler service 

vulnerabilities discovered over 2022 have shown 

us Microsoft’s “Print Nightmare” that started in 

2021 is not over yet. Beyond that, there remain 

many undiscovered vulnerabilities—some decades 

old—lurking within Microsoft environments for 

researchers and threat actors to explore.

One thing this report has highlighted so well 

over the years is how both patching and the 

timeless concept of least privilege are essential to 

mitigate the risks organizations face. With Remote 

Code Execution (RCE) remaining one of the top 

vulnerability categories over the past decade, we 

need to ensure we are applying least privilege 

across all our estates, on\-prem, hybrid, and cloud to 

ensure any RCE exploits don’t provide an attacker 

with excessive privileges. It is critical to create the 

hurdles an attacker can trip over when attempting 

to exploit a zero day or known vulnerability. 

Stay safe!

COMMENTARY

Vulnerabilities are still the largest attack vector in 

the cloud, and the findings of this year’s Microsoft 

Vulnerabilities Report reaffirm this with resounding 

effect. With a huge, 159% YoY increase in Azure and 

Dynamics 365 vulnerabilities, companies need to be 

more vigilant than ever when it comes to patching and 

security strategies. A big part of mitigating risk begins 

with least privilege – this has been a significant step for 

many years (and still is) when it comes to cloud systems 

and IoT devices.

Perhaps now more than ever, organizations are 

understanding the critical need to prioritize issues based 

on the potential blast radius and business impact of a 

In addition, Server 1 exposes a key to an adjacent 

asset that contains PII. Therefore, the CVE on Server 

1 should be scored as high risk. On the other hand, 

Server 2 is an intranet server that is not publicly 

accessible and exposes no other exploitable risks. 

Therefore, this CVE poses a minimal threat and 

should be scored as informational only.

In last year’s Public Cloud Security Report, 78% of 

identified attack paths use known vulnerabilities 

(CVEs) as an initial access attack vector and, on 

average, require only three steps to reach “crown 

jewel” data. The good news is that most attacker 

entry points can be prevented relatively easily since 

risk. This can only be accomplished when organizations 

these CVEs are known, most have remediations 

have wide visibility and contextual insight into their 

environments. As this report demonstrates, critical 

vulnerabilities carry contextual threat levels and impact, 
especially considering Microsoft’s unique severity rating 

system.

I’ll illustrate this with the following example: Server 1 and 

Server 2 are both web servers that are using a vulnerable 

library (CVE\-2018\-1176\). Without context, the risks on 

Server 1 and Server 2 seem to be the same. However, 

with access to contextual data, we see that Server 1 is 

Internet\-facing and easily accessible to attackers. 

available, and usually, only a very small percentage of 

them are externally exposed. When admin rights are 

removed and identities are effectively secured, the 
decrease in risk is even more significant.

With contextual insight and effective risk 

prioritization, cloud security teams can remediate 

strategically, fix the most dangerous risks first, and 

work smarter, not harder. In addition, by taking 

preventive measures to reduce an attacker’s ability to 

move laterally, such as controlling privileged access, 

organizations can ensure that, even if an attacker 

does gain access, the potential damage is minimized 

and restricted.

Mitigating 
Microsoft\-Based 
Vulnerability 
Risks

Timely patching is an important 
way to minimize the chance of a 
vulnerability\-related breach. 

Yet, with this strategy alone, organizations will 

still be at risk of zero\-day exploits. In addition, 

patching vulnerabilities is not always practical or 

desired by an organization. That’s why it’s crucial 

to have proactive security defenses, such as a 

least privilege posture, in place.

5 Indispensable Mitigation Strategies 
for Securing Your Microsoft Environment: 

1

2

3

4

Implement vulnerability management: Find, prioritize, and determine a remediation path for all 
vulnerabilities. Keep in mind that patching sooner than later can also help you prevent a seemingly 

innocuous vulnerability from snowballing into a bigger threat.

Enforce least privilege, such as by removing local admin rights: This proactive approach can provide 
highly effective protection, even in the absence of patching. Removing local admin rights, and controlling 

execution, has historically mitigated 75% of Microsoft’s critical vulnerabilities, as we have demonstrated in 

past reports where the data was available. That means that, without admin rights, the vulnerability cannot 

be exploited—even if it remains unpatched. A least privilege approach, which is also a core part of zero 

trust security models, can help break multiple points in the attack chain – from account hijacking to lateral 

movement, to privilege escalation, and more. 

Follow security hardening protocols: Always ensure your operating system and third\-party software are 
up\-to\-date and you are not using end\-of\-life software in your environment. In addition, remove unneeded 

privileges, access, and accounts to further reduce the risk surface.

Secure remote access pathways: Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), as well as VPNs and many 
other common remote access technologies, are increasingly stretched beyond their proper use cases, 

resulting in security exposures and breaches. Ransomware, in particular, often uses RDP as an entry 

point. Ensure RDP is not exposed to the internet. Do not allow VPNs and BYOD to mix. Replace VPNs, or 

augment them with zero trust security controls for vendor access and privileged access use cases.

5

Stay vigilant regarding emerging threats: Understanding the threats goes a long way toward making 
more informed decisions and keeping yourself secure. The past decade has ushered in considerable 

changes in the Microsoft threat landscape, and with the rapid development and deployment of AI 

technologies, we are likely to see many impactful shifts in threats over the next decade and beyond.

CELEBRATING 10 YEARS

What have we learned after a decade of Microsoft vulnerability analysis?

Conclusion

We have learned that, just like 
death and taxes, vulnerabilities 
(at least where software is 
concerned) are inevitable. 

As the technology landscape 
continues its next phase of 
evolution, vulnerability numbers 
should continue to climb, new 
threats will continue to crawl 
out from the cyber\-ether, and 
we’ll continue to offer our 
insights and defense tactics. 

In 2022, the total number of Microsoft vulnerabilities hit a 

record\-high, almost quadrupling since this report began a 

decade ago. Microsoft Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities 

have soared 650% across the past ten years. Over that time, 

new Microsoft products have driven the overall increase 

in total vulnerabilities, with Azure and Dynamics 365 

vulnerabilities climbing by 159% this last year alone.

While total Microsoft vulnerabilities continue to spike—

symptomatic of a growing enterprise and its expanding 

attack surface—Microsoft’s threat reduction initiatives and 

dedication to the adoption of security patches and protocols 

has led to a steady, 5\-year decline of critical vulnerabilities. 

In 2022, only 6\.9% of Microsoft vulnerabilities were rated as 

‘critical’, compared to 44% in 2013\.

Roughly a decade ago (2014\), Microsoft embarked on a 

mobile\-first, cloud\-first strategy. At the time, this strategy 

represented a shift, but today, these are foundations of 
Microsoft, and, increasingly, enterprises around the world. In 

the decade ahead, technologies once considered speculative, 

such as AI, will actively be honed, productized, and embedded 

across Microsoft and everywhere. While there is much 

promise in these technologies to help both organizations and 

humanity, they represent new attack surfaces and potential 

threat vectors. Vulnerabilities may emerge in ways that have 

never been seen before.

41

2023 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary Edition

If there’s one beacon of light shining across the 
past ten years of vulnerabilities, it’s the fact that 
the fundamental ways to mitigate those risks have 
remained constant for well over a decade.

The concepts of least privilege outlined by the US Department of Defense in 1985 are timeless. Least privilege 

enforcement has proved just as relevant to the cloud systems and IoT devices of today, as it did to the legacy 

systems (some of which are still operational) of yester\-year.

Those organizations who successfully implement proactive and preventative security controls will continue 
to be much better poised to withstand tomorrow’s threats, as they have been in the past decade. If there is 
one piece of advice you can take away from this report to help you secure your organization against unrelenting 

cyberthreats, it’s to keep implementing and enforcing the foundational security controls that have proven 

themselves time and again against the decade’s greatest threats.

Methodology

Every Tuesday, Microsoft issues “Patch Tuesday” and releases 
security bulletins announcing fixes for any vulnerabilities affecting 
Microsoft products. The BeyondTrust Microsoft Vulnerabilities 
Report, produced annually, compiles these releases into a year\-long 
overview and analyzes the data, creating a holistic view of trends 
related to vulnerabilities.

Until November 2020, Microsoft had been using their own method 
of sharing CVE details via their Security Update Guide. 

The former reporting format featured an executive summary 
for each reported vulnerability that would include the following 
verbiage:
• Customers/users whose accounts are configured to have fewer 

user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who 
operate with administrative user rights.
If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an 
attacker could take control of an affected system.

• 

From this summary, security researchers could deduce whether any 
given vulnerability (specifically, the Critical ones) could have been 
mitigated had admin rights been removed from the user. 

In 2021, however, Microsoft shifted methodologies and moved 
to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In 2022, 
Microsoft continued to use CVSS 3\.1 scoring for their vulnerabilities, 
but began ranking severities based on Microsoft’s own Security 
Update Severity Rating System. 

The CVSS methodology allows Microsoft’s vulnerabilities to be 
cross\-referenced more easily with third\-party bugs, simplifying 

some analysis, and Microsoft’s Security Update Severity Rating 
System allows each vulnerability to be rated according to the 
worst theoretical outcome, should that vulnerability be exploited.

An unfortunate trade\-off of this change, however, was the loss 
of the ability to determine the impact of admin rights on critical 
vulnerabilities.

Not only do the risks of excess privileged access remain very much 
intact, but privileged attack vectors are rapidly growing with the 
expansion of the cloud.

Thus, while the statistics on admin rights may be absent from 
this year’s report, it’s imperative that organizations don’t get 
complacent. Removal of admin rights remains a key piece of 
applying a least privilege strategy, as well as for enabling zero trust.

Accuracy of Vulnerability Data

A number of generalizations have been made for each 
vulnerability, as follows:
• Each vulnerability was classified with the highest severity rating 

of all instances of that vulnerability where it appeared 
multiple times.

• Each vulnerability was classified with the most prevalent type 

for all instances of that vulnerability.

• Product versions were not taken into account.
• Product combinations were not taken into account.
• Vulnerabilities were counted for both the software and version 
where appropriate (for example, a vulnerability for Microsoft 
Edge on Windows 10 is taken as a vulnerability for both 
Microsoft Edge and Windows).
