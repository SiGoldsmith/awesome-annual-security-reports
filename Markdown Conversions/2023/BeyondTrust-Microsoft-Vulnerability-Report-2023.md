However, it’s not just the number
of vulnerabilities that should be of
concern, but also the unique threat
and impact posed by individual
vulnerabilities.
The Elevation of Privilege category dominates the
Microsoft vulnerability landscape for the third year in a row
and continues its rise.
Microsoft Azure and Dynamics 365 are not only generating
the biggest financial gains for Microsoft; they are also
propelling the biggest gains in number of vulnerabilities.

While the total number of
vulnerabilities is an important
metric for gauging the health of
an environment, as we will cover
in this report, vulnerabilities are
not created equal.
## Understanding Microsoft Critical Vulnerabilities
Some vulnerabilities may pose mostly theoretical risk (low likelihood) and low
impact if they are exploited, while on the opposite side of the spectrum, other
vulnerabilities have high likelihoods of exploitation, and their exploitation may
result in a highly negative impact to the affected organization(s).
Measurement of a vulnerability’s impact will relate to its impact
to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data within
a system or organization. The most severe vulnerabilities will
impact all three of these basic tenets of information security.
Vulnerabilities categorized as ‘critical’ are those with
characteristics that make their exploitation a potentially high-
impact security event.
The way Microsoft classifies the severity rating for a
vulnerability is distinct from the likelihood of exploitation.
However, the likelihood of exploitation is far more dynamic as,
generally speaking, attackers are far more likely to exploit a
known vulnerability.
Exploitation of ‘critical’
vulnerabilities will:
Likely result in total compromise
of a device or infrastructure.
Have fewer prerequisites. Usually,
the attack would not require
any special access, privileges, or
advanced knowledge.
Allow code execution without
user interaction. These generally
do not rely on a user being
socially-engineered.
These are the types of vulnerabilities that keep
IT admins awake at night and pose the most risk
and challenges to businesses.
The National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD) classifies critical vulnerabilities as those given a
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score of 9.0 - 10.0. The more enthusiastic readers of
Microsoft’s vulnerability announcements may have noticed that, while Microsoft now uses CVSS
3.1 scoring for their vulnerabilities, they rank severities based on Microsoft’s own Security Update
Severity Rating System. This rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome,
should that vulnerability be exploited.
2023   |    Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary Edition

How does Microsoft classify
critical vulnerabilities?
This means that, while only 22 Microsoft
vulnerabilities from 2022 scored a nine or
above (making them “critical” under the
National Vulnerability Database scoring
system), Microsoft has classified 89 of its
vulnerabilities as critical.
Rating
Description
Critical
A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution without user interaction. These scenarios include
self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs
without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email. Microsoft recommends that
customers apply Critical updates immediately.
Important
A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data,
or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where a client
is compromised with warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt’s provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of
user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered. Microsoft recommends that customers apply
Important updates at the earliest opportunity.
Moderate
Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or
applicability only to non-default configurations. Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the
security update.
Low
Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft
recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems.
Microsoft’s severity rating system may offer better insights for prioritization of risk reduction.

For example, whether a vulnerability results in some loss of data confidentiality or total loss of
confidentiality. CVSS scoring does not measure the risk of that vulnerability. This means CVSS scores
alone cannot tell you whether a vulnerability will cause a mission-critical impact on a system, or if the
limited loss of some highly sensitive data would have a more severe impact than the total loss of non-
sensitive data.
Microsoft’s severity rating system is potentially far more useful than a base or temporal CVSS score
for security practitioners trying to prioritize risk reduction. However, it is important to know your own
environment and risks so you can understand how best to prioritize patches and/or use other security
hardening controls and mitigations.
All of the data provided by Microsoft’s severity rating system is based on the information that
was available at the time, and lacks the context of your own organization’s threat models. What is
considered a critical patch for one organization may not be so for another organization—it all depends
on the business context.
In addition to their Security Update Severity Rating System, Microsoft also published an Exploitability
Index to help customers understand the likelihood of exploitation. This can be useful information
for those needing help with prioritization of security updates. As a word of caution, this information
reflects the likelihood of exploitation at the time the security update was published. It may not reflect
the real-world exploitability that develops in the following weeks or months as more threat actors
weaponize the vulnerability. The index is best used for very short-term prioritization of updates rather
than as a justification to significantly delay patching.
2023   |    Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary Edition

The difference between CVSS scoring and Microsoft’s severity
rating system is worth noting, not only when considering the data
in this report, but also when considering risk in your organization.
CVSS scores measure the technical severity of a vulnerability.

## Report Retrospective
A Ten-Year
Summary
Here’s how this year’s Microsoft vulnerability
findings align to the 10-year trends.
![Graph showing Total Number of Microsoft Vulnerabilities from 2013 to 2022]
Total number of Microsoft vulnerabilities
hit an all-time high, but are they levelling
out over the long-term?
2022 set a new high for the number of Microsoft vulnerabilities, edging ahead of the previous highwater
mark set in 2020 by 2%. However, if we look at the longer-term trend, we can see that the number of
vulnerabilities appears to be plateauing a little after years of significant growth.
Why are we seeing this pattern? To quote The Notorious B.I.G., “Mo Money Mo Problems,” and this
appears to be very much the case for Microsoft. To increase their revenue, they create new products and
improve existing ones. At the same time, these new offerings potentially increase the attack surface by
providing new code.
In addition, the more customers you have, the more people are looking at your software—from internal
research teams to external pen testers, as well as ill-bent nation states and cyber criminals.

![Graph showing Microsoft’s Annual Revenue Worldwide from FY 2002 to FY 2022 (in Billion USD)]
![Graph showing Microsoft’s Annual Revenue Worldwide vs. Total Vulnerabilities (2013-2022)]
Microsoft’s total revenue and total vulnerabilities both
doubled between 2017 and 2020
So, does “Mo Money” really cause “Mo Problems?” While this isn’t an exact measure, if we look at Microsoft’s
total revenue from 2013 to 2022 and compare that with the total number of Microsoft vulnerabilities, we can see
a similar trend, with both revenue and vulnerabilities almost doubling between 2017 and 2020.
Moreover, if we drill down into the product areas with the biggest growth, we see Microsoft Azure and
Dynamics 365 not only making the biggest financial gains for the company (cloud revenue accounted for 51.4%
of Microsoft’s total revenue in 2022), but also representing the largest gain in vulnerabilities, as represented by
both the increase in number of vulnerabilities (70) and the percentage increased (159%) in 2022.
2023   |    Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary Edition

The number of critical Microsoft
vulnerabilities reached their lowest point
across the 10 years of this report.
Critical Microsoft vulnerabilities dropped
55% since 2020, indicating a decrease in
the overall level of risk associated with
individual vulnerabilities.
In this 10th year of the Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report, we saw two records set
for vulnerabilities that seem to highlight opposing trends. While the total number of
Microsoft vulnerabilities reached its highest recorded number in 2022, the number of critical
vulnerabilities hit their lowest number, with less than half the number of critical vulnerabilities
appearing in 2022 than we saw in 2020. In 2022, only 6.9% of Microsoft’s vulnerabilities were
rated as ‘critical,’ while in 2013, a substantial 44% of all Microsoft vulnerabilities were classified
as ‘critical.’
This trend indicates that, while overall vulnerabilities have increased in number, the risks and
worst-case scenarios associated with these individual vulnerabilities have decreased from
previous years. This also indicates that, while the overall Microsoft attack surface is expanding
along with the expansion of Microsoft’s business, the organization is doing a better job at
minimizing the most dangerous types of development errors.
Microsoft has made significant investments in security improvements over the years, and we
believe this is reflected in the downward trend in the number of critical Microsoft vulnerabilities.
Many of Microsoft’s products have had a very long tail of support, which means these security
improvements are happening as organizations transition to more up-to-date and secure
products, as well as to more SaaS instances, where everyone is kept on the latest version.
As critical vulnerabilities become scarcer, attackers may need to chain
multiple, less severe exploits together to gain code execution, elevate
privileges, and move around the network.
From a defender’s point of view, this is a good thing because it requires
a higher level of attacker skill and reduces the number of possible
adversaries. It also provides more potential points to detect, intercept,
and mitigate a breach.
If an attacker needs to chain three or more vulnerabilities together to
reach their objective, then you just need to have mitigated or patched
one of them to break the chain.

Remote Code Execution and
Elevation of Privilege remain the
top vulnerability categories.
## Vulnerabilities Data Deep-Dive
### Vulnerabilities by Category
Each Microsoft Security Bulletin is comprised of one or more vulnerabilities,
applying to one or more Microsoft products. Microsoft typically groups
vulnerabilities into these main categories: Remote Code Execution (RCE),
Elevation of Privilege (EoP), Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS),
Spoofing, Tampering, and Security Feature Bypass.
In 2022, Elevation of Privilege and Remote Code Execution continued
to tower over the other vulnerability categories.
With that aside, Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities continue their
strong growth trajectory, while Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities
have been declining slightly over the past three years.
Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities
skyrocketed to 715 in 2022, a 22% increase
over 2021, and a whopping 689% increase
since 2017.
Remote Code Execution continued its slight
downward trend following its 2020 peak,
declining 4% in 2022 after falling 5.5% in 2021.

![Graph showing Microsoft Vulnerability Categories from 2013 to 2022]
2023   |    Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary Edition

![Graph showing Breakdown of Microsoft Vulnerability Categories (2022)]
### What are the vulnerability categories telling us?
Vulnerability levels may be changing, but hackers’ objectives
remain the same, keeping emphasis on Remote Code Execution
and Elevation of Privilege.
As we discussed above, having fewer critical vulnerabilities means attackers have fewer easy paths to totally
compromise a system in one move. This is good news for organizations; however, an attacker’s objective
remains unchanged: they want to get their code to run, and they want it to be able to run with enough
privileges that they can execute their malicious intent.
To achieve this objective, attackers need to have Remote Code Execution, the ability to launch their code on a
target system, and Elevation of Privilege to make sure this code runs with enough privilege. This is reflected in
the finding that Remote Code Execution and Elevation of Privilege remain the highest Microsoft vulnerability
categories, as highlighted in this report. In particular, the number of Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities
across the Microsoft environment has been on a steep upward trajectory over the past three years.
The data from this report reflects that, as of 2022, Microsoft is making continued progress at reducing the
number of critical vulnerabilities and removing excessive privileges, especially on endpoints. This is driving
the need for attackers to exploit Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities to succeed.
2023   |    Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary Edition

### 2 Key Security Takeaways from the Vulnerability Category Data
1. Always ensure your operating system and third-party software are up-to-date and you are not using end-of-life software in your environment.
2. Always ensure you are removing excessive privileges, especially on endpoints.

Unsurprisingly, the SANS Institute’s CIS Controls, the Australian Cyber Security Centre
(ACSC)’s Essential 8 Cyber Risk Controls, and NIST’s (SP 800-207) Zero Trust Architecture
also highlight these as essential cybersecurity controls for threat prevention and mitigation.
See our section on “Mitigating Microsoft-Based Vulnerability Risks” at the end of this report
for more in-depth insights.

### Vulnerabilities by Product
![Graph showing Vulnerabilities by Product from 2017 to 2022]
![Graph showing Critical Vulnerabilities by Product from 2017 to 2022]
After a nearly four-fold spike
in 2021, Microsoft Edge total
vulnerabilities decreased by
11%, to 311 vulnerabilities in
2022; critical vulnerabilities
continue to plummet
2023   |    Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary Edition

Those who are not familiar with what happened under the hood of Edge in recent years may be wondering
what on Earth happened in 2020, when critical vulnerabilities suddenly plummeted and total vulnerabilities
rocketed. This was when Microsoft ditched their own in-house browser engine and rebuilt Edge around
Chromium. The benefits of this move were that, going forward, Microsoft could leverage the more mature
and open source Chromium engine to resolve their critical vulnerability challenges, as well as a range of
compatibility issues that often drove customers to only use Edge once—to download the Chrome installer.
The Chromium project benefits from being open source and ubiquitous enough to attract a lot of focus from
the security research community. This focus has allowed it to rapidly mature. While other browsers may have
a lower overall vulnerability count than Edge (or Chrome), this does not necessarily make them more secure.
The Edge vulnerability trends are a good example of what happens when there is no easy path for an attacker.
A critical vulnerability in a browser may allow an attacker to gain privileged execution on a system just by
having the victim click a malicious link. However, with no easy path, attackers are forced to string together
multiple less severe vulnerabilities to get from point A to point B.
![Graph showing Microsoft Edge Vulnerabilities from 2017 to 2022]
2017-2021 includes Internet Explorer, which was discontinued
last year. 2022 figures are for Edge only.
Windows critical
vulnerabilities continue
to trend downwards,
following Windows 7
EOL and the shift to
virtualization-based-
security (VBS).
2023   |    Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary Edition

In 2020, the end of Windows 7 support forced users to upgrade to the Windows 10 operating
system, eliminating many known vulnerabilities. This accounted for the steep, 44% drop in the
number of Microsoft Windows vulnerabilities from 2020 to 2021.
Windows 10 has been around since 2015, and Windows 11, while only launched in 2021, shares
the same core as Windows 10. This means the OS is less likely to introduce any major new
vulnerabilities. Moreover, some security issues have been addressed by using virtualization-
based security (VBS). VBS isolates untrusted websites and Office documents from the user
data and protects key areas, such as credential stores, by providing hardware-level isolation and
preventing pass-the-hash type attacks. This helps ensure protection even in the event the OS is
compromised.
While Windows total vulnerabilities increased slightly in 2022 (returning to near 2018 levels),
Windows critical vulnerabilities have continued a downward trend since these changes came
into play. We expect an overall downward trend to continue, although progress will come in small
increments because there remains a lot of legacy code.
![Graph showing Microsoft Windows Vulnerabilities from 2017 to 2022]
The Microsoft Office Suite
has matured extensively
over the past few years,
driving down vulnerabilities
and cutting off attack
vectors, but the road to
remediation has been a
bumpy one in 2022.
2023   |    Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary Edition

The Microsoft Office products category experienced a 45% drop in vulnerabilities in 2022,
while critical vulnerabilities increased from a low of one in 2021 to two instances in 2022.
While there is an overarching downward trend in the number of Microsoft Office vulnerabilities that
stretches back five years, Office applications have remained a successful target for threat actors.
This is largely due to the lag times between discovery and patching, as demonstrated by CVE-2022-
30190 and CVE-2022-34713, both detailed below.
Along with patching vulnerabilities, Microsoft has been pushing to cut off common attack vectors,
such as VBA macros in documents, that have been delivered from the internet. This is an extremely
common attack vector, but previous mitigation attempts have merely been soft blocks that are easily
circumvented by socially engineering the end user into enabling macros.
In 2022, Microsoft stepped up defenses against this attack vector by blocking internet macros by
default in Office applications. The block did not go as smoothly as planned. Microsoft announced
the move in February, rolled it out in April, and temporarily rolled back the decision before
communicating another update about blocking VBA macros by default in the summer—after
receiving user feedback. This caused considerable confusion.
So, while we have seen the trends around Microsoft Office vulnerabilities moving in the right
direction, the road to remediation has been bumpy in 2022. Hopefully, moving forward, we will see
a condensing of the lag times between discovery and patching.

The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVE) system provides
a reference method for publicly
known information-security
vulnerabilities and exposures.
### Microsoft Office Vulnerabilities Spotlight
#### The Follina Exploit and CVE-2022-30190
CVSS base score of 7.8 and temporal score of 7.0
While you can never pick a favorite vulnerability, the “Follina” exploit that led to Office vulnerability CVE-2022-
30190 certainly was memorable. This was a zero-day exploit that allowed for Remote Code Execution in Office
products. Notably, it leveraged the Microsoft Office protocol and MSDT, a Microsoft support tool used to allow
code to run, even if macros were disabled or when the user simply opened a preview of the file. Follina was
quickly exploited by threat actors in various attack campaigns.
The timeline and response to this vulnerability was particularly interesting. As early as 2021, researchers raised
the issue of abusing Office protocols; however, it was initially dismissed as a non-issue. Over April and May
of 2022, we began to see reports of these techniques being used in the wild. Other reports were submitted to
Microsoft, yet no CVE appeared until May 30th. Finally, on the 14th of June, a patch was released. However, by
this point, Qakbot and various other threat actors were actively exploiting the vulnerability.

2023   |    Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 10th Anniversary Edition

#### DogWalk and CVE-2022-34713
CVSS base score of 7.8 and temporal score of 7.2
Related to Follina, DogWalk (CVE-2022–34713) also exploited the Microsoft support tool MSDT. DogWalk
was first reported to Microsoft in late 2019, but Microsoft initially took a dismissive stance toward the
potential impact and significance of the vulnerability. This was surprising, given that the vulnerability
allowed an attacker to gain code execution by dropping an executable file into a Windows start-up folder
when the victim opened a diagcab file.
Because browsers did not view diagcab files as a threat, it made it possible to perform a drive-by-download
and trigger the exploit just by visiting a malicious website. In turn, it also provided a way to bypass the
“Mark of the web,” where files are marked as coming from the internet and, therefore, treated with a
lower degree of trust (something that many security solutions monitor). Finally, DogWalk provided a
straightforward way to gain both execution and persistence by launching payloads on start-up.
Only after reports surfaced of the DogWalk zero-day being exploited in the wild, combined with fresh news
of the Follina vulnerability, did Microsoft make a U-turn. In August of 2022, Microsoft decided this was a
vulnerability to patch and released a security update.
.
What can we learn from DogWalk and
Follina? The importance of proactively
recognizing and mitigating vulnerabilities.
While DogWalk was not strictly an Office vulnerability,
it’s worth highlighting alongside Follina because they
both tell a story of the confusion that is caused when
researchers disclose vulnerabilities, Microsoft initially
dismisses the findings, and customers become
caught in the middle.
The lines between vulnerabilities, bugs, and
‘working as intended’ can become very blurred.
Often, the discovery of these kinds of issues just
scratches the surface of a much larger issue.
When Microsoft initially decides something
isn’t a vulnerability, it only causes security
researchers and threat actors to start to pull at
the threads to see what else can be unravelled.
We’ll talk about this more in a later section
on the “vulnerability snowball effect.”
The main challenge here is getting impactful
vulnerabilities recognized as such sooner
and patched faster, rather than relying
on in-the-wild exploits and social media
pressure to drive the process.

While Windows Server
total and critical
vulnerabilities are
on a 4-year decline,
patching coverage
remains a concern.
The Windows Server category experienced a 4% increase in total vulnerabilities year-over-year, while the
number of critical Windows Server vulnerabilities continued its multi-year decline, falling by a noteworthy
23% year-over-year. The number of Windows Server critical vulnerabilities has decreased by an impressive
72% since 2017.
One concern with regard to Windows Server vulnerabilities is the patching coverage. The Shadowserver
Foundation reported that, in late December of 2022, nearly 70,000 Microsoft Exchange Server
implementations were still vulnerable to the ProxyNotShell vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-41040 & CVE-2022-
41082), which were discovered in September of 2022.
As with the Windows Print Spooler vulnerabilities (detailed below), even when patched, ProxyNotShell has
continued to cause issues. In December of 2022, researchers from CrowdStrike discovered “OWASSRF,” a
method for bypassing the mitigations Microsoft had provided. The OWASSRF exploit has been used by a
number of ransomware threat actors, including during the attacks on H-Hotels and Rackspace.
This situation stoked some controversy. For instance, some organizations reportedly held off patching
due to reports of authentication errors that could have caused downtime, and due to concerns that the
patch could be bypassed anyway. These kinds of trade-offs between keeping servers up and running—and
keeping them secure—can induce cold sweats in IT decision-makers.

Microsoft Azure and Dynamics 365 experienced the
largest increase in vulnerabilities of all Microsoft
product categories in 2022, skyrocketing from 44 in
2021 to 114 last year, an increase of 159%.
Given the broad range of products Microsoft Azure and Dynamics 365 now covers, this increase might
not be a huge surprise; however, one particular tool seems to have accounted for the majority of the
vulnerability growth.
