# State of the Phish 2023

## An in-depth exploration of user awareness, vulnerability and resilience

**REPORT**

A COMMISSIONED SURVEY OF:

**7,500** working adults across 15 countries
**1,050** IT security professionals across those counties

AND:

**135 million** simulated phishing attacks sent by our customers over a 12-month period
**18 million** emails reported by our customers’ end users over a 12-month period

## 2022: Cyber Criminals Get Even More Creative

Every year, threat actors look for new ways to outwit victims and bypass defenses. And 2022 was no different. As businesses rolled out new security controls, cyber criminals responded. They scaled-up complex techniques like telephone-oriented attack delivery (TOAD) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) bypass. Unknown to most users, these techniques gave cyber attackers a new advantage. At their peak, TOAD and MFA bypass saw hundreds of thousands of attacks sent per day—ubiquitous enough to threaten most organizations. And at the same time, proven tactics like brand abuse, business email compromise (BEC) and ransomware remained as popular as ever. With threat actors constantly upping their game, CISOs and Infosec teams had their work cut out.

Now in its ninth year, our annual State of the Phish report explores end-user security awareness, resilience and risk across 15 countries (eight more than in previous years). The report benchmarks understanding of common cyber threats and defensive tactics and reveals how potential gaps in knowledge and cyber hygiene enable the real-world attack landscape. Most attacks target people before they target systems. That’s why helping users build sustainable security habits is crucial. So, the last section of the report examines security awareness practices and outlines opportunities to build and reinforce a security-aware culture at every level of an organization.

The report draws on surveys of 7,500 working adults and 1,050 IT security professionals across 15 counties. It also includes findings sourced from 135 million simulated phishing attacks sent by our customers over a 12-month period and more than 18 million emails reported by our customers’ end users over that same time period.

## Security Habits and Knowledge Gaps

Last year’s State of the Phish described 2021 as “the year of the new normal.” The pandemic started to recede, and many workplaces permanently adopted a hybrid model. Those macro trends have continued in 2022, cementing an expanded attack surface that cyber criminals can target both in and out of the office.

The increased risks of a hybrid workplace are well understood by CISOs, and many told us in our 2022 Voice of the CISO report that they planned to take steps to enhance security awareness programs to meet this challenge.

All of which begs the question: has the basic level of security awareness and understanding increased since last year?

Unfortunately, the short answer is “no.”

### Terms and concepts: the same gaps remain

Common threats are still not well understood across organizations. Nearly a third of survey participants were unable to correctly define terms like “phishing” and “malware.” For more advanced attacks like “ransomware,” “smishing” (SMS phishing) and “vishing” (voice phishing) around two-thirds answered incorrectly.

Data from the past four years shows only modest gains or no gains at all.

**End-User Understanding Shows Little Change from Year to Year**

| Term        | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |
| ----------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Vishing      | 29%  | 23%  | 24%  | 25%  |
| Smishing     | 30%  | 24%  | 23%  | 25%  |
| Malware      | 63%  | 61%  | 66%  | 63%  |
| Ransomware   | 40%  | 36%  | 31%  | 31%  |
| Phishing     | 58%  | 53%  | 65%  | 61%  |

**COMING TO TERMS:**

Even basic concepts are still not fully understood—more than a third can’t define “malware,” “phishing” and “ransomware”

**40%** of users know what ransomware is, a 9-point jump from 2019—the biggest increase among the terms we asked about
**29% and 30%** of users knew the relatively new terms smishing and vishing, respectively
**58%** of users knew what phishing is, a 5-point increase from last year but 3 points below 2019

Moving on from terminology to security fundamentals, the story is more encouraging. Some 80% to 90% of respondents said they understood basic email security concepts. Numbers here have increased by 2 to 3 percentage points year over year.

| Concept                                                              | % Aware |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| know to be cautious of unexpected emails                             | 89%     |
| know a familiar company brand doesn’t make an email safe             | 56%     |
| know that files stored in the cloud are not always safe              | 39%     |
| know email attachments can have damaging software                   | 84%     |
| know a link or attachment can affect computers beyond theirs         | 51%     |
| know internal emails at work are not always safe                     | 38%     |
| know an email can appear to come from someone other than the sender | 79%     |
| know their email provider can’t automatically block all malicious emails| 42%     |
| know an email link might not match the website it goes to            | 37%     |
| know exchanging multiple emails doesn’t mean a sender is safe        | 42%     |
| know their company can’t automatically block all malicious emails     | 32%     |

We saw a similar degree of improvement for more advanced email security concepts, though overall understanding was lower at just 40% to 50%. Notably, people have become more aware that cyber criminals can send multiple emails to build trust. This evolution of this tactic has been a point of focus for our threat researchers this year, particularly with state-sponsored attacks.

**IMPOSTER SYNDROME:**

**21%** of users don’t know that an email can appear to be from someone other than the sender
**44%** of users don’t know that a familiar brand doesn’t make the email safe
**63%** of users don’t know that an email link text might not match the website it goes to

**THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE:**

Nearly 30% of respondents said that they weren’t sure if files stored in the cloud are always safe. This was by far the highest percentage of “not sure” answers; others ranged between 8% and 20%. In security terms, “not sure” and “don’t know” both describe a knowledge gap. Instead of just focusing on incorrect answers, training programs should also aim to address blind spots.

### Security habits: blurred lines

In the last four years of tracking security habits both at home and at work, we’ve seen a noticeable shift. It’s now the case that over three-quarters of people use their work devices for personal activities, with almost the same proportion using personal devices for work.

**78%** use work devices for personal activities
**72%** use personal devices for work devices
**48%** let family and friends use their work devices

Personal use of work devices for social media and online shopping held steady from year to year. However, email, messaging and reading news all increased.

**Personal Use of Work Devices**

| Activity          | 2022 | 2021 |
|-------------------|------|------|
| Emails and messages | 42%  | 28%  |
| Shop online       | 29%  | 32%  |
| Read news         | 40%  | 29%  |
| Social media      | 32%  | 32%  |

Nearly half of respondents said they allowed friends and family to use their work devices. This number has fallen slightly year on year (from 56% to 48%), possibly because of people returning to offices for more days during the week. Most categories of use by friends and family remained static year on year, with email and messaging the most common activities.

**Friends & Family Use of Their Work Devices**

| Activity          | 2022 | 2021 |
|-------------------|------|------|
| Emails & messages | 24%  | 24%  |
| Shop online       | 19%  | 20%  |
| Read news         | 23%  | 24%  |
| Social media      | 21%  | 24%  |

Unfortunately, a small percentage of respondents (3%) said they didn’t know what their friends or family did on their work device. This clearly represents an unacceptable level of risk.

### Security habits: password hygiene

Another area where behavior has remained disappointingly unchanged is password management.

The most common method is the most secure: using a single unique password, entered manually per account. In second and third place, less-secure browser password managers are still more popular than dedicated apps. While the least secure options are to be found in the long tail of responses, more than a quarter of respondents admitted to reusing a limited number of passwords.

**Use of Home and Work Passwords**

| Method                               | 2022 Work | 2022 Personal |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|
| Manually enter unique password for every account | 31%       | 30%           |
| Save login information in browser    | 27%       | 26%           |
| Use password manager app             | 18%       | 17%           |
| Manually rotate 1-4 passwords        | 16%       | 14%           |
| Manually rotate 5-10 passwords       | 6%        | 6%            |
| Manually rotate over 10 passwords     | 6%        | 6%            |

**PASSWORD UNPROTECTED:**

**28%** of users reuse passwords for multiple work-related accounts, jeopardizing all of them if even just one is compromised

### Security habits: Wi-Fi woes

Password problems aren’t just limited to email and cloud accounts. We also found that numbers are low when it comes to Wi-Fi password best practices.

Over two-thirds of people password protect their home network. But the number of people who change default wireless and administration passwords is much lower, at less than a third each. Most alarming of all, 7% of respondents said they took no home Wi-Fi security measures at all.

**Percentage of Actions to Protect Home Wi-Fi**

| Action                         | 2022 | 2021 |
|--------------------------------|------|------|
| Password protect the network   | 69%  | 60%  |
| Change default network name    | 26%  | 26%  |
| Change default network password| 29%  | 25%  |
| Change default admin password  | 20%  | 21%  |
| Check router software updates  | 21%  | 18%  |
| Don’t take any security measures| 7%   | 11%  |

**WIRELESS WEAKNESSES:**

**71%** of users don’t change the default network name on work WI-Fi routers
**80%** of home and work Wi-Fi users didn’t change the default admin password for their routers in 2022—worse than the previous year

As part of our survey, we asked people why they don’t take these necessary steps to secure their home networks. The range of answers is revealing:

*   Feel security is already in place (“That’s what my network provider does.”)
*   Think there is built-in safety (“(I thought it was safe enough.”)
*   Never think about security (“I have never thought to change any of these things.”)
*   Security handled by someone they know (“My spouse looks after this.”)
*   Made security changes previously (“I made changes when it was set up.”)
*   Made some changes but not others (“I have modified the ones I thought appropriate.”)
*   Don’t know how to change settings (“I was worried I would mess it up.”)

### Security habits: risky business

With these gaps in knowledge and best practices, it’s no surprise that many people continue to take risky actions when faced with a cyber attack. And with many risky actions not being recognized in the moment (or admitted to after the fact), these numbers are almost certainly lower than the reality.

More than a third of respondents took at least one risky action during the year, with clicking on malicious links being the most frequent. With email overwhelmingly the most common vector for distributing phishing links and malware, training users on the correct action to take should remain a key part of ongoing security awareness initiatives.

**Risky Actions Taken by Working Adults in Threat Situations**

| Action                                  | %   |
|-----------------------------------------|-----|
| Any type of risk action                 | 34% |
| Clicked phishing link to fake website   | 18% |
| Downloaded malware from smish           | 13% |
| Downloaded malware from phishing link/site| 11% |
| Gave personal information to a scammer  | 9%  |
| Gave password to untrustworthy source    | 8%  |

**ACTIONS SPEAK VOLUMES:**

**34%** of users did something in 2022 that put themselves or their organizations at risk
**63%** of working adults think an email link always goes to the matching website brand
**11%** of recipients fell for phishing simulations mentioning “DocuSign document for review” and “FedEx delivery failure”

## Recognize Risk

Cyber criminals know that most people have gaps in their security awareness. Their own campaign dashboards provide the evidence, with phishing kits, botnets and malware-as-a-service often showing click rates, downloads and other common digital “success” metrics.

Despite many techniques remaining effective, attackers aren’t standing still. They have refined their social engineering tactics and introduced entirely novel attacks. When the threat landscape moves this quickly, security teams—and security awareness programs—need to be agile to keep up.

The incidence of most attack types has remained constant year on year, with high levels across the board. Threats arrive at an unrelenting pace and are almost as likely to appear from inside an organization as from an external attacker.

In total, 84% of survey respondents said that their organization had experienced at least one successful email-based phishing attack during 2022. And 54% said that they had dealt with three or more attacks.

**Prevalence of Attacks**

| Attack Type         | 2022 | 2021 |
|---------------------|------|------|
| Bulk Phishing       | 66%  | 68%  |
| Spear Phishing      | 69%  | 74%  |
| BEC                 | 74%  | 65%  |
| Ransomware          | 64%  | 76%  |
| Smishing            | 75%  | 71%  |
| Vishing             | 69%  | 76%  |
| USB Drop            | 78%  | 75%  |
| Social Media        | 77%  | 74%  |
| Supply Chain*       | 79%  | -    |
| Data Loss: External*| 85%  | -    |
| Data Loss: Insider* | 86%  | -    |

*New question for 2023 report

**84%** of organizations faced at least one successful phishing attack
**54%** faced three or more attacks

### TOADs and MFA phishing

This year, telephone-oriented attack delivery (TOAD) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) phishing have made waves in the threat landscape. In a TOAD attack, targets receive a message, often containing a fake invoice or alert. The message also contains a customer service number for anyone with questions. If the victim calls the number, they find themselves on the line with a cyber attacker. Our researchers have seen a range of next steps, including guiding victims to download malware, transfer money or enable remote access. At peak, we see over 600,000 TOAD messages sent per day, and the number has been steadily rising since the technique first appeared in 2021.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) uses a second “factor” such as a phone or hardware key for added security when logging in to digital accounts. Enabling it is still a security best practice, but cyber attackers now have a range of methods to bypass MFA. While these are technically sophisticated attacks, some phishing-as-a-service providers already include MFA bypass in their off-the-shelf phishing kits.

### Brand abuse

Social engineering is integral to most cyber attacks. Using psychological manipulation, threat actors unsettle victims into making mistakes, ignoring warning signs or trusting malicious messages.

Social engineering’s power comes from the fact that people often rely on mental shortcuts when making decisions. One of the clearest examples of social engineering is brand abuse. In these attacks, cyber criminals benefit from users’ familiarity—and trust—of well-known brands. The most obvious way to take advantage of a brand is to use their logo or styling in a malicious message. But it’s also worth considering that in the digital workplace, malicious links hosted on cloud storage solutions like Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive and Dropbox are also likely to benefit from positive brand associations, as are malicious files created with familiar Microsoft 365 software.

**SIMULATING REALITY:**

Microsoft was also the most common brand template used by our customers in phishing simulations. Half of the ten most-used templates were brand-abuse related. And templates featuring familiar brands tended to have high failure rates.

In 2022, we observed nearly 1,600 campaigns that involved brand abuse, and the most abused brand in our data was Microsoft. During the year, we saw over 30 million messages that used Microsoft branding or featured a Microsoft product like Office or OneDrive.

Perhaps not suprisingly, half of the 10 most-used templates by our customers in phishing simulations were brand-abuse related. Templates featuring familiar brands tended to have high failure rates.

Notably, 44% of working adults in our survey said that they think an email is safe when it contains familiar branding. And Microsoft isn’t the only brand experiencing regular abuse, with Amazon (6.5 million messages), DocuSign (3.6 million messages), Google (2.6 million messages), DHL (2 million messages) and Adobe (1.5 million messages) all regularly impersonated.

**Cyber Attack Messages that Involved Brand Abuse in 2022**

| Brand     | Messages |
|-----------|----------|
| Microsoft | 30M      |
| Amazon    | 6.5M     |
| DocuSign  | 3.6M     |
| Google    | 2.6M     |
| DHL       | 2M       |
| Adobe     | 1.5M     |

### BEC Goes Global

In our recent Cybersecurity: The 2022 Board Perspective report, global board members rated business email compromise (BEC) as their top concern. English is the most common language used in BEC attacks, but some non-English-speaking countries are starting to see higher volumes of attacks in their own languages. Year over year, we’ve seen growth in the following countries:

| Country        | Increase |
|----------------|----------|
| Spain          | up 13 points |
| Germany        | up 11 points |
| Sweden         | up 5 points  |
| France         | (no prior analysis) |
| The Netherlands| (no prior analysis) |

Globally, the average incidence of attempted BEC is 75%, and some countries do still fall well below this level. Japan (52%), Italy (51%), Brazil (56%), Korea (58%) and UAE (66%) all have BEC rates below that average. While the reason for these countries seeing fewer BEC attacks is unclear, there may be cultural, linguistic or logistical challenges that prevent attackers from effectively targeting and monetizing them. Or some organizations may lack visibility into the true number of attacks they’re facing.

Board members across the globe rate BEC as their top concern (41%), followed by cloud account compromise (37%) and ransomware (32%), according to our Cybersecurity: The 2022 Board Perspective report.

### Ransomware remains

BEC might be the most lucrative form of cyber attack, but ransomware can inflict massive operational, reputational and financial damage. About 76% of organizations experienced an attempted ransomware attack, with 64% experiencing a successful infection. Alarmingly, over two-thirds of respondents said their organizations experienced multiple separate incidents of infection. The FBI’s latest Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) report shows that ransomware attacks have continued to rise, increasing by 51% year over year. The Bureau recommends that organizations refrain from paying, as this only contributes to the threat’s growth.

There is also no guarantee that payment will result in a positive outcome. About 52% of victims—slightly better odds than a coin flip—regained access to their data after making a single ransomware payment. Nearly as many were obliged to make further payments, and some still never regained access to their data. Still, most infected organizations paid up, and many did so more than once—usually with the help of cyber insurance.

The overwhelming majority of organizations that faced a ransomware attack had cyber insurance (90%), and most of those insurers were willing to help (82%). This perhaps explains the high propensity to pay, with 64% of organizations infected with ransomware paying at least one ransom—a six-point increase from last year.

**Ransomware by the Numbers**

**64%** of orgs were infected by ransomware in 2022
**90%** of organizations that were infected by ransomware had cyber insurance
**99%** of ransomware victims in the U.S. had cyber insurance, the highest percentage among countries surveyed

**Ransomware Infections: What Happens After Payment**

| Outcome                                                               | %   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| Regained access to data after first payment                            | 52% |
| Paid additional ransom demand(s) and eventually regained access        | 41% |
| Refused to pay additional ransom demand(s) and walked away without data| 6%  |
| Never got access to data even after paying ransom(s)                   | 1%  |

**64%** of infected organizations agreed to pay ransom in 2022. Up 6% from 2021

Some 41% said they paid more than one ransom before regaining access to their data. The majority of companies taking out cyber insurance (73%) said that their insurer covered some or all the losses incurred.

**Cyber Insurance Role**

| Coverage                               | %   |
|----------------------------------------|-----|
| Insurer covered ALL loses              | 34% |
| Insurer covered PARTIAL losses         | 39% |
| Insurer DENIED the claim               | 7%  |
| Ransomware attacks were not covered by our insurer | 9%  |
| Don’t have cyber insurance             | 7%  |
| Not sure                               | 4%  |

**27%** of infected organizations absorbed all losses to ranswomware attacks

### The insider threat

According to 1,400 global CISOs surveyed in our 2022 Voice of the CISO report, insider threats are their biggest security concern. And today’s job market has made data protection an even bigger challenge. Pandemic-related job mobility coupled with post-pandemic economic uncertainty has resulted in large numbers of people changing or leaving jobs. And data shows that people often take sensitive data and credentials with them when they go.

In this year’s survey, we asked end users if they had changed jobs within the past two years. A quarter said that they had, and, of those who left their jobs, nearly half admitted to taking data with them when they left.

We also added questions about insider data loss to our survey of security professionals. Nearly 65% reported that their organization had experienced data loss because of an insider. The number was even higher for the U.S., the U.K. and the Netherlands at around 85%.

The most common cause of data loss to insiders is the result of carelessness or negligence. But that isn’t the only type of insider threat. In general, they fall into three main categories:

*   A “careless user” might cause accidental harm, such as a Japanese city contractor who lost a USB stick with the personal data of almost half a million residents.
*   A “malicious user” takes actions for deliberate harm or personal gain, such as an outgoing Pfizer employee who allegedly uploaded over 12,000 confidential files to a Google Drive account.
*   A “compromised user” is enticed by reward or coercion to infiltrate or exfiltrate data, such as a former SoftBank chief accepting ¥400,000 to leak confidential information to a Russian diplomat.

**25%** of users said they had changed jobs within the past two years
**44%** of those who left a job took data with them

| Data Loss Incidents via Insider | %   |
|---------------------------------|-----|
| report one to 10 data loss incident(s) | 25% |
| report 11 to 25 data loss incidents  | 17% |
| report 26 to 50 data loss incidents  | 11% |
| report over 50 data loss incidents   | 11% |

### Counting the cost

For most threat actors, the goal of an attack is financial. And according to our data, 30% of organizations that endured a successful attack experienced a direct monetary loss, such as a fraudulent invoice, wire transfer or payroll redirection. This is an increase of 76% year over year.

The three most common consequences of attack were data breach (44%), ransomware infection (43%) and account compromise (36%). As all three of these actions can be readily monetized by cyber criminals, the financial incentives driving attacks are clear to see.

**Results of Successful Phishing Attacks (Global Average)**

| Consequence                                   | 2022 | 2021 |
|-----------------------------------------------|------|------|
| Breach of customer/client data                | 44%  | 33%  |
| Ransomware infection (the malware was delivered via email) | 43%  | 28%  |
| Credential / account compromise               | 36%  | 27%  |
| Loss of data / intellectual property          | 26%  | 26%  |

## Benchmarks: Failure Rates, Reporting and Resilience

In addition to surveys and threat research, State of the Phish also compiles data from our phishing simulation tool to help identify areas of risk and areas for improvement.

The first headline to note is that users continue to display a major vulnerability to, well, headlines. Trending topics from news or social media are often engaging and can cause people to ignore red flags. Beyond regularly targeting seasonal events like holidays and the tax deadline, threat actors moved quickly to adopt the COVID-19 pandemic as a favored lure subject. Cyber criminals are nimble and opportunistic—so security awareness programs should use real-world threat intelligence and be modelled on real-world lures. Our researchers even saw a campaign making use of the death of Queen Elizabeth II to distribute malware.

### Template failure rates

Attackers are adaptive, so phishing simulations should cover a range of templates and themes to reflect the current landscape. In real-world terms, attacks using unsafe URL links are between three to four times as common as those containing attachments. So the current ratio of link and attachment templates needs rebalancing. Especially as attachments still have an appreciably higher failure rate than links (though this has fallen by 4% since last year).

**PHISHING SIMULATION BY THE NUMBERS:**

**135 million+** simulated phishing attacks sent by our customers in 2022. An increase of 39 million over the 2021 number (96 million).
**~410 million** simulated phishing messages have been sent since we started counting.

**Simulation type and frequency**

| Simulation Type | 2022 Frequency | 2021 Frequency |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Link-based      | 66%            | 65%            |
| Data entry      | 27%            | 26%            |
| Attachment      | 8%             | 9%             |

**Average failure rates**

| Simulation Type | 2022 Failure Rate | 2021 Failure Rate |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Link-based      | 12%               | 11%               |
| Data entry      | 11%               | 4%                |
| Attachment      | 16%               | 20%               |

### Failure rates by industry

Below are the industry average failure rates for phishing simulations. The data is in aggregate and contains all template types. Legal has the lowest overall failure rate, and electronics has the highest.

**FAILURE RATE COMPARISON:**

Each industry represented in our failure rate comparison includes data from at least 20 organizations and at least 300,000 simulated phishing attacks.

### Failure rates by department

Attackers are known to comb LinkedIn and other sources to find targets in departments with access to financial information and intellectual property. So, measuring failure rates by department is crucial to identifying and mitigating that risk.

Among our customers, three-quarters of departments were involved in 474 campaigns, receiving 6,000 messages or more in 2022 with almost 800 different templates. This is a substantial increase over 2021 usage. Unfortunately, the worst-performing functions were some of the most valuable: development, R&D, supply chain, legal and managerial groups shared the highest failure rates. Between them, these groups have access to valuable IP, contracts, invoicing and high-level credentials.

**TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY:**

Development, R&D, supply chain, legal and managerial groups shared the highest failure rates.
