About the Synopsys 2023 DevSecOps 
report 
In early 2023, the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research 
Center (CyRC) and Censuswide, an international market 
research consultancy, conducted a survey of 1,000 IT 
professionals who identified security as part of their 
role or responsibilities. The group includes developers, 
AppSec professionals, DevOps engineers, CISOs, 
and experts who work in various roles in technology, 
cybersecurity, and application/software development. 
Participants came from the U.S., U.K., France, Finland, 
Germany, China, Singapore, and Japan. 

Respondents from all industries and all company sizes 
were eligible to participate. One of the challenges 
faced while developing the survey is that the term 
“DevSecOps” embraces several disciplines, many of 
which have unique personas. The goal was to include a 
broad spectrum of professionals including “hands\-on” 
developers who write the code and people at the CISO 
level, but targeting those whose work involved some 
aspect of software security. 

The majority of the respondents cited their general 
unhappiness with the AST tools they have in use

On DevOps and DevSecOps
Achieving the key tenets of DevOps—accelerated 
development, continuous delivery, pipeline resilience, 
scalability, and end\-to\-end transparency—requires a 
concerted effort from contributors in development, 
security, and operations. 

An extension of the DevOps methodology, DevSecOps 
is designed to instill a culture of security across teams 
and address security early and consistently in DevOps 
environments. By integrating security practices into the 
software development life cycle (SDLC) and CI pipelines, 
DevSecOps aims to shift security from a separate, 
standalone phase to an integral part of the development 
life cycle. 

DevSecOps has gained significant traction in every 
organization involved with software development. 
According to the SANS 2023 DevSecOps survey, 
DevSecOps is now clearly seen as a business\-
critical practice and a risk management concern. But 
historically, security and development teams have found 
themselves at odds when trying to introduce security 
into their processes, often a consequence of bringing 
legacy application security testing (AST) into the SDLC. 
Common complaints include AST tools’ complexity and 
high learning curves, slow performance, and “noisy” 
results causing DevOps “friction”—that is, anything in the 
software creation process that prevents developers from 
easily and quickly building code.

Benefits of automation 
A core tenet of DevOps is to automate manual 
processes within each stage of the SDLC. Automation 
is a fundamental requirement before any organization 
can implement continuous integration or continuous 
deployment to develop and deliver code faster. 

Successful DevSecOps requires the interplay of 
integration and automation, governed by standards and 
policies. This allows security teams to trust that security 
interests are being covered, and allows DevOps teams to 
keep working and trust that there won’t be unpredictable 
breakdowns in the pipeline. 

Unlike manual testing, automated security tests can be 
executed quickly and consistently, allowing developers to 
identify issues early in the development process without 
impacting delivery schedules or productivity. 

 State of DevSecOps 2023 
 State of DevSecOps 2023 

Consistency
Automated tests ensure that security checks are consistently applied to every build and deployment. 
Manual testing might lead to variations in testing procedures and coverage.

Scalability
As software grows in complexity, manual testing becomes impractical. Automated tests can easily scale 
to handle a large number of tests across various components.

Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
Automated testing is crucial in CI/CD pipelines, where rapid and frequent code changes are deployed. 
Automated tests validate changes quickly and prevent faulty code from reaching production.

Continuous improvement
Automated testing provides data and insights that help teams improve security practices over time. 
Patterns of vulnerabilities can be analyzed and addressed systematically.

Documentation
Automated tests document the testing process, making it easier to track and audit security measures and 
compliance requirements.

Reduction of human error
Manual testing can be error\-prone due to fatigue or oversight. Automated tests follow predefined scripts, 
reducing the risk of human error.

Time and cost savings
Identifying and fixing security issues late in the development process or in production can be time\-
consuming and costly. Automated testing minimizes these expenses.

Improved developer experience
Automated application security testing enhances the developer experience by offering proactive, 
integrated, and educational solutions to address security concerns. This ultimately leads to more secure 
software and a more efficient development process.

The growing use of ASOC/ASPM in 
DevSecOps
This report examines the characteristics of 
organizations at various stages of DevSecOps maturity 
and the security tools/practices the organizations 
employ. Based on the survey results, we offer 
prescriptive recommendations to those striving to attain 
a higher level of security maturity. 

An interesting data point seen in the findings is the 
growing use of application security orchestration and 
correlation (ASOC), now more commonly referred to 
as application security posture management (ASPM). 
According to Gartner, ASPM should be a priority for 
any organization that uses multiple development and 
security tools. 

ASPM solutions continuously manage application risks 
through the detection, correlation, and prioritization 
of security issues from development to deployment. 
ASPM tools ingest data from multiple sources and then 
correlate and analyze findings for easier interpretation, 
triage, and remediation. 

ASPM also acts as a management and orchestration 
layer for security tools, enabling controls and the 
enforcement of security policies. And by providing 
a consolidated perspective of application security 
findings, ASPM offers a comprehensive view of security 
and risk status across an entire application or system. 

Given that the majority of the 1,000 survey respondents 
cited their general unhappiness with the AST tools they 
have in use—criticisms included that those tools don’t 
prioritize remediation based on business needs (35%) 
and they can’t consolidate/correlate results for issue 
resolution (29%)—it’s little wonder that the use of ASOC/
ASPM is growing rapidly.

Key Findings from the Synopsys 
2023 DevSecOps Survey 

The majority of DevOps teams have adopted some 
level of DevSecOps 
A total of 91% of respondents reported that they 
incorporate some measure of DevSecOps activities into 
their software development pipelines. It’s safe to say 
that adoption of the DevSecOps methodology is now an 
established part of software development. 

Organizations with a more mature security program 
have personnel focused on security 
Twenty\-nine percent of survey respondents noted that 
a cross\-functional DevSecOps team—a collaborative 
group from development, security, and operations—was 
an important factor in a security program’s success. 
Personnel focused on security, working with developers/
software engineers and/or QA and testing, are likely to 
be on the front lines of security testing in organizations 
with mature security programs. 

There are many barriers to effectively implementing 
DevSecOps 
Over 33% of respondents pointed to inadequate security 
training as a major roadblock. This was closely followed 
by a shortage of security personnel (31%), lack of 
transparency into development/operations work (31%), 
and continuously changing priorities (30%). 

Over a third of respondents said that integrating 
automated security testing into build/deploy 
workflows was key to a security program’s success 
Other critical factors included enforcing security/
compliance policies through infrastructure\-as\-code, 
developing security champions in dev and ops teams, 
and improving communications across dev, ops, and 
security teams. 

Dealing with critical vulnerabilities late in the SDLC 
dramatically impacts the bottom line 
More than 80% of respondents said that critical 
vulnerability/security issues in deployed software 
impacted their delivery schedules in some form during 
2022\-23\. 

Twenty\-eight percent of respondents said their 
organizations take as much as three weeks to patch 
critical security risks/vulnerabilities in deployed 
applications; another 20% said it can take up to a 
month
These figures are especially disturbing because 
vulnerabilities are being exploited faster than ever. 
The latest studies show that well over half of reported 
vulnerabilities are exploited within a week of disclosure. 

Over 70% said automated scanning of code for 
vulnerabilities or coding flaws is a useful security 
measure, with 34% calling automated AST “very 
useful” 
Automated scanning of code for security vulnerabilities 
and other defects led the “usefulness of tool/processes” 
category, followed closely by “defining security 
requirements as part of SDLC requirements stage” and 
“formal measurement of a software security program 
through models such as BSIMM and SAMM.” 

Nearly all respondents agreed that AST tools don’t 
align with their business needs 
The majority of the 1,000 respondents cited as major 
problems a variety of issues with AST tools—including 
that those tools don’t prioritize remediation based 
on business needs (35%) and they can’t consolidate/
correlate results for issue resolution (29%). 

Fifty\-two percent of security professionals are 
already actively using AI in their DevSecOps 
practices, but more than three\-quarters are 
concerned about issues with AI use 
The survey results indicate that AI, machine learning, 
natural language processing, and neural networks are 
in active use by security teams. However, the growing 
use of generative AI tools such as AI\-powered coding 
suggestions are spawning questions—in some cases, 
even lawsuits—around IP ownership, copyright, and 
licensing of the AI\-generated code.

Figure A How would you best describe the maturity of your current software security program/initiative? 

DevSecOps adoption
Over a third of the 1,000 respondents characterized 
their security initiatives at a Level 3 stage of maturity, in 
which security processes are documented, repeatable, 
and standardized across the organization. Twenty\-five 
percent felt that they had attained Level 4, with security 
processes also logged, monitored, and measured. 

With a total of 91% of respondents reporting that they 
have applied some type of DevSecOps activities into 
their software development pipelines, adoption of 
DevSecOps appears to have become an established part 
of DevOps. 

Level I: Security processes are unstructured/disorganized.

Level II: Security processes are documented and repeatable for specific team.

Level III: Level II processes and procedures are standardized across organization. A proactive security culture is 
endorsed and communicated by leadership.

Level IV: Security processes and controls are logged, managed, and monitored.

Level V: Security processes are continuously analyzed and improved.

Implementation of security practices 
indicate a higher level of maturity
Another measurement of DevSecOps maturity can be 
seen in Figure B, indicative that the respondents have 
adopted a broad set of security practices, ranging from 
continuous monitoring and measurement (30%) to 
automated testing (28%). 

The leading practice, security risk management, cited by 
358 respondents (35\.1%), involves integrating security 
considerations at every stage of the development 
process to identify, assess, and mitigate potential 
security risks associated with a software application. 
Applied within the SDLC, overall security risk 
management entails 

• Requirement analysis. Identifying security 

requirements and constraints early in the SDLC and 
defining security objectives.

• Design. Incorporating security principles into 

the system architecture and design to ensure an 
application’s design includes appropriate safeguards 
against common vulnerabilities.

• Development. Implementing secure coding practices 

and adhering to coding standards that address 
security concerns. Using integrated security testing 
tools such as static application security testing (SAST) 
and software composition analysis (SCA) to catch 
vulnerabilities as code is written and open source or 
third\-party dependencies are brought in.

• Testing. Performing various types of security testing, 
such as SAST, dynamic application security testing 
(DAST), SCA, and penetration testing to identify 
vulnerabilities in the application. 

• Deployment. Securely configuring the environment 

where the application will run. Implementing access 
controls, network security, and proper authentication 
and authorization mechanisms.

• Monitoring and measurement. Continuously 

monitoring the application in production for security 
incidents and anomalies. Implementing logging 
and monitoring solutions to detect and respond to 
potential breaches. This was cited by 30% of survey 
respondents as a major security practice in their 
organization.

• Response and remediation. Creating an incident 

response plan to address security incidents quickly 
and effectively. Remediating risks detected during the 
testing phase. 

• Transparency and security enablement. Establishing 
clear standards, criteria, policies, and reporting of 
security risks and risk tolerance. 

• Training. Providing training to development teams on 
secure coding practices, common vulnerabilities, and 
security best practices. This empowers developers to 
proactively address security concerns. Unfortunately, 
34% of our survey respondents cited “inadequate/
ineffective security training for developers/engineers” 
as one of the major blocks to implementing 
DevSecOps effectively at their organization.

• Continuous improvement. Regularly reviewing and 

improving the security processes and practices within 
the SDLC.

Measuring a security program
Nearly 70% of respondents said that measuring 
their security programs through an assessment tool 
such as Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM) 
was a useful exercise, with over a third calling such 
assessments “very useful.” 

An outside assessment of a security posture allows 
organizations to analyze and benchmark their software 
security program against other organizations and 
industry peers. Tools such as BSIMM provide an 
objective, data\-driven analysis on which to base 
decisions of resources, time, budget, and priorities. 
Comparing other software security programs with your 
own can guide the strategy for your efforts, whether 
you’re in the early stages of implementing a security 
program or want to ensure that your existing program 
can address changing business and security needs. 

If you’re in charge of, or beginning to build, a software 
security program, understanding AppSec trends among 
your peer organizations can help you plan strategic 
improvements to your own security efforts. If you’re 
running a security program from the technical side, 
you can use the information garnered by a BSIMM 
or Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) 
assessment to define tactical improvements for people 
and processes—for example, by building a Security 
Champions program. 

33%

Consider developing security champions 
in Dev and Ops teams a significant factor 
in their security program's success

In fact, according to the BSIMM report, one of the 
first initiatives that many software security groups 
undertake is identifying people who are a driving 
force in software security but not directly connected 
to a software security group. Collectively referred 
to as “software security champions,” these people 
can enable and emphasize software security efforts. 
Security champions in engineering teams, for instance, 
can encourage engineers to own the security of their 
software deliverables. Developing a Security Champions 
program was cited by 33% of survey respondents as a 
key factor to a security program’s success.

The importance of cross\-functional teams 
for DevSecOps success
Twenty\-nine percent of survey respondents noted that 
a cross\-functional DevSecOps team—a collaborative 
group from development, security, and operations—was 
an important key to a security program’s success (see 
Appendix Q16\). Personnel with a focus on security, 
working with developers/software engineers and/or 
QA and testing teams (whether formally in DevSecOps 
groups or otherwise) are likely to be on the front lines of 
security testing in organizations in more mature security 
programs. 

Monolithic, stove\-piped security teams that stepped in 
to test shortly before or after deployment have gone 
the way of the dodo. In today’s software development 
environment, security testing is the responsibility of the 
entire engineering team, including QA, dev, and ops, and 
most will have had a hand in building security into their 
software at different stages of the SDLC. 

Thirty\-three percent of respondents mentioned that 
external consultants also conducted security tests 
for their organizations. Best practices advise that 
organizations should conduct security audits regularly. 
It can be invaluable to contract third\-party auditors or 
penetration testers to conduct such tests in order to 
gain an unbiased view of an organization’s security 
posture.

Combining manual and automated testing 
for the best results
The survey results indicate that the majority of 
respondents feel combining manual and automated 
security testing provides a more comprehensive 
approach to assessing the security of business\-critical 
applications. As important as automated testing is for 
consistency, scalability, and time and cost\-savings, the 
human factor adds a layer of insight and adaptability 
essential for identifying complex and subtle security 
issues. For example, the very nature of DAST as 
“black box” testing (that is, without knowledge of an 
application’s internal structure) requires developer and 
security experts to verify and triage findings.

Similarly, the fact that 44% of respondents include 
external pen testing as a key element of their security 
testing demonstrates the value of penetration testing 
as a complement to internal testing. Often required to 
comply with industry regulations and standards, external 
pen testing brings added benefits such as an unbiased 
viewpoint of your security posture, as well as accurate 
simulation of potential threats and vulnerabilities that 
external adversaries might exploit.

Key performance indicators
Respondents were asked to pick the top three key 
performance indicators (KPIs) used to measure the 
success of their DevSecOps program. Overall reduction 
of open security vulnerabilities was cited by 295 
respondents (29%), closely followed by the 28% (288 
respondents) who referenced a reduction of security\-
related discoveries late in the SDLC as a crucial KPI. 
Rounding out the top three KPIs was issue resolution 
time, noted by 28% (281 respondents). 

As the survey results demonstrate, time, productivity, 
and costs are the three commonalities among the 
top KPIs and the challenges organizations face in 
implementing a secure SDLC. Or, in other words, the 
three major questions those involved with DevSecOps 
face are 

• How can we reduce the number of vulnerabilities/

issues we encounter?

Number of open security vulnerabilities

Reduction of security\-related discoveries late in the development process

Issue resolution time

Reduction in hours spent resolving security issues

Reduction in security\-related build delays

Reduction in security\-failed builds

• What can we do to move vulnerability discovery earlier

Which AST tools are in use? How useful 
are they?
The survey results show that successful DevSecOps 
strategies use a full security toolset—including 
dynamic application security testing (DAST), interactive 
application security testing (IAST), static application 
security testing (SAST), and software composition 
analysis (SCA) tools—to address code quality and 
security flaws throughout the software development life 
cycle. 

SAST was found to be the leading AST tool used by 
respondents, with 72% finding it useful. It was closely 
followed by IAST (69%), SCA (68%), and DAST (67%). 

SAST and DAST use different testing approaches 
that work most effectively in different phases of the 
SDLC. SAST is critical for uncovering and eliminating 
vulnerabilities in proprietary software early in the SDLC, 
before the application is deployed. DAST, on the other 
hand, is used after deployment to spot issues that 
manifest at runtime, such as authentication and network 
configuration flaws. Combining some of the features 
of both SAST and DAST, IAST is used to detect critical 
security flaws that may not be identified by other types 
of tests. 

SCA is used to identify and manage open source 
security and license risk, a critical need in modern 
software development, especially considering that over 
three\-quarters of the code in any given application is 
likely to be open source. And since many organizations 
use packaged software procured from independent 
software vendors, as well as Internet of Things (IoT) 
devices and embedded firmware, many will also need 
some form of SCA binary analysis in their AST toolbox.

on several factors, including the business criticality of 
the application, the industry, and the threat landscape. 
For highly critical applications, assessments should 
be performed regularly, as reflected in our survey 
results (Figure H). Most respondent organizations run 
vulnerability scans on business\-critical applications an 
average of two to three days a week. 

On first blush, the survey results showing that 28% of 
organizations take up to three weeks to patch critical 
vulnerabilities (Figure I) may seem concerning, but there 
are other factors to consider. There is a myth that the 
proverbial developer can fix each and every vulnerability, 
but no one can rationally expect developers to dig into 
vulnerabilities that haven’t been prioritized for resolution. 

It’s worth noting that 31% of respondents cited “lack of 
transparency into development/operations work,” while 
another 29% identified “organizational silos between 
development, operations, security” as major barriers in 
implementing DevSecOps (Figure K). Both are indicative 
of issues with the communication of risk from security 
to development and the need for rapid alerting and 
automation with security policies. 

In any case, patch priorities need to align with the 
business importance of the asset being patched, the 
criticality of the asset, and the risk of exploitation. That 
last is of high importance. Studies show that well over 
half of reported vulnerabilities are exploited within a 
week of disclosure.

With that in mind, organizations need to prioritize their 
efforts based on Common Vulnerability Scoring System 
(CVSS) scores and Common Weakness Enumeration 
(CWE) information, as well as the availability of exploits, 
not only on “day zero” of a vulnerability disclosure but 
over the life cycle of the application. 

CVSS scores are an industry standard for assessing the 
severity of a vulnerability. Vulnerabilities in the National 
Vulnerability Database (NVD) have a base score that 
aids in calculating severity and can be used as a factor 
for prioritizing remediation. The CVSS score provides 
an overall base score that takes both exploitability and 
impact into account. 

Temporal scores consider metrics that change over time 
owing to events that are external to the vulnerability. 
Remediation levels (Is there an official fix available?) 
and report confidence (Is the report confirmed?) can 
help temper the overall CVSS score to an appropriate 
level of risk. 

CWE information lists software or hardware 
weaknesses that have security ramifications. A CWE 
tells developers which weakness could be exploited 
if an exploit is available. This information can help 
security and development teams understand where 
to focus developer security training, which additional 
security controls to implement across the SDLC and 
into production, and adds one more mechanism for 
assessing risk severity. For example, a development 
team may prioritize a SQL injection differently than a 
buffer overflow or denial of service, given the context of 
the data the application touches, where it is deployed, 
and other environmental and security factors. 

The existence of an exploit will raise the risk score and 
help teams prioritize the highest\-risk vulnerabilities for 
remediation. Understanding whether there is an existing 
patch, mitigating factor, or compensating controls 
is another key piece of information to examine once 
you have assessed the overall risk. If you have two 
medium\-risk vulnerabilities without exploits available, 
for example, the final determination of which to fix first 
might come down to whether either has a patch or 
workaround available. 

Critical security or vulnerability issues in deployed 
applications tend to cascade downhill, not only through 
their potential of disrupting an organization’s (or its 
customers’) business operations, but also their impact 
on the entire SDLC, as shown in Figure J. 

Issues that might have been minor fixes if they had been 
caught early in development could mutate into “all hands 
on deck” firedrills in deployed applications. Automated 
security testing tools, integrated into IDEs and CI 
pipelines, can identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses 
in the code as soon as—or even before—it’s committed, 
enabling developers to address issues before they 
propagate downstream.

Challenges to effective DevSecOps
The shortage of cybersecurity personnel is a significant 
challenge for DevSecOps, with many organizations 
unable to fill critical cybersecurity positions, as reflected 
in Figure K. According to some studies, there are 3\.5 
million unfilled cybersecurity jobs around the world. 
As the demand for trained cybersecurity professionals 
grows, the scarcity of supply is driving up wages for 
skilled practitioners, pricing out many government 
entities and SMBs. But, as the top response indicates, 
inadequate security training for developers/engineers 
remains the biggest challenge. 

One strategy that has shown to be effective to 
address these issues is the development of a Security 
Champions program, a collection of people across 
the organization who show an above\-average level of 
security interest or skill and who are already contributing 
software security expertise to development, QA, and 
operations teams. Security champions can act as a 
sounding board for new projects, and in new or fast\-
moving technology areas, help combine software 
security skills with domain knowledge that might be 
under\-represented in security or engineering teams. 
Agile coaches, scrum masters, and DevOps engineers 
can make particularly useful security champions, 
especially for detecting and removing process friction.

As noted earlier in this report, AST tools such as SAST, 
DAST, IAST, and SCA are all widely used by respondents, 
but effectively aligning those tools to business needs 
remains a challenge (Figure L). 

Many respondents complained that the security testing 
tools they use do not prioritize resolution based on such 
factors as exposure, exploitability, and criticality; are too 
slow to fit into continuous deployment release cycles; 
and are inaccurate and unreliable. 

With no way to consolidate or correlate results from 
different security tests, security and DevOps teams 
spend too much time determining what needs to be 
fixed first—probably one of the reasons why nearly three\-
quarters of respondents noted that their organizations 
can take anywhere from two weeks to a month to patch 
known critical vulnerabilities (Figure I). 

Failure to patch quickly affects the bottom line. More 
than 80% of respondents said that dealing with critical 
vulnerabilities or related security issues of deployed 
software impacted their delivery schedules during 2022\-
23 (Figure J). 

The problems of fragmented AST tools and slow 
remediation are precisely what application security 
orchestration and correlation (ASOC) and application 
security posture management (ASPM) are designed 
to address. Gartner notes that ASOC/ASPM acts as a 
management layer to orchestrate multiple AST tools, 
automatically correlating and contextualizing findings to 
accelerate and focus remediation. 

By ingesting results from diverse sources and providing 
a unified view of risk across the application landscape, 
ASOC/ASPM enables data\-driven prioritization based 
on business context like criticality and facilitates faster 
patching of the highest\-risk vulnerabilities. By providing 
visibility into production environments, ASOC/ASPM 
closes the gap between lengthy remediation times for 
deployed applications and the reality that most exploits 
appear within days.

Promises and pitfalls of AI
These survey results demonstrate that AI use is already 
deeply embedded in many organizations’ software 
security initiatives, with over 50% of respondents 
indicating that they are actively using AI in their 
DevSecOps practices. Fifty\-four percent expect AI to 
improve the efficiency and accuracy of their security 
measures. Forty\-eight percent hope that AI will help 
reduce manual review of security testing. 

This makes sense when you consider the major 
advantages AI could potentially provide for DevSecOps. 
AppSec teams are constantly caught between the need 
to perform complete and consistent security testing 
and the need to keep pace with development teams 
using DevOps methodologies and CI pipelines. When 
deadlines are tight, it’s easy for developers to skip key 
security risk–assessment procedures. 

Survey respondents cited “improve accuracy and 
efficiency of security measures” (54%) and “reduce 
the need for manual review and analysis of security 
data” (48%) as two major benefits they anticipate from 
introducing AI into the secure SDLC. 

Note that respondents also said, however, that they 
expected AI to “increase the complexity and technical 
requirements of software security,” perhaps anticipating 
that at some future point, the only entities capable of 
adequately reviewing AI\-generated code may be AI itself.

Implementing AI in DevSecOps comes with additional 
challenges, such as ensuring data quality and 
addressing security and privacy concerns. As AI tools 
are more integrated into the DevOps pipeline, they will 
almost certainly become key targets for security threats. 
The handling of sensitive data used for AI training can 
raise privacy issues as well. 

One scenario that illustrates potential risks of AI 
in action is the use of AI\-assisted coding, which is 
generating questions around ownership, copyright, and 
licensing of the AI\-created code. 

In late 2022, a class\-action lawsuit was filed against 
GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI, claiming that GitHub 
Copilot—a cloud\-based AI tool that offers developers 
autocomplete\-style suggestions as they code—violates 
both copyright law and software licensing requirements, 
as well as the rights of the developers whose open 
source code the Copilot service is trained on. The 
lawsuit further claims that the code suggested by 
Copilot uses licensed materials without attribution, 
copyright notice, or adherence to the original licensing 
terms.

Large language model–based generative AI chatbots 
such as ChatGPT and Google Bard also have the 
problem of randomly producing “hallucinations,” false 
responses that may seem credible and confident but are 
not true—in lay terms, a “lie.” 

AI hallucinations are a clear danger to software supply 
chain security. Researchers have found that ChatGPT 
may recommend a hallucinatory nonexistent code library 
or package. A malicious actor could create a package 
with the same name, fill it with malicious code, and then 
distribute it to unsuspecting developers who follow the 
AI’s recommendations. This could be a game\-changer 
for cybercriminals, allowing them to sidestep more 
traditional and easily detectable techniques such as 
typosquatting or masquerading. In fact, the researchers 
discovered malicious packages created through 
ChatGPT’s hallucinatory recommendations already on 
popular package installers like PyPI and npm. 

That threat isn’t theoretical; it’s real and happening right 
now. Whether defending against supply chain attacks 
originating from AI hallucinations or malicious actors, 
it’s crucial to know your code’s origin, authenticate 
developers and maintainers, and only download from 
reliable vendors or sources.

Lessons Learned 
While most organizations have largely adopted some 
level of DevSecOps practices, they continue to face 
barriers to its effective implementation. Two major 
problem areas emerged from the survey. 

• Integrating and aligning the results of multiple 

application security testing (AST) tools to meet 
business priorities

• Reducing the time needed to resolve critical 

vulnerabilities 

Twenty\-eight percent of respondents said their 
organizations take as much as three weeks to patch 
critical security risks/vulnerabilities in deployed 
applications. Another 20% said it can take up to a month, 
even as most exploits appear within days. Respondents 
cited an inability to prioritize vulnerability resolution 
based on business need as a top complaint they have 
with AST tools. 

As mentioned in the introduction to this report, one 
of the challenges of developing the survey questions 
was that term “DevSecOps” embraces several different 
disciplines, many of which have unique personas. When 
it comes to “business priorities,” the term can mean 
different things to different personas. 

For example, a priority to business leaders is the 
need to understand how effective their AppSec tools 
are, and they want complete visibility into process 
and performance across teams. Development and 
operations teams want a centralized view of all issues 
so they can identify the security activities that have the 
most impact. Those whose focus is on security want to 
cut through the noise to prioritize critical issues quickly. 

For organizations struggling to gain cohesion across 
siloed security tools while keeping pace with business 

demands, application security posture management 
(ASPM) can provide a needed force multiplier. 
Automating coordination, context, and prioritization, 
ASPM allows organizations to focus efforts on the 
application security business priorities that matter most 
to them. 

• By integrating with development and security testing 
tools and operations monitoring tools, ASPM offers 
a single, consolidated view of security\-related 
information from different parts of the organization.
• By correlating and grouping data from different tools 
analyzing specific applications and vulnerabilities, 
ASPM can deliver a comprehensive view of the 
application’s overall security stance. DevSecOps 
groups can produce data relevant to their roles and 
responsibilities, and ASPM makes it possible to 
view that data in a way that makes sense to line\-of\-
business managers and others who require a broader 
perspective.

• ASPM enables the creation and enforcement of 
security policies for specific applications and 
the specific risks a vulnerability may pose. When 
integrated with development or operational 
infrastructure, ASPM also enables the identification of 
security issues that require remediation as early in the 
process as possible. 

Using data from 2021, Gartner noted that about 5% 
of its surveyed organizations had adopted ASPM or 
the application security orchestration and correlation 
(ASOC) tools from which they evolved. Gartner expects 
the pace of adoption to accelerate rapidly, a prediction 
reflected in these 2023 survey results, which show 28% 
of respondents using ASOC/ASPM. As Gartner also 
notes, the early adopters tend to be groups with mature 
DevSecOps programs and those using multiple security 
tools, both characteristic of our DevSecOps survey 
respondents. 

The survey explored in this report makes a compelling 
case that fragmented results from security tools, 
overloaded teams, and slow vulnerability resolution 
represent fundamental challenges to successful 
DevSecOps. For those organizations with diverse 
DevSecOps teams using multiple application security 
testing tools, ASPM could be the key to effectively 
addressing those challenges.
