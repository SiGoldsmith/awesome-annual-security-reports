# Security 2023: Quick Reaction Force
02	Security 2023: Quick Reaction Force
* The state of the SOC
* Impact of the talent crisis
* Mitigating talent challenges
* Resilience is the main metric

Cyberattacks continue to grow in quantity and sophistication at the same time that organizations’ systems become increasingly complex. Security teams, as always, feel the stress. But a surprising outcome of our 2023 State of Security research is that the number of respondents who say they just can’t keep up has shrunk.

Don’t plan a victory parade just yet; 53% of respondents worldwide tell us that keeping up with security requirements is harder than it was two years ago, and that’s still a lot. But the number in 2022 was 66%. Our own security experts, able to spot the dark lining in every silver cloud, note that 2022 didn’t have as many novel developments to throw security teams into disarray; no SolarWinds, no Log4J. “No iceberg for your organizational Titanic,” to quote them directly.

Whether this data represents incremental improvement or a one-time windfall, organizations should press any advantage. Which won’t be easy: Most security teams tell us they’re too stuck in reactive mode to be effectively proactive.

## Methodology
Researchers surveyed 1,520 security and IT leaders who spend half or more of their time on security issues.

### 10 Countries
Equally split across North America, Western Europe, and Asia-Pacific: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, United Kingdom, United States

### 15 Industries
Aerospace and defense, consumer packaged goods, education, energy, financial services (banking, securities, insurance), government (federal/national, state and local), healthcare, life sciences, manufacturing, media, retail/wholesale, technology, telecom, transportation/logistics, utilities

## Security 2023: Quick Reaction Force
Drilling down, we asked the slim majority who say their job has gotten harder to tell us what’s making it harder. This subset’s top challenges:

* The increasing sophistication of threats (according to 38%, ranking it No. 1 for the third straight year)
* Security stack complexity (according to 30%)
* IaaS and SaaS driving challenges in risk monitoring and management (29% and 28%, respectively)
* Workload demands trapping teams in “react mode” (28%)

That last bullet is further reflected in several trailing responses. Respondents tell us that they are overwhelmed by the number of attacks (24%) and false positives (25%). Another 25% each say they struggle to hire or retain enough skilled staffers.

There are global variations in terms of struggle. Organizations in the Asia-Pacific region are five to seven percentage points more likely than the global average to say that it’s hard to monitor SaaS applications and to effectively analyze all security data. European respondents are less likely to voice that complaint, while North American orgs hewed to the worldwide average.

> We see tremendous challenges

Some of the most noteworthy stats you’ll read in this year’s report include:

* 64% of SOC teams struggle to pivot from one security tool to the next, with little integration to make it easier.
* 88% of respondents report talent challenges, whether key, high-level skills or just hiring enough bodies.
* Bad guys get in. And when they do, their average dwell time is 2.24 months, or about nine long weeks.

We also see efforts to address the countless challenges. High points include:

* 95% of organizations have increased their focus on third-party risk assessment.
* 81% of orgs are converging aspects of security and IT operations.
* 95% of security budgets will increase over the next two years — 56% of them “significantly.”

## Security 2023: Quick Reaction Force
We found that across industries and geography, security leaders and their peers throughout the organization are increasingly collaborating to improve resilience. Classic cybersecurity is concerned with proactive prevention of incidents, while resilience is reactive: It’s about what you do once an incident occurs.

But preparing your organization to most efficiently recover from a crisis is very much a proactive undertaking. Risk assessment, incident response planning and key investments in technology and training, and more — these require strategic thinking beyond the strict confines of cybersecurity. Our respondents tell us that security teams are finding more success at partnering across the organization, being seen as valuable partners — enablers rather than the Dept. of No-Can-Do. As we’ll cover below, 79% of line-of-business stakeholders see the security team as valued partners, rewarding those teams with a seat at the collaborative table and better funding.

And the business leaders to set the budget for security are increasingly looking at metrics that measure resilience, starting with mean time to recover. In fact, MTTR tops the list.

### Top Cybersecurity Challenges
Respondents chose their top three internal challenges.

![Chart showing top cybersecurity challenges]

We spend most of our time addressing emergencies 31%
We focus on regulatory compliance rather than security best practices 27%
We have too many disconnected cybersecurity point tools 26%
Our staff lacks the skills to deal with sophisticated threats 24%
We don’t have the right security controls in place to prevent or respond to sophisticated threats 24%
We don’t do enough cybersecurity training for non-technical employees 23%
We struggle to keep up with the volume of security alerts 23%
Our cybersecurity team is understaffed 22%
Exec management lacks cybersecurity knowledge/commitment 22%
We depend on too many manual and/or informal cybersecurity processes 21%
We don’t do enough basic hygiene on IT assets 21%

The State of Security 2023   |   Splunk 05

## Security 2023: Quick Reaction Force
Across the board, whether they say that they’re overwhelmed or not, respondents identified a diffuse range of challenges. While no one type of crisis dominated, the generalized problem of spending too much time tackling emergencies pulled into a comfortable first place.

There are a number of causes for this perpetual reactive mode and, frankly, not a lot of solutions. Organizations experience cyberattacks by the thousands, so a reactive stance is inevitable. While smart security teams do their best to get ahead of known attack vectors, there are always new techniques that send you scrambling again.

Additionally, compliance just doesn’t get easier. The increasing sophistication of technology, of the ways in which data is used, and the methods of attack all mean that regulatory standards will (eventually) rise as well.

> 55% of respondents expect that hiring and retention would be harder in a recession.
> 32% think that hiring and retention would get easier.

As economies tip toward recession, staffing challenges are expected to get even more acute.

## Security 2023: Quick Reaction Force
### The state of the SOC
As the previous pages indicate, security teams are strained. Today’s security operations center has a lot to cover, and not enough people to cover it.

* 64% of SOC teams complain about pivoting among too many disparate security tools and management consoles, with little (if any) integration, inhibiting comprehensive and timely investigations and response.
* 49% say that they lack enough staff to manually triage, investigate and respond to an increasing volume of security events.

The result: increased risk resulting from their workload. On average, respondents estimate that 41% of alerts that would be beneficial to investigate are ignored due to a lack of available SOC bandwidth. And of course, the alerts you don’t investigate could include a true positive, allowing an attack to succeed. This undermines everything: the actual return on your investment in the expensive tools generating these alerts, the efficiency and morale of your analyst team, and the actual security and resilience of your organization.

### How SOCs Work
![Chart showing how SOCs work]

58% beyond business hours but not 24/365
15% 24/365 but with reduced bandwidth outside of business hours
11% 24/365 at full bandwidth
17% only during business hours

The State of Security 2023   |   Splunk 07

## Security 2023: Quick Reaction Force
### Impact of the talent crisis
The perennial labor shortage remains a serious problem: 88% of respondents report challenges with cybersecurity staffing/skills, including 53% who say that they can’t hire enough staff generally (matching last year’s finding) and 59% (up from 58%) who can’t find talent with the right particular skills.

Security leaders are turning to managed security service providers in high numbers (42% are increasing their use of MSSPs), allowing teams to both beef up off-hours coverage and offload tier-one issues around the clock. Despite this, the talent struggle has led to a number of issues over the last 12 months:

* 81% of respondents say that members of their staff have been forced to take on responsibilities that they aren’t ready for — up from 76% last year.
* 81% report that critical staff member(s) left the organization for another job due to burnout.
* 78% of respondents say the resulting increase in their workload has led them to consider looking for a new role — up from 70% a year ago.
* 77% say one or more projects/initiatives have failed — up from 68%.

Talent is always in crisis in the cybersecurity space. But these numbers show not just a chronic condition, but an increasingly acute one. Shrugging it off as “It’s always like this” would be a crucial mistake.

### Highest-Priority Tactics to Overcome Talent Challenges
(besides hiring)

![Chart showing highest-priority tactics to overcome talent challenges]

Increasing the level of investment in training for our staff 46%
Simplifying our security tool portfolio via vendor rationalization/using more platform-based controls 44%
Better capture and analysis of security data 44%
Streamlining/automating security processes 43%
Increasing our use of MSSPs/outsourcers 42%
Increasing investment in commercial security controls 42%
Offloading more security responsibilities to IT generalists 38%

The top choice for all regions was “more training” (45-47%), though in the Asia-Pacific region, “more investment in commercial security controls” tied for first place (at 47%).

The State of Security 2023   |   Splunk 08

## Security 2023: Quick Reaction Force
### Mitigating talent challenges
Security leaders are taking steps to mitigate the challenges. As noted on the previous page, MSSPs are playing a bigger role: 86% of organizations have relied on service providers to help close skill gaps. In fact, 56% of respondents say the majority of security operations work at their organization is outsourced to a third-party service provider, most often to extend security operations to be more continuous and to gain access to service providers’ more advanced tooling. Forty-two percent say they plan to increase those engagements.

Then there’s looking for more help within one’s org: 86% of organizations have started reskilling individuals outside of the security team to help fill gaps, with 38% planning to offload more security tasks to IT staff in the coming year.

Increased training is the No. 1 choice, besides more hiring, for respondents in every region. The top areas that security teams are under pressure to upskill include cloud operations and architecture (41%) and secure application development (42%).

Additionally, security teams are embracing automation and improving their tooling, and making data a focus (see chart), as a means of making shorthanded teams ever more effective.

### How Business Leaders Measure Security Success
Top metrics used by business leaders to understand cybersecurity

![Chart showing how business leaders measure security success]

Security efficiency metrics like MTTD and MTTR 34%
Regulatory compliance (e.g., number of times found in violation, speed of reacting to audit requests) 31%
Cyber risk quantification/mitigation metrics 30%
Downtime/availability of key applications due to security incidents 30%
Number of successful attacks 29%
Number of incidents detected and inspected 29%
Progress on critical security programs 27%
Number of new initiatives supported (e.g., security as an enabler vs. blocker) 25%
Ability to remain under budget 24%
Return on cyber investment 22%

## Security 2023: Quick Reaction Force
### Resilience is the main metric
We asked respondents to indicate the top three performance metrics used by business leaders to judge security effectiveness, and saw a significant indication of a resilience mindset. In the chart at right, four of the top six responses (all but compliance and risk mitigation) play directly into resilience strategies, with mean time to detect and recover coming out on top (34%), and downtime (30%) ahead of counting attacks and incidents.

Whereas the quantity or sophistication of attacks you face is outside your control — you don’t know who’s coming at you next — you can definitely measure your MTTR. And if you accept that service disruptions are inevitable, then how quickly and effectively you deal with them really matters.

“MTTR is easier to measure and improve,” notes Splunk Distinguished Security Strategist Ryan Kovar, who leads our SURGe threat advisory team. “You can’t necessarily hone your MTTD, because the threats are unknown. SolarWinds was a novel attack, and your time to detect on that was two years. But you can drill for MTTR. And that’s where you create resilience.”

> 79% of business stakeholders see the security team as a partner, not an obstacle.

The State of Security 2023   |   Splunk 10

## Security 2023: Quick Reaction Force
Security teams have long understood their value to the business and that good security, and strong resilience, is not about saying no to every new initiative. But it has taken time for businesses to understand this mentality and embrace security as an active partner, enabling business success. Our survey this time shows that for most teams, the business side gets it.

Respondents tell us that 79% of line-of-business stakeholders see the security team as either a trusted source of information (49%) or a key enabler of the organization’s mission (30%). It’s a slim minority that still sees security as a necessary inconvenience (12%) or complete roadblock (8%).

The security team’s role as a strategic partner and enabler facilitates the broader collaboration and a holistic focus on resilience, as we’ll see. And at the leadership level, respect and a seat at the table produce tangible results. Respondents told us that access to business leadership improves the security team’s ability to collaborate with other parts of the business (46%) and results in increased security team funding (42%).

## Incidents, Alerts and Threat Vectors
### The existential impact
Security incidents are an existential threat. In addition to the considerable time and resources expended to clean up the mess, significant numbers of respondents say incidents had damaged their company’s competitive position, hurt the stock price, or created a public embarrassment. Only 4% of respondents say they had suffered incidents but experienced no significant consequences.

In terms of attack types, note that by “supply chain attacks” (which hit 46% of respondents, globally) we mean actual attacks that succeeded using that vector. If we’d measured it to mean “you discovered unexploited vulnerabilities in third-party software and remediated them in time,” the number would be higher. By a lot.

Whatever the avenue, once the bad guys get in, they’ve got time to get comfortable. On average, respondents tell us that it’s 2.24 months, or about nine weeks, from the moment a bad actor penetrates their systems until appropriate parties are aware of it. That’s a lot of time to steal or break things.

The State of Security 2023   |   Splunk 13

## Incidents, Alerts and Threat Vectors
The issue resonates at the highest level. Nearly everyone (91%) says their CISO is actively collaborating more with line-of-business leaders (finance, marketing, operations, etc.) on cyber resilience strategies and investments. But those CISOs have their work cut out for them:

* Just 31% say they have a formal approach to cyber resilience that has been instituted organization-wide across critical systems.
* Only 38% have a resilience strategy in place in pockets of the organization.
* 31% say they have yet to implement any resilience strategies.

### Lack of resilience is a dire threat
Security teams understand that they need to improve resilience. Most respondents (62%, up from 54% last year) report that cybersecurity incidents take down business-critical applications at least once a month. The mean number of those outages is about 22 per year (up from 19). Security teams say they’re working to continue to improve those resilience metrics. On average, they say they aim to reduce MTTD by 40% and MTTR by 53%. We did see improvement this year over last year’s research: The average mean time to recover (MTTR) for business-critical workloads suffering from unplanned downtime tied to a cybersecurity incident is 15.5 hours (down from 21.4 hours). Still, downtime costs consume 2.7% of annual revenue.

Controlling those costs isn’t the only issue. Asked why they’re focusing on resilience:

* 83% of respondents agree that their risk of significant business disruption is elevated.
* 79% think a loss of productivity will put them at risk of being out-innovated.
* 78% of respondents agree that downtime’s effect on digital experience may cost them customers.

> While 91% of CISOs are collaborating across the business on resilience, fewer than a third have an organization-wide approach to resilience in place.

### Most Concerning Threat Vulnerabilities

## Incidents, Alerts and Threat Vectors
### Vector by vector
When we asked respondents to review a stressfully long list to pick their three most concerning potential vulnerabilities, the responses are fairly evenly distributed, with no dominant leaders. Two high-profile attack types that deserve a deeper dive are the software supply chain and ransomware, while the ubiquity of public cloud as part of organizations’ attack surface merits its own consideration.

**Supply chain.** Software supply chain attacks are top-of-mind in the post-SolarWinds (and Log4j, and Kaseya, and ...) era. Fully 95% of organizations have increased their focus on third-party risk assessment activity, up from an already noteworthy 90% a year ago.

Looking into the tactics involved reveals a very diffuse approach to supply chain security. From a list of 17 responses to supply chain threats, the top three answers tied with a 26% adoption rate:

* Assessing security controls to understand prevention/detection capabilities specific to supply chain attacks
* Hardening authentication systems
* Increasing security budgets

The fragmentation of responses — the lack of any widely adopted tactic — suggests a disjointed approach to a problem that only recently entered the spotlight.

The State of Security 2023   |   Splunk 15

## Incidents, Alerts and Threat Vectors
**Ransomware.** Ransomware is like Covid-19. You may still know people who haven’t had it yet, but there are fewer of them all the time. Since the 2022 State of Security research, the number of organizations reporting that they had not yet been hit with a ransomware attack dropped from 21% to just 13%. Similarly, while 35% of organizations in 2022 reported having had data/systems held hostage, this year’s number rose to 43%.

When orgs get hit, they’re likelier than ever to pay up. Last year, 66% of organizations said that they (or their insurer) just paid off the attackers. This year, that number is 75%. And ransoms continue to rise: Last year, only 32% of respondents said their largest ransom had been $250,000 or more. This year, it’s 50%. On average, respondents say that the largest ransom they’d paid attackers was $430,978, up 24% (from $346,897) since last year.

(This surprised us, because other research in the past year has suggested ransoms are going down. Rechecking our numbers, we find that the most senior respondents, who should really know, are even more likely (79%) to say that they’ve paid more and more often.)

As with supply chain risks, there’s a wide spread in adoption of tactics to combat ransomware. There’s slightly more commonality in the approaches, though, with two tactics being adopted/accelerated by 33% of respondents: investment in SIEM solutions and focus on email security. Four other tactics had a 31% adoption rate: SOAR, advanced analytics, multifactor authentication, and endpoint configuration hardening tools.

On the other hand, the lower percentage investing in air-gapped backup/restore capabilities (21% of respondents) suggests that organizations are prioritizing detection and response over recovery.

> Data is the answer: 91% of respondents agree that better capture and analysis of detection data is one of the most effective tools to prevent successful ransomware attacks.

> Must know cloud: When we asked about the various areas in which security teams are under pressure to upskill, cloud operations and architecture led — cited by 41% of respondents.

The State of Security 2023   |   Splunk 16

## Incidents, Alerts and Threat Vectors
**Cloud security.** The cloud is where the action is, with 50% of respondents saying that the majority of their SOC team’s time is spent addressing issues in the public cloud, while just 13% spend most of their time on on-premises issues.

This tracks, because much of our IT environments is in the cloud. Fifty-three percent of respondents say that the majority of their business-critical applications and workloads run in the cloud. Interestingly, this is down from 66% a year ago, but still significant. And in the public cloud, the threat is generally not an attack that outwits your cloud provider’s defenses. It’s more likely to be a misconfiguration on your end. The bad guys aren’t looking to break down any doors; they’re trusting you to leave one open for them.

Respondents gave us their top three cloud security challenges:

1. Maintaining security consistency across their data center and public cloud environments (No. 1 for the third year in a row, but with the percentage declining from 45% last year to 33% for 2023)
2. Keeping identity and access management (IAM) systems accurate and up to date (32%, and up from third place a year ago)
3. Use of multiple cybersecurity controls increases cost and complexity (28%, and slipping from No. 2 a year ago)

We then asked them what they’re doing about it. Again, there was a wide range of tactics with no runaway leader, but the most common approaches are:

1. Identifying workload configurations that are out of compliance and/or don’t adhere to industry best practices (No. 1 for the third year in a row, though the percentage declined from 39% in 2022 to 30% this year)
2. The configuration of security groups (e.g., externally facing server workloads) (25%, and up from fourth place a year ago)
3. Improving audit trail understanding among privileged and service accounts (24%, holding steady at No. 3)

Cloud and hybrid architectures are new, complex and ever-changing. They’ll continue to be an area of intense challenge.

# Goals and Strategies

* Converging on resilience
* Budgets rise, priorities shift
* Analytics and automation
* From next-to-zero to resilience hero

The pursuit of cyber resilience and overall business resilience is driving security strategies, from increased funding and collaboration to priorities around cloud, analytics, automation and more.

### Top Security Initiatives
Asked to name their three top priorities, respondents most often cited these.

![Chart showing top security initiatives]

36% analytics and supply chain security
33% security automation
31% DevSecOps
31% security awareness training

The State of Security 2023   |   Splunk 18

## Goals and Strategies
### Converging on resilience
To meet new and persistent challenges, organizations are focusing on resilience and agility. For the next 12 months, 51% of respondents plan solutions or investments that combine cyber resilience efforts with traditional business continuity/disaster recovery preparation. Further, 48% will make investments to speed the recovery of user services, and 47% are planning investments that speed security teams’ response.

Resilience is a team sport, and most respondents understand that converging security operations with other functions (e.g., collaborating more closely, creating hybrid roles that overlay functions, etc.) holds promise:

* 81% of organizations are converging aspects of security and IT operations.
* 69% are converging aspects of security operations and digital experience.
* 69% are converging aspects of security operations and application development.
* 61% are converging aspects of security operations and observability.

Why? Respondents most often believe convergence will help with overall visibility of risks in their environment (58%) and that they will see improved cooperation in threat identification/response processes (55%).

> 95% of security budgets will increase over the next two years — 56% of them “significantly.”

The State of Security 2023   |   Splunk 19

## Goals and Strategies
### Budgets rise, priorities shift
Security teams are spending more and collaborating more broadly. Fully 95% of respondents expect their security spending to increase over the next two years, and 56% say spending will increase significantly (up from 51% a year before).

Where funding will go to tools and technology, there’s an even split in terms of approach: 50% say they’ll focus on platform-based tools with out-of-the-box integration. The other half will emphasize a best-of-breed approach, integrating individual solutions as needed through APIs.

Strategic focuses have shifted since last year, as evident in the top four priorities:

* Developing and building an integrated software architecture for security analytics and operations tools (38% versus 21% a year ago, moving to the top spot from a tie for third)
* Purchasing security operations tools designed to help an organization automate and orchestrate security operations processes (35% versus 22% a year ago)
* Consolidating tools and personnel into an enterprise SOC (35%, up from 15% in 2022 to break into the top 10 responses)
* Developing more formal documented security operations processes (33%, up from 17% and 10th place)

Taken as a whole, these four leading strategies point to a desire to create a more effective, faster-moving and more professionalized SOC.

### Top Priorities for Process Automation
![Chart showing top priorities for process automation]

Process automation across security and IT operations (e.g., vulnerability and patch management) 41%
Orchestrating actions across heterogeneous security controls (e.g., blocking malicious IoCs across endpoints, networks, cloud workloads, etc.) 38%
Security investigations (phishing, insider threat, etc.) 38%
Security operations case management 33%
Incident response/automated remediation 31%
Security operations ticketing system 31%

The State of Security 2023   |   Splunk 20

## Goals and Strategies
### Analytics and automation
Deployment of technologies designed for security analytics and operations automation and orchestration hold remarkably steady this year. Sixty-seven percent report deploying such technologies — 37% extensively. This is essentially unchanged from last year’s research, which found 67% adoption, with 36% doing so extensively.

Respondents say they’re using analytics across the entire attack lifecycle, to improve threat detection (37%), to help identify cyber risks (36%), to accelerate investigations (33%) and automate remediation (35%).

Top uses also include: to automate security processes based on real-time data (33%), and to help determine which investigations to prioritize (also 33%).

From a task perspective, the top targets for automation are:

* 29% prioritize integrating security tools with IT operations systems.
* 27% prioritize integrating external threat intelligence with internal security data.
* 27% prioritize automating basic remediation tasks (such as updating endpoint security controls) with their automation and orchestration initiatives.

### Integration of Security Analytics With Other Analytics Data

The State of Security 2023   |   Splunk 21

## Goals and Strategies
It’s not all forward progress. Efforts to enrich security analytics with other analytics — IT operations, business and risk management — appears to be plateauing. A year ago, 43% of organizations reported a significant level of integration across these sources; today the figure has fallen to 39%. (Another 35%, globally, report marginal integration.) There’s a distinct difference among global regions, with 45% North American respondents reporting significant integration, versus Europe and Asia-Pacific trailing at 35% and 36%, respectively.

The best explanation for the regression would seem to be the complexity of data and the difficulty in integrating disparate tools.

“There’s a lot of complexity that goes into developing good analytics,” SURGe leader Ryan Kovar notes. “The pandemic drove a lot of change and an explosion of new data sources. Just as orgs might have been getting a handle on that kind of analytics integration, they’ve got all this new data and are having to refactor everything.”

That said, vendors (including yours truly) are always looking to create more out-of-the-box ways to reduce complexity, helping organizations overcome any setback. To get back on track requires starting the processes from the beginning: defining integration goals; standardizing data, using pre-built detections that often come with security analytic solutions and, where possible, tools; and continuing to collaborate and build trust across teams and siloes.

> 63% reported each of the following benefits of DevSecOps: operational efficiencies; better cloud security; more secure, reliable software; a better, more proactive security posture.
> 59% reported fewer security incidents as a result of DevSecOps practices.

The State of Security 2023   |   Splunk 22

## Goals and Strategies
### From next-to-zero to resilience hero
We noted that security teams are increasingly seen as valued partners rather than boxes to check or obstacles to overcome. The result (or cause) is deeper collaboration at all levels. For an example at the grassroots level, DevSecOps is pretty much everywhere. Only 3% of respondents say their organization does not leverage DevSecOps practices, down from a 25% holdout rate the previous year.

At the leadership level, we noted that 91% of CISOs are collaborating with other leaders on resilience. Sixty-eight percent of CISOs meet with their boards either weekly (29%) or monthly (39%). Only 8% meet less than quarterly. And the top results of these meetings, according to respondents, have been:

## Recommendations
True organizational resilience lies not only with the security team’s crucial efforts to improve threat detection and incident response, but through holistic collaboration. In the organizations we’ve worked with, resilience has been strongest with a collaborative approach in which everything — from software development and infrastructure monitoring to business continuity planning — brings security leaders to the table with IT and business executives to protect the organization.

The theme of trusted partnership ran through our findings in this year’s survey, and when we look at how those most trusted organizations pursue their mission, certain recommendations emerge. The first four tie directly into the value of cross-organizational partnership.

1. **Use data and analytics to optimize threat detection and response.**
Security teams seen as enablers more often leverage analytics to identify cyber risks (38% versus 26%), improve threat detection (40% versus 25%), accelerate investigations (35% versus 27%) and automate remediation (38% versus 22%). As these teams’ efforts to build data-driven efficiencies across detection, investigation and response improve security operations results, they’ll likewise continue to elevate the security team’s status with the business.

2. **Plan for resilience.**
The “business enablers” are much more apt to report that their organization has a formal approach to cyber resilience, instituted organization-wide (32% versus 19% of those teams seen as roadblocks). This is essential
