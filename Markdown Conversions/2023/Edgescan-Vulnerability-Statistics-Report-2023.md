Welcome to the 8th edition of the Edgescan 
Vulnerability Stats Report 2023. This report 
demonstrates the state of full stack security 
based on thousands of security assessments 
and penetration tests on millions of assets 
that were performed globally from the 
Edgescan Cybersecurity Platform in 2022. 
This is an analysis of vulnerabilities detected 
in the systems of hundreds of organizations 
across a wide range of industries – from the 
Fortune 500 to medium and small businesses. 
The report provides a statistical model of 
the most common weaknesses faced by 
organisations to enable data-driven decisions 
for managing risks and exposures more 
effectively. 
We hope this report will provide a unique by-
the-numbers insight into trends, statistics, and 
snapshot of the overall state of cybersecurity 
for the past year, from the perspective of 
vulnerabilities discovered and remediated, as 
well as penetration testing success rates.  
We’re proud that this yearly report has become 
a reliable source for approximating the global 
state of vulnerability management. This is 
exemplified by our unique dataset being part 
of the Verizon Data Breach Investigations 
Report (DBIR), which is the de facto standard 
for insights into the common drivers for 
incidents and breaches today. 
This year we delve into Risk Density to 
describe where critical severity vulnerabilities 
and exposures are clustered in the IT 
technical stack, quantification of attack 
surface management exposures and risks, 
and Mean Time To Remediate (MTTR) critical 
vulnerabilities. 
We split our statistical models across layers 
of the technology stack (Full Stack) such as 
Web Application, API, and Device/Host layers. 
Additionally, we make a distinction in the 
data for four tiers of business sizes based on 
employee count and a distinction between 
internet facing and internally facing assets. 
We take a look at how quickly various 
vulnerabilities are being fixed based on 
risk. Unfortunately, we still see high rates of 
known (patchable) exploitable vulnerabilities, 
with working exploits in the wild being used 
by nation states and cyber criminal groups 
against organizations who are slow to patch. 
New in this report is the way we look at 
prioritization and risk scores. Since Edgescan 
employs a number of risk prioritization scoring 
mechanisms, we take a deeper look at the 
most common risks faced by organisations 
and also look at correlation of the various risk 
scoring methodologies. Some of the results are 
surprising and we hope you will stay to the end 
to learn more! 
Given Edgescan maps validated vulnerabilities 
automatically to ₁CVSS (Common Vulnerability 
Scoring System), ₂CISA KEV (Cyber Security 
& Infrastructure Security Agency Known 
Exploited Vulnerability Catalogue), ₃EPSS 
(Exploit Prediction Scoring System) and our 
own EVSS (Edgescan Validated Security Score), 
we have leveraged this information to provide 
a qualitatively better guide to what the most 
common risks faced by systems deployed in 
modern enterprises are. 

# Introduction

When we examine cyber posture from an attack 
surface standpoint, exposed services are a real 
risk. Statistically some vulnerabilities have a very 
low frequency of occurrence compared to the 
total number of vulnerabilities discovered, but 
many will result in a breach with an outsized 
impact, which we can call an intensive rather than 
extensive risk. 
Similarly to the 2022 report, patching and 
maintenance is a challenge and we still find that 
it is not trivial to patch production systems. The 
MTTR (Mean Time to Remediation) stats also 
reflect on this issue. Continuous detection and 
assessment needs improvement and as I’ve 
always said, visibility is paramount.  
Internal, non-public cyber security posture is 
significantly lacking in terms of resilience and 
ease of exploit. Combining vulnerabilities across 
the stack, in some cases, results in the potential 
impact being much more severe than the sum of 
the individual discovered vulnerabilities. 
Oddly, CVE’s dating from 2015 are still being 
discovered and are being used by ransomware and 
malware toolkits to exploit systems when they can 
find them.  
Attack Surface Management (Visibility) is a key 
driver to cybersecurity best practices and based 
on our continuous asset profiling, we discuss 
how common sensitive and critical systems are 
exposed to the public Internet far more than 
they should be. The assumption here is that 
enterprises simply do not have systems, people 
and processes in place, to make them aware of 
exposures in a manner that facilitates remediation 
actions. 
This report provides a global snapshot across 
dozens of industry verticals and how to prioritize 
what is important, as not all vulnerabilities are 
created equal.

# 2022 Year in Review
Non-internet facing systems have a significant risk 
density 
*   Our data indicates internal systems are less hardened 
than Internet facing systems (which is no surprise) 
and many feature prominently exploitable applications 
like Mozilla Firefox and Adobe with multiple CVE’s that 
are listed on the CISA KEV. For example, The Adobe 
vulnerabilities commonly found are listed on the CISA 
KEV and have an EPSS score of 86%. 
*   This “target rich environment” allows threat actors to 
easily pivot within a local network post initial-access 
(breach) at the perimeter.  
*   So called, “Shift-Left” security is not taking into 
account the live environment on which systems are 
deployed, resulting in undetected weaknesses in the 
overall network of systems. Systems being assessed in 
a “lab” environment are not reflective of the risks when 
deployed on the public Internet. 
Mean Time To Remediation (MTTR) for Critical Severity 
vulnerabilities is 65 days (across the full stack). 
And while this result is similar to previous years, industry 
reports estimate that adversaries are now able to exploit 
a vulnerability within 15 days (on average) of discovery1. 
One third of all vulnerabilities across the full stack 
discovered in 2022 were either High or Critical Severity. 
*   While credential theft and stuffing is the most 
common mechanism for exploitation and phishing 
is second, exploiting vulnerabilities is the third most 
common vector to breach an organisation (according 
to the Verizon DBIR). CISA recommends fixing critical 
severity vulnerabilities within 15 days and high severity 
vulnerabilities within 30 days.  Both secure development 
and continuous monitoring needs improvement, given 
that many of the high and critical severity issues seen in 
live environments are trivial to remediate. 
The most common application layer vulnerabilities are 
still Injection related, this also applies to API’s. 
*   We are still seeing vulnerabilities which are not 
particularly new or exotic, but are widespread and 
very effective in terms of successful breach. Many 
injection related vulnerabilities can be easily detected 
using automation if applied on a frequent basis and 
importantly, if assessment coverage can be assured. 
CISA KEV & EPSS combined are very useful in moving 
towards Risk Based Vulnerability Management (RBVM).  
*   Our report notes instances when EPSS and CISA 
KEV do not align. CVSS score alone does not provide 
adequate metadata to help make risk based decisions. 
A combination of CVSS, EPSS, CISA KEV, and security 
validation is required to deliver risk based prioritization2.    
Prioritization needs to take into account the criticality of 
the asset. 
*   Given limited resources, proper prioritization is key 
to success as noted in the report. Additionally asset 
criticality must be a factor in the prioritization calculus. 
Understanding which assets are business critical and 
combining that information with vulnerability scoring 
information, is an indicated path to achieving true Risk 
Based Vulnerability Management. 
Convergence of Vulnerability Management and 
Penetration Testing output is highly effective.  
*   Cybersecurity is perhaps more of a qualitative than 
quantitative effort. When identifying vulnerabilities in 
systems it is necessary to prioritize risks. However, 
prioritization alone is not sufficient, as we see when 
we layer in exploitability metrics with EPSS and EVSS, 
or when we also take into account asset value. Another 
level of validation needs to occur (like quality assurance 
of software releases) and that is essentially what 
penetration testing provides. Penetration testing is the 
qualitative proof, for security controls or exploitable 
vulnerabilities that should be remediated immediately. 
*   Combining intelligence harvested from both manual 
penetration testing (for depth) and vulnerability 
scanning (for frequency) – different means to the same 
end – can significantly help with prioritization and 
identification of risks. 
Oddly, many “PCI Fails” are essentially “false flags” not listed 
on the CISA KEV or having a high EPSS probability score. 
*   A PCI compliance failure may occur because a CVE 
has a CVSS score above 4.0, without having any known 
exploits in the wild or impact on real world security via 
penetration test validation. 
*   This leads us to conclude that Compliance and 
Security are certainly not the same. And unfortunately, 
compliance may be creating more harm than good by 
distracting from the real work of RBVM.

# Risk Density
The following is a breakdown of vulnerabilities 
by severity, discovered across the full stack; 
Web Applications, API’s and Network/Host 
deployments.
It also depicts the risks associated with 
potential PCI (Payment Card Industry) Failures – 
Not every vulnerability results in a PCI fail.
Severity is defined via the Edgescan Validated 
Security Score (EVSS). Later in the report we 
draw upon CVSS, CISA KEV and EPSS Risk and 
Probability scores.

Across the full stack more than 33% of 
discovered vulnerabilities were of a critical or 
high severity.

**Full stack**
*   Critical Severity 9.8%
*   High Severity 23.4%
*   Medium Severity 27.8%
*   Low Severity 39%

**Network**
*   Critical Severity 10.5%
*   High Severity 25%
*   Medium Severity 28.8%
*   Low Severity 35.7%

**Application**
*   Critical Severity 5%
*   High Severity 7%
*   Medium Severity 9.6%
*   Low Severity 78%

**PCI Failures**
*   Critical Severity 10%
*   High Severity 35%
*   Medium Severity 54%
*   Low Severity 0%

Across the Web application and API layers 12% 
of discovered vulnerabilities were of a critical 
or high severity.

35.5% of discovered vulnerabilities in the 
infrastructure/hosting/cloud/network layer were 
of a critical or high severity.

54% of PCI failures were of medium Severity.
Research indicates that such vulnerabilities will 
never be exploited, albeit they result in a PCI DSS 
compliance fail.

# Web Applications - Critical Severity Vulnerabilities
The Application Security Critical severity Top 10 
depicts the most common critical risk issues 
discovered by Edgescan over the past year. 
SQL Injection is still the main contender (as 
was in the 2022 report), which is interesting to 
note as we can easily develop code (or block 
vectors) to mitigate such attacks. Detection 
of such vulnerabilities is also trivial using the 
correct techniques.
Something which is overlooked quite frequently 
is “malicious file upload” at 22.7% of all critical 
vulnerabilities discovered. This can give rise 
to ransomware, malware and internal network 
breach pivot points for attackers.
Log4Shell (First discovered in late 2022) 
contributed to 5% of all critical severity 
vulnerabilities discovered this year. 
Authorization issues cover privilege escalation or 
access to restricted functionality which would 
result in a data breach.

| CWE       | Vulnerability                                | %      | On CISA KEV |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|
| CWE-89    | SQL injection                               | 23.4%  | Yes         |
| CWE-917   | Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)                  | 5%     | Yes         |
| CWE-94    | Spring4Shell                                | 5%     | Yes         |
| CWE-434   | Malicious File Upload                       | 22.7%  |             |
| CWE-79    | Cross-Site Scripting (Stored)               | 19.1%  |             |
| CWE-521   | Weak Password Policy                        | 1.4%   |             |
| CWE-285   | Authorization Issue - Privilege Bypass      | 7.8%   |             |
| CWE-200   | Database Console Exposure                   | 1.4%   |             |
| CWE-264   | PHP Multiple Vulnerabilities                | 7.1%   |             |
| CWE-35    | File path traversal                         | 1.4%   |             |

The most commonly found critical severity 
vulnerabilities across the application/web layer.  
“Critical Severity” vulnerabilities are defined by the 
Edgescan Validated Security Score (EVSS) which is a 
combination of analytics and expert validation.

*   **SQL injection** vulnerabilities arise when user-controllable data is incorporated into 
database SQL queries in an unsafe manner. An attacker can supply crafted input 
to break out of the data context in which their input appears and interfere with 
the structure of the surrounding query.  Various attacks can be delivered via SQL 
injection, including reading or modifying critical application data, interfering with 
application logic, escalating privileges within the database and executing operating 
system commands.
*   A remote code execution vulnerability exists in **Apache Log4j < 2.15.0** due to insufficient protections on message lookup substitutions when dealing with user controlled input. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this, via a web request to execute arbitrary code with the permission level of the running Java process.
*   This is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via data binding.
*   Uploaded viruses and malware could later be downloaded by users of the application. Such malware can cause partial or complete compromise of a network that the host resides on.
*   Stored attacks are those where the injected script is permanently stored on the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum, visitor log, comment field, etc. The victim then retrieves the malicious script from the server when it requests the stored information. Stored XSS is also sometimes referred to as Persistent or Type-II XSS.
*   Poor password controls such as no MFA, Default Credentials etc.
*   Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or performing a business function outside the users limits.
*   The Database console was accessible, and provides access to privileged functionality which should not be accessible, except by authorized users or networks. Access to the console could allow a malicious actor to execute SQL statements on the sever.
*   Multiple vulnerabilities pertaining to PHP patching.
*   This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

# Web Applications - High Severity Vulnerabilities
Broken Authentication/Brute forcing 
possible (14.7%) is high on the list for 
2022. This relates to misconfigured, 
broken logic, username enumeration or 
insecure authentication functionality.
Deserialization of Untrusted Data has also 
increased since 2021 (3.2%) to 9.4%.
As ever Cross-Site Scripting - XSS 
(Reflected) at 12.9% is a common 
vulnerability. Many browsers are getting 
better at protecting against such an attack 
vector, but not infallible. 

| CWE          | Vulnerability                                        | %      |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|
| CWE-307      | Broken Authentication/Brute Forcing/User enumeration | 14.7%  |
| CWE-200      | Administrative Functionality Exposed                | 7.6%   |
| CWE-434      | Malicious File Upload                               | 5.4%   |
| CWE-79, CWE-725 | Cross-Site Scripting - XSS (reflected)              | 12.9%  |
| CWE-643,CWE-91 | XML External Entity Injection (XXE)                 | 9.8%   |
| CWE-200      | Information Disclosure                              | 3.6%   |
| CWE-502      | Deserialization of Untrusted Data                   | 9.4%   |
| CWE-77       | Remote Command Injection                            | 3.1%   |
| CWE-285      | Insufficient Authorization                          | 8.5%   |
| CWE-1329     | Unsupported/Depricated System                       | 3.1%   |

The most commonly found high severity 
vulnerabilities across the application/web layer. 
“High Severity” vulnerabilities are defined by the 
Edgescan Validated Security Score (EVSS) which is 
a combination of analytics and expert validation.

*   Authentication in the application did not function correctly or it was possible to 
perform a brute forcing attack on the users of this web application. A common attack 
by malicious users is to attempt a number of different combinations of passwords, 
IDs or 2FA codes in order to gain unauthorized access to an account or user data.
*   Administrator consoles provide access to privileged functionality which should not 
be internet-accessible, except by authorized hosts or networks. Such web pag­
es occasionally suffer from known security weaknesses and must themselves be 
patched regularly. Password based attacks could also be used and if successful aid 
an attacker in compromising this host.
*   Uploaded viruses and malware could later be downloaded by users of the applica­
tion. Such malware can cause partial or complete compromise of a network that 
the host resides on.
*   Reflected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities arise when data is copied from a re­
quest and echoed into the application’s immediate response in an unsafe way. An 
attacker can use the vulnerability to construct a request which, if issued by another 
application user, will cause JavaScript code supplied by the attacker to execute 
within the user’s browser in the context of that users session with the application. 
*   XML injection which resulted in application compromise or forcing the application 
to perform functions not intended.
*   The application exposed unnecessary sensitive information. Types of information 
considered sensitive include: Internal IP addresses, Physical paths on the host, 
Detailed platform information, Domain Information, etc.
*   The application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the 
resulting data will be valid.
*   The application constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced 
input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neu­
tralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent 
to a downstream component.
*   Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended 
permissions. Applications were found with insufficient controls leading to unau­
thorized access of data or functionality.
*   An application component is no longer supported. If the component is discovered 
to contain a vulnerability or critical bug, the issue cannot be fixed using an update 
or patch.

# Web Applications - Medium Severity Vulnerabilities
Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) was 
significant allowing attackers to interact with 
arbitrary external resources. 
Cross-Site Scripting - XSS (reflected) at 19.1% is 
a common vulnerability whose prevalence does 
not seem to wane.

| CWE               | Vulnerability                            | %      |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------|
| CWE-79, CWE-725   | Cross-Site Scripting - XSS (reflected)  | 19.1%  |

| CWE-200           | Information Disclosure                   | 2.5%   |
| CWE-643,CWE-91    | Xpath Injection                          | 6.8%   |
| CWE-613           | Insufficient Session Timeout             | 2%     |
| CWE-644           | Host Header Injection                    | 1.8%   |
| CWE-1104,CWE-1329 | Vulnerable Wordpress Version             | 1.8%   |

The most commonly found medium severity 
vulnerabilities across the application/web layer. 
“Medium Severity” vulnerabilities are defined by 
the Edgescan Validated Security Score (EVSS) 
which is a combination of analytics and expert 
validation.

*   Reflected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities arise when data is copied from a re­
quest and echoed into the application’s immediate response in an unsafe way. An 
attacker can use the vulnerability to construct a request which, if issued by another 
application user, will cause JavaScript code supplied by the attacker to execute 
within the user’s browser in the context of that users session with the application. 
*   Poor password controls such as no MFA, Default Credentials etc.
*   Administrator consoles provide access to privileged functionality which should not 
be internet-accessible, except by authorized hosts or networks. Such web pag­
es occasionally suffer from known security weaknesses and must themselves be 
patched regularly. Password based attacks could also be used and if successful aid 
an attacker in compromising this host.
*   SSRF is an attack that abuses an application to interact with a privileged network 
or the server itself.
*   CORS, when misconfigured, can enable an attacker to bypass it and make the client 
browser act as a proxy between a malicious website and the target web application.
*   Unvalidated redirects and forwards are possible when a web application accepts 
untrusted input that could cause the web application to redirect to an arbitrary 
location.
*   When a failed log-in attempt is made, enumeration of the username can occur if 
the server returns a non-generic response.
*   The application exposed unnecessary sensitive information. Types of information 
considered sensitive include: internal IP addresses, physical paths on the host, 
detailed platform information, domain information, etc.
*   Similar to SQL Injection, XPath Injection attacks occur when a website uses user-
supplied information to construct an XPath query for XML data.
*   Insufficient session expiration by the web application increases the exposure to 
other session-based attacks.
*   Without proper validation of the host header, an application is vulnerable to a 
number of types of attack.
*   The version of the Wordpress deployed is known to be vulnerable.

# API - Critical and High Severity Vulnerabilities
An Application Programming Interface (API) is 
a way for two or more computer programs to 
communicate with each other. It is a type of 
software interface, offering a service to other 
pieces of software. API’s have become very 
popular but cyber security approaches to API’s 
have been lacking. Using a custom security tool 
built for API assessments is of key importance, 
as there are many differences between API’s and 
Web Applications.

*   SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, OS Injections, Code Injections, ORM based vulnerabilities, 
Parsers such as XML, Traversal based attacks.
*   The API does not restrict the number or frequency of requests from a particular API 
client. This can be abused to  make thousands of API calls per second, or request 
hundred or thousands of data records at once, resulting in a  Denial of Service 
condition. This weakness also enables arbitrary scraping of other parties API’s and 
violate fair usage agreements.
*   Weak authentication allowing compromise of authentication tokens or exploitation 
of common  implementation flaws to assume other user’s identity or bypass 
authentication completely, compromising systems ability to identify the client/user, 
compromises API security overall.
*   AKA insecure direct object reference (IDOR). As its name implies, the ability to 
directly access resources without privileges or authorization.
*   Exposure of all object properties of an API endpoint without consideration for use-
case or requirement. Exposure of sensitive data. 
*   API does not control which object attributes can be modified providing the 
potential for access to opaque data, outcomes or functions. This can be used 
to create new parameters that were never intended which in turn creates or 
overwrites new variable or objects in program code.
*   Admin or sensitive functions exposed in error to unauthorized clients resulting in 
data disclosure or privileged execution for unauthorized API clients. Could result in 
an overly large attack surface and unintended exposure risk.

# Vulnerability Severity - EPSS, CISA KEV, and EVSS
**What is EPSS?**
The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) is an open, data-driven 
effort for estimating the likelihood (probability) that a software 
vulnerability will be exploited in the wild. The EPSS model produces a 
probability score between 0 and 1 (0 and 100%). The higher the score, 
the greater the probability that a vulnerability will be exploited. 
https://www.first.org/epss/

**What is CISA KEV?**
CISA maintains the authoritative source of vulnerabilities that have 
been exploited in the wild: the Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) 
catalog. 
CISA strongly recommends all organizations review and monitor the 
KEV catalog and prioritize remediation of the listed vulnerabilities to 
reduce the likelihood of compromise by known threat actors.
https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities

**Edgescan Validated Security Score (EVSS)**
Every vulnerability discovered by Edgescan is validated via a 
combination of data analytics and human expertise, resulting in near 
false positive-free vulnerability intelligence. Once a vulnerability is 
validated is it mapped to both the CISA KEV and EPSS to assist with 
prioritization. All vulnerabilities in Edgescan (where applicable) have a 
EPSS, CISA KEV, CVSS and EVSS risk score.

# Internet Facing Vulnerabilities - Critical Severity
Looking at vulnerabilities from a full stack perspective, 
we list the most common critical severity vulnerabilities 
found on internet-facing systems. The % column on 
the far left is the percentage of all critical severity 
vulnerabilities discovered. The CVSS score are 
undoubtedly high but not all vulnerabilities are listed on 
the CISA KEV or have a high probability via EPSS.
Note which are listed on the CISA KEV and the 
corresponding EPSS Score – In some cases the EPSS 
depicts a low probability of exploitation but it being on 
the CISA KEV means it is/has been exploited.
