Rapid7’s research and managed services teams work side by side during 
emergent threats and cybersecurity incidents to uncover new forms of risk, 
shine a light on attacker behavior, and provide timely intelligence that helps our 
customers and the community strengthen their security posture. Our mid-year 
threat review draws from Rapid7 threat analytics and underground intelligence 
data to offer insight on exploit, attack vector, and security landscape trends 
from the first half of 2023.

*   Nearly 40% of incidents Rapid7 managed services teams saw in the first 
half of 2023 were the result of missing or lax enforcement of multi-factor 
authentication, particularly for VPNs and virtual desktop infrastructure.
*   Ransomware gangs claimed at least 1,500 victims worldwide in the first half 
of 2023, cementing their status as the dominant threat to global businesses. 
*   Rapid7 researchers have tracked more than a dozen widely exploited 
vulnerabilities so far in 2023. Both ransomware groups and APTs continue 
to exploit vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, particularly in security 
appliances, business email technologies, and enterprise file transfer products.
*   Dark web marketplaces are thriving, often offering a full menu of options 
to financially motivated threat actors — from zero-day exploits and stolen 
files to domain-level access to corporate networks.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## A Note on Security Maturity
Rapid7 security advisory services consultants conduct a number of security 
maturity assessments over the course of any given year. Most of these 
assessments are requested by organizations whose security programs are 
nascent, and therefore whose initial maturity is expected to be lower than that 
of businesses with more established programs. Even so, Rapid7 consultants 
have observed significant programmatic gaps across most assessments 
conducted over the past 18 months, with only a single organization so far 
in 2023 meeting our minimum recommendations for security maturity, as 
measured against CIS and NIST benchmarks. 

### 1H 2023 Average Security Maturity (NIST Benchmark)

*A bar chart is displayed. The x-axis is labeled "Control category" and has the following categories: Identify, Protect, Respond, Recover, Detect. The y-axis is labeled with values from 0.0 to 5.0. Two lines are plotted across the categories. The first line, labeled "Rapid7 minimum recommendation" is a horizontal line at 4.0. The second line, labeled "Average maturity", shows the following values for each category: Identify - 2.0, Protect - 2.0, Respond - 1.5, Recover - 1.0, Detect - 2.5.*

Growing cloud adoption and the reality of today’s mature, complex cybercrime 
ecosystem highlight the pressing need for global businesses to establish 
and measure foundational security program elements, such as inventory and 
asset management capabilities and a baseline vulnerability risk management 
program. As some of this report’s findings show, basic security hygiene (for 
example, enabling and enforcing multi-factor authentication) goes a long way 
toward mitigating risk from a wide range of threats, including attacks levied 
by highly motivated adversaries.

## Vulnerability Intelligence: 1H 2023
Rapid7 researchers tracked more than a dozen new vulnerabilities that were 
widely exploited over the first half of this year. Overall, more than a third of 
widespread threat vulnerabilities were used in zero-day attacks, which remain 
prevalent among exploited 2023 CVEs. 

Significant widespread threats from 2023 so far include (but are not limited to):
*   CVE-2023-0669: Fortra GoAnywhere MFT command injection
*   CVE-2023-29059: 3CX DesktopApp backdoor (supply chain incident)
*   CVE-2023-34362: Progress Software MOVEit Transfer SQL injection
*   CVE-2023-2868:  Barracuda ESG appliance command injection
*   CVE-2023-27350:  PaperCut MF/NG remote code execution
*   CVE-2023-28771: Zyxel ZyWALL/USG remote command execution
*   CVE-2022-47966: Zoho ManageEngine remote code execution 
*   CVE-2022-36537: ConnectWise R1Soft Server Backup Manager remote 
code execution
*   CVE-2023-3722: Avaya Aura Device Services remote code execution 

Rapid7 managed services teams have directly observed exploitation of most of 
the above vulnerabilities in customer environments. Our team has also observed 
multiple instances of Adobe ColdFusion CVE-2023-26360 exploitation, which 
may indicate that the vulnerability is being exploited more broadly than the 
“very limited attacks” Adobe disclosed in their advisory. 
5

## Other Exploited CVEs
*   CVE-2023-26360: Adobe ColdFusion improper access control
*   CVE-2023-20887: VMware Aria Operations for Networks command injection
*   CVE-2022-21587: Oracle E-Business Suite remote code execution
*   CVE-2023-47986: IBM Aspera Faspex remote code execution
*   CVE-2023-27997: Fortinet Fortigate heap-based buffer overflow 
*   CVE-2023-27532: Veeam Backup & Replication remote code execution
*   CVE-2022-44877: CentOS Web Panel remote code execution
*   CVE-2022-46169: Cacti command injection

As expected, Rapid7 managed services teams also continue to see exploitation 
of older vulnerabilities that remain unpatched. Two notable examples from 
1H 2023 are CVE-2021-20038, a Rapid7-discovered vulnerability in SonicWall 
SMA 100 series devices, and CVE-2017-1000367, a vulnerability in the sudo 
command that allows for information disclosure and command execution. 

Rapid7 researchers also disclosed vulnerabilities in Adobe ColdFusion and 
Fortra Globalscape Enhanced Managed File Transfer  products, both of which 
are likely to be future targets for attackers.

## Incident Response Trends: 1H 2023
Rapid7 incident responders have seen a 69% increase in caseload year over year 
in the first half of 2023. Anecdotally, we aren’t alone — industry partners and 
peers have mentioned similarly noticeable upticks in the number of incidents 
they’ve taken on. 

While continued ransomware prevalence and high-profile attacks play a part 
in this trend, plenty of the initial access vectors Rapid7 services teams have 
observed this year are old classics, like brute forcing or credential stuffing 
attacks on internet-exposed systems that don’t have multi-factor authentication 
(MFA) enabled.

*A pie chart is displayed. The chart is titled "H1 2023 Initial Access Vectors". The slices of the pie chart are labeled as follows: Vulnerability Exploitation - 27%, Insider Threat - 4%, Phishing Payloads - 13%, Other - 11%, Remote Access - 39%, Supply Chain Compromise - 6%.*

Nearly 40% of incidents Rapid7 managed services teams saw in the first 
half of 2023 were the result of missing or lax enforcement of multi-factor 
authentication, particularly for VPNs and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI). 
Vulnerability exploitation has also been a prevalent vector, and phishing attacks 
remain a reliable scourge of corporate networks. 

Eleven percent of incidents arose from a mish-mash of initial access vectors, 
including (but not limited to):
*   Cloud misconfigurations
*   SEO poisoning
*   Failure to eradicate threat actors during previous compromises

A small percentage of engagements concluded without a clearly defined attack 
vector, often because of missing logs or prematurely wiped data. The end of 
this report contains practical security guidance to mitigate against the most 
common types of attacks Rapid7 incident responders see.

## Ransomware: 1H 2023
The ransomware landscape during the first half of 2023 has been largely stable 
as far as the top groups operating in the space. The below diagram shows the 
number of ransomware incidents attributed to each of the top players as of 
late June 2023, based on leak site communications, public disclosures, and 
Rapid7 incident response data. 

Note: The number of incidents attributed to Cl0p in this chart is likely to be 
(significantly) low, since the group is still actively claiming new victims from 
their May 2023 zero-day attack on MOVEit Transfer. 

*A horizontal bar chart is displayed. The chart is titled "Incident Response Data". The y-axis is labeled with the names of ransomware groups: Vice Society, Black Basta, Akira, Medusa, Play, Royal, BianLian, Cl0p, LockBit, ALPHV/BlackCat. The x-axis represents the number of incidents attributed to each group. The values are as follows: Vice Society - 33, Black Basta - 46, Akira - 63, Medusa - 64, Play - 115, Royal - 122, BianLian - 133, Cl0p - 178, LockBit - 526, ALPHV/BlackCat - 212.*

Notably, this data does not take into account all the downstream organizations 
and individuals that have been indirectly compromised by ransomware incidents 
at upstream providers or partners. With groups like Cl0p habitually targeting file 
transfer technologies, which often means exposure of third-party customer or 
client data, we can expect that downstream victims will significantly outpace 
primary or direct victims in these types of attacks.

While the top ransomware players have remained stable over the first half of 
the year, new groups are also continuing to emerge. The Akira ransomware 
gang, which appears to have launched around the end of Q1, is one of this 
year’s more salient examples, having garnered more than 60 known victims 
despite only being active for a few months.

## EXPLOIT BROKERS 
AND THE DARK WEB
The prevailing demand for remote exploits in security appliances and network 
edge devices is evident in broker prices for zero-days in common enterprise 
brands. Below are the going rates for zero-day exploits on a well-known broker 
site (vulns-sec.com) as of July 2023:

*A dark web post offering a zero-day exploit is displayed. It is a screenshot of a dark web forum post with text and a logo.*

Even if exploit brokers hypothetically demanded 10x returns on these investments 
— say, by selling a zero-day exploit in one of these devices for $750,000 after 
acquiring it for a mere $75,000 — ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) outfits like 
Cl0p, who have reportedly extorted victims for hundreds of millions of dollars, 
could easily cover that cost with a single victim payment.

### Network Devices
| Device | Price |
|---|---|
| Juniper (RCE) | $75,000+ |
| Cisco (RCE) | $75,000+ |
| FortiNet (RCE) | $75,000+ |
| Citrix (RCE) | $75,000+ |
| Sophos (RCE) | $75,000+ |
| Sonicwall (RCE) | $75,000+ |
| F5 (RCE) | $75,000+ |
| HP (RCE) | $50,000+ |
| IBM (RCE) | $50,000+ |
| Huawei (RCE) | $50,000+ |
| ASUS (RCE) | $5,000+ |
| ZyXEL (RCE) | $5,000+ |

The potential profit margin for successful RaaS operations, in other words, is 
staggering. In all likelihood, a threat actor like Cl0p would easily be able to afford a 
bevy of zero-day exploits for vulnerable enterprise software — enabling the group 
to hoard and hone proprietary capabilities while they conduct reconnaissance on 
high-revenue targets. It’s not a theoretical use case, either; there are indications 
that Cl0p tested their zero-day exploit for MOVEit Transfer (CVE-2023-34362) 
for nearly two years before deploying it in a highly orchestrated attack over 
Memorial Day weekend this year. 

## Initial Access as a Service 
Buying zero-day exploits isn’t the only way for threat actors to gain access to 
target environments, of course. Business is booming for dark web marketplaces 
that sell access to compromised networks. Some of these marketplaces 
advertise revenue and size of victim companies alongside a guaranteed level 
of access — making it simple for ransomware groups to calculate how much 
a victim organization can afford to pay. 

*A screenshot of a dark web marketplace is displayed. It shows a website with various listings for access to compromised networks.*

The site below, for instance, is a relative newcomer to the dark web ecosystem: 
The takeaway, once again, is that profit-motivated cybercriminals stand to make 
outsized profits from even a single successful ransom negotiation.

## APT and State-Sponsored Activity: 1H 2023
Rapid7 researchers gather, analyze, and vet data from a wide range of sources 
for inclusion in a central threat library that supports Rapid7 products and 
services. The statistics and insights in this section are based on threat data 
from dark web forums, private messaging platforms (e.g., Telegram), and public 
reports in addition to intelligence from Rapid7’s own managed services teams. 

### State-Sponsored Threat Activity
Rapid7 researchers tracked 79 known state-sponsored threat actor attacks in 1H 
2023, at least 24% of which leveraged exploits against public-facing applications 
to target governments, critical infrastructure, and corporate networks. 23% 
of the state-sponsored attacks Rapid7 tracked used spear phishing to gain 
access to victim environments, and 22% involved the abuse of valid accounts. 

Motives across the groups we tracked include:
*   Cyber warfare: Campaigns where threat actors conducted attacks against 
infrastructure in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine
*   Cyber espionage: Campaigns aimed at gathering intelligence or intellectual 
property for political or economic advantage
*   Financial: Campaigns that target the private sector in order to evade economic 
sanctions and/or fund state regimes
13

The table below shows the most common MITRE ATT&CK techniques used 
in state-sponsored attacks over the first half of the year: 

| Rank | Initial Access | Execution | Persistence | Defense Evasion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application | T1059.001: PowerShell | T1574.002: DLL Side-Loading | T1574.002: DLL Side-Loading |
| 2 | T1566.001: Spear Phishing Attachment | T1053: Scheduled Task/Job | T1053.005: Scheduled Task | T1140: Deobfuscate / Decode Files or Information |
| 3 | T1566.002: Spear Phishing Link | T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter | T1078: Valid Accounts | T1036: Masquerading |
| 4 | T1078: Valid Accounts | T1204: User Execution | T1505.003: Web Shell | T1055: Process Injection |

### APT Vulnerability Exploitation
Much like financially motivated and commodity threat groups, advanced persistent 
threat (APT) actors targeted both new (zero-day) and known vulnerabilities in 
commonly deployed enterprise technology across the first half of the year. 

Unsurprisingly, major targets included routers, security appliances, print 
management software, and Voice Over IP (VOIP) solutions — in other words, all 
the usual network edge suspects in addition to business email and virtualization 
platforms. VOIP technologies in particular seem to be an underappreciated 
attack vector in traditional network security reporting; we expect to see these 
targeted more in the future. 
14

Older vulnerabilities have remained a functional part of many threat actors’ 
arsenals. While APTs have deployed exploits for newer vulns such as CVE-
2023-2868 (Barracuda ESG) and CVE-2023-27997 (Fortinet) thus far in 2023, 
the majority of attacks our team tracked have leveraged older vulns, including 
years-old flaws in Cisco IOS and Telerik UI. 

While APT attacks tend to garner more media and industry coverage, nearly 
all of the CVEs and techniques used in advanced attacks have also been used 
more broadly. For timely information on emergent threats and widespread 
attacks, see the Emergent Threat Response section of Rapid7’s blog.

## Practical Security 
Guidance 
The vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and threats detailed in this report can be 
considerably mitigated with basic security hygiene, including rigorous MFA 
enforcement and well-defined, risk-based vulnerability management procedures. 
A particular learning from the first half of 2023, however, is this: One of the 
most important ways organizations can mitigate catastrophic data theft and 
extortion risk in the face of a mature, highly motivated threat ecosystem is to 
put measures in place to prevent data exfiltration wherever possible.  

This includes (but is not limited to):
*   Alerting on or restricting unusually large file uploads; looking for large 
volumes of traffic to a single IP or domain
*   Monitoring for unusual access to cloud storage (ex: Google Drive, SharePoint, 
ShareFile)
*   Monitoring for or adding firewall rules to block known file sharing sites (ex: 
filetransfer[.]io, anonfiles[.]com, mega[.]nz)
*   Monitoring for data transfer utility presence or usage (ex: Filezilla, WinSCP/
Putty, MegaCMD, BITS, etc.)
*   Monitoring for data archiving utility presence and usage (ex: 7zip, WinRAR, 
WinZip, etc.)
*   Implementing egress filtering
*   Restricting local admin privileges on hosts
16

## Additional Security Guidance
Implement and harden MFA. Nearly 40% of incidents during the first half of 
2023 were the result of missing or inconsistent enforcement of MFA, particularly 
on VPN, VDI, and SaaS products. Rapid7 MDR has also observed an uptick in 
MFA push fraud as a result of notification fatigue. Many MFA vendors offer 
number matching as a way to prevent MFA fatigue.

Block .one at the perimeter or email gateway. Microsoft OneNote has been 
abused to spread malware and credential stealers, predominantly through 
phishing emails. This was the root cause of the majority of phishing incidents 
our team observed in 1H 2023. Read more [here](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/04/20/microsoft-onenote-phishing-attacks-on-the-rise/). 

Put network edge devices, including VPNs and file transfer appliances, on 
a high-urgency patch cycle. Network perimeter devices like VPNs, routers, 
switches, internet-facing load balancers, and more have been primary targets 
for attackers of all skill levels. These business-critical technologies are often 
an adversary’s doorway to corporate networks, and they frequently provide a 
jumping-off point for threat actors to pivot deeper into compromised environments. 
Critical vulnerabilities in these products should ideally be patched urgently, 
within hours or days wherever possible.

Focus on vulnerability management fundamentals. Today’s threats often 
demand that businesses invoke emergency patching and incident response 
procedures, but it’s impossible to clarify what qualifies as an emergency 
without an understood, accepted definition of normal. Clearly defined routine 
patch cycles should have measurable deadlines and results, and ideally should 
prioritize patching actively exploited vulnerabilities in addition to applying OS-
level and other important updates.
