THE 
CYBERTHREAT 
REPORT

June 2023Presented byInsights Gleaned from a Global Network of Experts, Sensors, Telemetry, and IntelligenceTHE CYBERTHREAT REPORT

Authored by Trellix’s Advanced Research Center, this report 
(1\) highlights insights, intelligence, and guidance gleaned from 
multiple sources of critical data on cybersecurity threats, and 
(2\) develops expert, rational, and reasonable interpretations of 
this data to inform and enable best practices in cyber defense. 
This edition focuses on data and insights captured between 
January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2023\. 

Cyberthreats continue to evolve and multiply. 
At speed and at scale. 

As SecOps teams race to defend information, 
assets, and operations, no single one of them has 
a full and complete view of the threat landscape. 

Why? Gaining perspective requires a broad 
horizon. Multiple sources. Streams of data. Raw 
intelligence. Massive volumes of telemetry. 

Real insight requires a strategic view across many 
organizations and industries. And regions. And 
attack surfaces. 

Welcome to the June 2023 edition of 
The CyberThreat Report.

The CyberThreat Report, June 2023

 
 
 
 
UNDERSTANDING THE RISKS, THREATS, AND VULNERABILITIES 
ATTACKERS ARE TARGETING – AND ACTIVELY HUNTING THEM

I spend a great deal of time speaking with board members, CEOs, 
CISOs, CIOs, CTOs, and other leaders responsible for the cyber defense 
of nations, governmental agencies, and private sector organizations 
across industries. 

We cover a wide range of topics – from global research, innovation, 
and intelligence to their SecOps teams’ latest cyber defense practices. 
We talk about their challenges, as Trellix recently documented in 
our Mind of the CISO thought leadership – e.g., too many different 
sources of information (35%), changing regulatory mandates and legal 
requirements (35%), growing attack surfaces (34%), a shortage of skilled 
staff (34%), and a lack of buy\-in and use from other parts 
of the company (31%).1 

Almost every one of these interactions, directly or implicitly, addresses 
the nature of the threat environment. What kinds of attacks are 
unfolding? What are the most impactful ransomware groups? 
Which vulnerabilities are targeted? Which nation\-states appear 
to be most active? What threat trends are we tracking in email and 
network security? 

“As a board member, CEO, CISO, CIO, CTO, or SecOps 
team member, this knowledge – shared in this report 
and across Trellix’s rich library of guidance, information 
and perspectives – is often critical to your mission.” 

At Trellix, we have a lot to share, because we are on the frontlines every 
day. We’re tapping into a massive reservoir of security intelligence, 
insights, and data gleaned from more than one billion sensors 
worldwide. As a board member, CEO, CISO, CIO, CTO, or SecOps 
team member, this knowledge – shared in this report and across Trellix’s 
rich library of guidance, information and perspectives – is often critical 
to your mission. 

My colleague John Fokker, who leads the threat intelligence practice 
within Trellix’s elite Advanced Research Center team, has compiled 
an excellent report here. Use these insights to help focus your team, 
tighten your processes, and get the right XDR technologies in place. 
And let us know where we can focus in future editions to help keep 
your organization safe, secure, and thriving.

IN SUPPORT OF CYBERSECURITY’S FRONTLINE HEROES

I work with heroes. I’m not referring to my team, though they’ve been 
viewed as having superpowers throughout their various public and 
private sector careers. 

I’m referring to you. I’m talking about the people and teams worldwide 
who rely on Trellix’s advanced research capabilities – our systems, 
insights, and intelligence – to protect your organizations from 
cyberattacks. CISOs, CTOs and CIOs, yes, as well as our colleagues 
at agencies like Europol, the FBI and NSA, the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Australia’s Cyber Security Centre 
(ACSC), and the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre 
(NCSC\-UK). Just as importantly – and perhaps even more so – I’m talking 
about every member of your SecOps team. 

“As you know intimately from your work every 
day, cybersecurity is evolving remarkably quickly. 
Breakthroughs in technology and a powerful 
shift toward XDR.” 

What do you think are game changers for your SecOps mission? 
According to the Trellix report my colleague Yossi mentioned above, 
cybersecurity leaders around the globe shared their point of view on 
these. They included better visibility (44%), stronger prioritization of what 
matters (42%), broader collaboration to address multi\-vector attacks 
(40%), and improved accuracy (37%).2 

Every one of these factors relies fundamentally on accurate insights, 
information, and data – like the contents of this report. 

As you know intimately from your work every day, cybersecurity is 
evolving remarkably quickly. Breakthroughs in technology and a 
powerful shift toward XDR. Shifts in regulation, from laws to liability. 
Changes in the threat environment. There’s a revolution under way, a 
transformation in how SecOps teams can stay “one step ahead” of the 
next generation in cyberattacks. Winning always starts with insights, 
with an understanding of our current state. 

We’re in this together. Trellix has your back. This report is for you.

INTRODUCTION 

Strategic Context: An Unsettled World 

Interpreting the data in this report requires understanding “the bigger 
picture” on a global scale. That’s because cyberthreats to organizations 
worldwide don’t occur in a technical vacuum. Among the major drivers 
of cyber risk are wars and other forces majeures, large\-scale shifts 
in economic cycles, and new vulnerabilities that can emerge any 
time a team introduces changes to factors such as business models, 
key partners, core processes, technology adoption, and regulatory 
compliance. A sampling of factors influencing our Q1 2023 threat data 
includes: 

Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine and Asymmetric Warfare Against the 
West: Cyberactivity for the purposes of espionage, warfare, and 
disinformation in service of political, economic, and territorial 
ambitions from major nation\-states continues to escalate. Hackers 
are levying increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks against Western 
businesses, governments, and infrastructure. 

Xi Jinping’s Consolidated Control over China and its Geopolitical 
Aspirations: China’s nationalist goals, assertive foreign policy, and 
corporate espionage practices continue to drive cyber risks as 
China\-affiliated advanced persistent threat (APT) groups dominate 
the global landscape. 

Developing Economies and Rapid Infrastructure Expansion: As many 
developing regions scale up infrastructure and technology as their 
economies grow, cybersecurity is often not top\-of\-mind – leading to 
many cyber\-related vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure. 

Global Inflation and its Economic and Political Impacts: This quarter 
included market volatility, financial and political crises, and pressures 
on spending priorities and cybersecurity budgets.

Continued Post\-COVID Supply Chain Disruptions: New paths to 
market across regions required shifts in partners, transportation 
networks, information sharing, and – by extension – cyber risk. 
Because cyberthreats are impacting the supply chain daily, the need 
for zero\-trust capabilities remains strong across industries. 

The Myth of Apple’s Superior Security Environment: This persists 
despite the fact MacOS environments can no longer be considered 
safe as threat actors start to leverage Golang\-based malware 
at scale and broaden attack vectors to cover numerous operating 
systems.

Artificial Intelligence Arrives on the World’s Stage, Promising 
Disruption: Cyber defense is helped and hurt by enhanced machine 
learning, natural language processing, and other advances. As 
global cyberthreats are evolving and occurring at a scale far faster 
than human teams can manage, artificial intelligence solutions 
become vital for enterprise cyber defense.

Cybersecurity: CISO Challenges and the SecOps Revolution

What is one of the most 

critical challenges for 

cybersecurity practitioners 

and SecOps teams? 

To digest threat intelligence 

intake – at speed and at 

scale – and push actionable 

insights immediately to 

threat\-hunting teams 

and task forces across 

organizations. 

Trellix’s goal? 

Simplify that journey.

How? By providing the 

level of automation to 

get to the responses that 

organizations need to 

focus on, using our superior 

threat intelligence, threat 

hunting and security 

operation capabilities 

embedded into our XDR, 

host protection, network, 

and mail products.

This year’s Q1 threat environment was also 
influenced by in\-house factors, many of 
which reflect ongoing headwinds confronting 
cybersecurity leaders and frontline teams. 

Outdated Technology: Many organizations 
continue to rely on legacy technology like 
SOAR and SIEM. In fact, 96% of CISOs 
say they need better solutions to protect 
their entity from cyber threats.3

Sea of Security Tools: SecOps teams 
are flooded with alerts and lack what 
they need to prioritize their time. On 
average, organizations employ a confusing 
array of 25 security solutions and tools.4

Alert Fatigue: Inundated with alerts, SecOps 
teams struggle with prioritization, false 
positive, and missed alerts. According 
to IDC, 35% ignore alerts – perhaps, in part, 
because 45% are false positives.5

Insufficient Resources: With limited SecOps 
resources and expertise, it’s hard to counter 
threats effectively. What’s the average SOC 
analyst tenure? Approximately two years.6 

Methodology: How We Gather and Analyze Data 

Trellix’s world\-class experts from our Advanced Research Center 
gather the statistics, trends, and insights that comprise this report from 
a wide range of global sources, both captive and open. The aggregated 
data is fed into our Insights and ATLAS platforms. Leveraging machine 
learning, automation, and human acuity, the team cycles through an 
intensive, integrated, and iterative set of processes – normalizing the 
data, analyzing the information, and developing insights meaningful 
to cybersecurity leaders and SecOps teams on the frontlines of 
cybersecurity worldwide. For a more detailed description of our 
methodology, please see the end of this report.

Application: How to Use This Information 

It’s imperative that any Industry\-leading assessment team 
understands, acknowledges and, where possible, mitigates the effect 
of bias – the natural, embedded, or invisible inclination to accept, 
reject, or manipulate facts and their meaning. The same precept 
holds true for consumers of the content. 

Unlike a highly structured, control\-base mathematical test or 
experiment, this report is inherently a sample of convenience – 
a non\-probability type of study often used in medical, healthcare, 
psychology, and sociology testing that makes use of data that is 
available and accessible. 

In short, our findings here are based on what we can observe and, 
pointedly, do not include evidence of threats, attacks, or tactics 
that evaded detection, reporting, and data capture. 

In the absence of “complete” information or “perfect” visibility, 
this is the type of study best suited to this report’s objective: to 
identify known sources of critical data on cybersecurity threats 
and develop rational, expert, and ethical interpretations of this 
data that inform and enable best practices in cyber defense. 

Central to this investigative ethic is the following: 

A Snapshot in Time: Nobody has access to all the logs of all 
the systems connected to the internet, not all security incidents 
are reported, and not all victims are extorted and included in 
the leak sites. However, tracking what we can leads to a better 
understanding of the various threats, while reducing analytical 
and investigative blind spots.

False Positives and False Negatives: Among the high\-performance 
technical characteristics of Trellix’s special tracking and telemetry 
systems to collect data are mechanisms, filters, and tactics that 
help counter or remove false positive and negative results. These 
help elevate the level of analysis and the quality of our findings.

Detections, not Infections: When we talk about telemetry, we talk 
about detections, not infections. A detection is recorded when 
a file, URL, IP address, or other indicator is detected by one of our 
products and reported back to us.

Uneven Data Capture: Some data sets require careful interpretation. 
Telecommunications data, for example, includes telemetry from ISP 
clients operating in many other industries and sectors.

Nation\-State Attribution: Similarly, determining nation\-state 
responsibility for various cyberattacks and threats can be very 
difficult given the common practice among nation\-state hackers 
and cybercriminals to spoof one another, or disguise malicious 
activity as coming from a trusted source.

The Road Ahead: Guidance and Resources

What does the information contained in this report mean for 
cybersecurity heroes on the frontlines? Cybersecurity insights and 
data are only useful if they are transformed into action – and result 
in lower risk, improved decision\-making, or more efficient or cost\-
effective SecOps activities. For additional guidance and resources,

Q1 2023 HIGHLIGHTS AT\-A\-GLANCE 

The Ransomware Landscape 

• The Ransomware Wave: Ransomware continues to be king as the 
 primary type of cyberattack across the globe. Socially engineered 
 ploys to deceive and manipulate individuals into divulging 
 confidential or personal information, such as phishing, are more 
 prevalent than ever even as they become more sophisticated.

• Cuba and Play Dominate: Though we observed a decline in ransom\- 

related cybercriminal activity at the start of the year, the most 
 prevalent ransomware families in Q1 were Cuba (9%) and Play (7%).

• LockBit Lingers: Despite a reduction in activity two quarters in a row, 
 LockBit continues to be the most aggressive ransomware in 
 pressuring its victims to comply with ransom demands. 

• Magecart Group Potentially on the Rise? Public reporting indicates 
this credit card theft and ecommerce scalping group’s activity in 
 Q1 2023 increased tremendously. This threat rarely operates at the 
 same scale of activity as the other major nation\-state\-affiliated APTs, 
 potentially indicating a re\-emergence of Magecart Group worldwide. 

Ransomware Tactics Evolving 

• Monetary Objectives: It’s unsurprising that the motivations for 
ransomware remain primarily financial; the insurance (20%) and 
 financial services (17%) sectors logged the most detections of 
 potential attacks. 

• Mid\-Size Businesses Most Impacted: Evaluation of our leak site data 
reveals the victims from these attacks are most commonly mid\-sized 
 businesses with only 51 to 200 employees (32%) and $10M to $50M in 

revenue (38%). 

• United States as Primary Target: The U.S. (15%) was the country 
 most affected by ransomware groups. It was also the country with 
the highest percentage of corporate victims (48%) who decided to 
“buy their data back” from the attackers – a rate six times greater 
than the next nation on the list, the United Kingdom.

• Cobalt Strike as the Weapon of Choice: Trellix telemetry identifies 

this tool as heavily favored by ransomware actors (28% of incidents). 
It appears to be growing in popularity and usage amongst these 
 groups despite vendor Fortra’s attempts in late Q4 2022 to make it 
 harder for threat actors to use it.

Nation\-State Red Flags

• Leading Actors: For the last six months, APT actors linked to China, 
including Mustang Panda and UNC4191, were the most active in 
targeting nation\-states in Q1\. China\-affiliated threat actors 

 dominated the global scene, generating 79\.3% of all nation\-state 
 activity, followed by actors tied to North Korea, Russia, and Iran. 

• Most Active APT Group: Mustang Panda persisted for the third 
 quarter in a row as the most active APT group worldwide (72%) – 
 denoting China’s continued and growing malicious cyber efforts for 

the purpose of espionage and disruption. 

Vulnerability Intelligence

• Failure to Address Known Vulnerabilities: Most of this quarter’s 
 most critical vulnerabilities consisted of known vulnerabilities not 
 yet addressed.

• Yesterday’s News: For a disclosed Apple vulnerability in February of 
this year, the bug had roots as far back as the FORCEDENTRY exploit, 

 which was used by NSO Group as part of its Pegasus spyware 
 disclosed in 2021\. 

Email Security

• New Avenues of Attack: Although Microsoft has started to block 
 macro attachments for the Office platform, threat actors have 
 quickly adopted other means of infections to continue targeting 
 Windows devices – such as SEO poisoning, OneNote, and 
 Zip attachments.

• Untrustworthy Brands: In addition to generic phishing emails, bad 
 actors are increasingly leveraging legitimate brand names 
 and services, like those from PayPal, Google, DWeb, and IPFS, to scam 
 victims and steal their online credentials.

Rogue Access to the Cloud

• A Shift in Tactics: Cloud infrastructure attacks continue to rise as 
 more and more businesses transition from on\-prem infrastructure to 
 more affordable and scalable options from Amazon, Microsoft, 
 Google, and others. 

• Valid Accounts: Though more sophisticated attacks with multi\- 

factor authentication, proxies, and API execution are ascendant, the 
 dominant attack technique continues to be through valid accounts, 
 at more than twice the frequency of the second most used attack 
 vector. This emphasizes that the risk of rogue access is real, as 
 cybercriminals access and sell legitimate account or website logins 

to infiltrate and conduct attacks.

REPORT ANALYSIS, INSIGHTS, AND DATA 

Security Incidents 

The security incidents discussed in this section are based on public 
reports. In the first quarter of 2023, windows binaries, third\-party 
tools, custom malware, and penetration\-testing tools continued to 
impact operations as threat actors exploited paths of least resistance. 
PowerShell and the Windows Command Shell continued to be abused 
to spawn tasks leading to persistence, deployment, and extraction. 

TOP WINDOWS BINARIES 
USED IN Q1 2023 EVENTS

1\. PowerShell 

2\. Windows CMD 

3\. Scheduled Task 

4\. RunDLL32 

5\. WMIC 

Scheduling tasks, inserting malicious 
DLL files, and commands executed 
through Windows management 
instrumentation rounded out the 
top 5\. Whether executing by scripts 
or manual keyboard entry, threat 
actors continued to make use of 
the unprotected and unmonitored 
binaries already at their disposal. 

In many cases, third\-party tools, 
freeware, and penetration testing 

tools play a role in an attack lifecycle assisting threat actors in setting 
persistence, running scripts, discovering and collecting targeted 
information and escalating privileges to access assets or data that are 
otherwise inaccessible to restricted accounts. Additionally, when used 
for privilege escalation, an attacker can run installation processes 
with elevated privileges and access areas, assets, or data that are 
otherwise inaccessible to restricted accounts.

The more nefarious third\-party tools such as Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, 
and Sharphound are used both legitimately and by threat actors to 
gather passwords, set beacons, or elevate privileges. Once an attacker 
compromises an environment, they can use file transfer tools such 
a cURL to access remote payloads, or Rclone to exfiltrate data to 
cloud storage. 

In the first quarter of 2023, the 
Magecart Group, APT29, and APT41 
were the three most active threat 
groups and APTs to target users by 
geolocation and sectors as methods 
to collect monetary value, uncover 
government secrets, or inhibit 
infrastructure use. We were surprised 
to discover that the Magecart Group 
topped the list as it rarely operates at 
the scale of the other major nation\-
state\-affiliated APTs. We will be 
monitoring the group’s activity 
in the months ahead to gauge 
whether the current period’s data 
signals the group’s re\-emergence on 
the global stage. 

Less sophisticated spray\-and\-pray 
techniques designed to snag anyone 
who might click or download plagued 
sectors in past global campaigns. 
Targeted attacks have evolved 
in sophistication, increasing in

events, both are equally important and organizations within them 
may not have reported a breach or remain unaware of an incident. 

Reported events analyzed and vetted 
by our research team contain a 
wealth of information, correlations, 
or attributions of an individual 
threat actor, a threat group, or a 
more sophisticated APT. The tools, 
techniques, and procedures along with 
malware families include loader and 
downloader malware, RATs, information 
stealers, and ransomware. In the Q1 
2023 events analyzed and available via 
Insights, we determined that Ukraine 
was targeted most frequently, followed 
closely by the U.S. 

The Royal Ransom, Trigona, and Maui 
ransomware families were the heavy 
hitters in Q1 2023\. Trellix recently 
published a detailed analysis of Royal 
Ransom and its inner workings with 
Windows and Linux executables. 
Although statistics represented 
emerged specifically from our 
Insights platform, many additional

The statistics displayed below are those of the campaigns, not the 
detections themselves. Our global telemetry revealed indicators of 
compromise (IoCs) belonging to several campaigns from various 
ransomware groups. 

It’s fairly common to see a drop in cybercriminal activity at the start 
of the year, especially in January. This trend could explain the notable 
decrease in activity for both Hive and Cuba. Furthermore, the FBI and 
Europol’s disruption of Hive’s activities in late January would have 
significantly interfered with their operations. LockBit continues to be 
a major family in the ransomware space – and is especially aggressive 
and seemingly successful at pushing victims to pay their ransoms.

Ransomware groups extort victims 
by publishing their information on 
websites referred to as “leak sites,” 
using the exposure to jumpstart stalled 
negotiations with victims or when 
payment of the ransom is refused. 
Our Trellix experts use RansomLook, 
an open\-source tool, to collect data 
from the posts, and then normalize 
and enrich the results to provide an 
anonymized analysis of victimology. 

It is important to note that not all 
ransomware victims are reported 

in the respective leak sites. Many victims pay the ransom and 
remain unreported. The metrics below are an indicator of the victim 
ransomware groups targeted for extortion or retaliation and should 
not be confused with the total number of victims.

Nation\-State Activity 

Insights on nation\-state group activity gathered from multiple sources 
create a better picture of the threat landscape and help reduce 
observation bias. First, we depict the statistics extracted from the 
correlation of nation\-state groups, IoCs, and Trellix customer telemetry. 
Secondly, we provide insights from various reports published by the 
security industry that are vetted, parsed, and analyzed by the Threat 
Intelligence Group. 

As noted above, these statistics are those of the campaigns, not 
the detections themselves. Due to various log aggregations, our 
customers’ use of threat simulation frameworks, and high\-level 
correlations with the threat intelligence knowledge base, the data is 
manually filtered to meet our analysis goals. 

We continue to see China\-affiliated threat actors dominate the global 
landscape, particularly with Mustang Panda driving a significant 
majority of detections in Q1 2023\. Since they rely heavily on sideloading 
and other techniques for stealth, it’s possible Chinese\-affiliated APT 
groups rotate their malware tools less frequently compared to other 
threat actors. If so, this practice could lead to “projection bias” or an 
inflated estimate of the detections of Chinese\-affiliated hashes.

India is one of the leading countries in Asia and neighboring regions 
with capable cyber programs. Some groups, predominantly China\-
linked threat actors, have demonstrated great interest in India’s 
technological, military, and political developments. A notable number 
of detections in India can be attributed to Mustang Panda.

Vulnerability Intelligence 

Trellix Advanced Research Center’s experts in reverse engineering 
and vulnerability analysis continuously monitor the latest vulnerabilities 
in order to provide guidance to customers on how threat actors are 
leveraging them and how to mitigate the probability and impact of 
these attacks. 

One of our most critical, but unsurprising, findings for 2023’s first 
quarter is many of this period’s most critical vulnerabilities consisted 
of bypasses to patches for older CVEs, supply chain bugs resulting 
from the utilization of outdated libraries, or long\-patched vulnerabilities 
persisting far past their expected five minutes of fame. 

Consider CVE\-2022\-47966 for example, a critical (9\.8\) vulnerability in 
Zoho’s ManageEngine products that made the rounds this January. 
ManageEngine is used by thousands of companies worldwide, so we 
weren’t surprised when exploitation of this vuln was detected in the 
wild. What astonished us was the root cause: utilization of Apache 
Santuario 1\.4\.1 – a version nearly old enough to vote – which contained a 

18

The CyberThreat Report, June 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
known issue allowing for XML injection. Zoho patched the vulnerability 
across its suite of products in October and then, almost three months 
later in Q1, CISA released an advisory warning of in\-the\-wild exploitation 
and urging vendors to patch. 

Another example is CVE\-2022\-44877, a critical vulnerability in Control 
Web Panel (CWP). Although not directly related, this vulnerability has 
many of the same characteristics as our previous example: it is another 
9\.8 RCE that saw widespread active exploitation in January despite 
being patched back in October. The root cause was not exactly Black 
Hat\-talk worthy, either: command injection using standard shell variable 
expansion in a URL parameter. 

A third example is CVE\-2021\-21974, a vulnerability in VMware ESXi’s 
OpenSLP service addressed back in February 2021, almost exactly 
two years before its sudden resurgence due to an in\-the\-wild 
exploitation. When we reported on this vulnerability in our February 
Bug Report, we noted around 48,000 internet\-reachable servers were 
still running vulnerable versions of ESXi according to Shodan. Today, 
that number is still over 38,000 – a change of less than 22%.

We found a few examples of our own when researching Apple devices 
earlier this year: CVE\-2023\-23530 and CVE\-2023\-23531\. These two 
vulnerabilities differ from the previous examples in that their impact is 
limited to local elevation of privilege and not RCE. This is not a reason 
to overlook their significance, however, as a very similar vulnerability 
was leveraged by the FORCEDENTRY exploit, which was used by NSO 
Group to deploy its Pegasus spyware back in 2021\. In fact, the two 
CVEs we uncovered utilize the same primitive that served as the basis 
for the FORCEDENTRY exploit: an innocuous class called NSPredicate. 
Unfortunately, Apple’s approach to mitigating FORCEDENTRY involved 
the use of an extensive denylist to shore up the ways NSPredicate 
was being abused – a mitigation which failed to address the 
underlying problem and allowed us to bypass it. 

It is tempting to point to trends such as these and conclude 
vendors don’t take security seriously or bemoan the regurgitation 
of old exploits by threat actors and researchers, but this isn’t the 
right takeaway. Vulnerability researchers engage in variant analysis 
because an effective vulnerability researcher emulates the priorities 
of real threat actors, and finding a mitigation bypass or an old CVE 
in a rarely patched product consistently produces better ROI than 

19

The CyberThreat Report, June 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reinventing the wheel. For organizations which rightfully recognize 
this trend, the takeaway should be this: while cutting\-edge threat 
detection technologies are irreplaceable in the modern threat 
landscape, many victories can be won on the fundamentals, such as 
patching processes and supply chain vetting. 

Email Security 

Email security statistics are based on telemetry generated from 
several email security appliances deployed on customer networks 
around the world. 

Phishing attacks that leverage legitimate brands to scam users and 
steal their credentials are on the rise, with DWeb, IPFS, and Google 
Translate heavily utilized in email attacks. Attackers also abused 
freemail and other comparable services, such as the two applications 
PayPal Invoicing and Google Forms, to mount vishing attacks and avoid 
detection. Similarly targeted during this period were new brands like 
Scribd, LesMills, and Google Play gift cards. 

Furthermore, in terms of the specific malware used for these attacks, 
Formbook and Agent Tesla both saw notable increases in Q1 2023, 
compared to late last year. This may be driven by the fact both pieces 
of malware are easier to acquire and deploy, compared to Remcos, 
Emotet, and Qakbot.
