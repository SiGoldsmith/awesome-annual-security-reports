2023
Cloud Security
Report

INTRODUCTION

In 2023, the cloud is fundamentally delivering on its promised business outcomes, including flexible 
capacity and scalability, increased agility, improved availability, and accelerated deployment and 
provisioning.

However, security concerns remain a critical barrier to cloud adoption, showing little signs of 
improvement in the perception of cloud security professionals. Cloud adoption is further inhibited by 
a number of related challenges that prevent the faster and broader embracement of cloud services, 
including the continued lack of cloud security talent, proliferating compliance requirements, and the 
significant lack of visibility and control, especially in hybrid and multi\-cloud environments.

This 2023 Cloud Security Report surveyed 752 cybersecurity professionals to reveal key challenges 
and priorities, including: 

• Cloud security continues to be a significant issue, with 95% of surveyed organizations 
concerned about their security posture in public cloud environments. Misconfiguration 
remains the biggest cloud security risk, according to 59% of cybersecurity professionals. 
This is closely followed by exfiltration of sensitive data and insecure interfaces/APIs 
(tied at 51%), and unauthorized access (49%).

• Despite economic headwinds, cloud security budgets are increasing for the majority of
 organizations (60%) by an average of 33%.

• 44% of organizations are looking for ways to achieve better visibility and control in securing 

hybrid and multi\-cloud networks, with 90% looking for a single cloud security platform to protect 
data consistently and comprehensively across their cloud footprint.

We would like to thank Fortinet for supporting this important industry research project. We hope 
you’ll find this report informative and helpful as you continue your efforts to secure your 
organization’s cloud journey against evolving threats.

Thank you,

WORKLOADS IN THE CLOUD

Despite a leveling out of cloud adoption year\-over\-year, the pace of moving workloads to the cloud 

remains strong. Today, 39% of respondents have more than half of their workloads in the cloud, while 

58% plan to reach this level in the next 12–18 months.

MULTI\-CLOUD ADOPTION

As workloads move to the cloud, organizations are selecting the cloud platform that’s the best fit for each 

project. This is driving multi\-cloud proliferation with nearly seven out of 10 companies in our survey using 

two or more cloud providers (69%).

BARRIERS TO CLOUD ADOPTION

While the cloud offers important advantages, significant barriers to cloud adoption still exist. The biggest 

challenges organizations are facing are not primarily about technology, but people and processes. Most 

critical is the perennial lack of qualified staff (37%), which continues to be the largest impediment to 

faster adoption, despite dropping slightly from last year. This is closely followed by legal and regulatory 

compliance (30%), data security issues (29%), and integration with existing IT environments (27%).

KEY CLOUD BENEFITS

After years of cloud adoption, do organizations believe cloud computing is delivering on its promise? The 

answer is yes. Cloud users affirm that the cloud is delivering key business benefits, including flexibility 

and scale (53%), agility (45%), business continuity (44%), and accelerated deployment and provisioning 

(41%). This is the first year that accelerated deployment has made it into the top four, leapfrogging both 

performance and the move to variable OpEx.

CLOUD BUSINESS OUTCOMES

The benefits of the cloud are driving key business outcomes, and this year responsiveness to customer 

needs (52%) becomes the top outcome instead of accelerated time to market (48%). Organizations that 

are smart about integrating cybersecurity into their move to the cloud are also seeing its value to the 

business in lower risk and improved security (42%) and in cost reductions (41%).

PUBLIC CLOUD 
SECURITY CONCERNS

Despite increasing cloud adoption, cloud security concerns show no signs of improving. Virtually all 

surveyed organizations are moderately to extremely concerned about their security posture in public 

cloud environments (95%). The number of organizations that are extremely concerned about public 

cloud security even increased this year — 35%, up from 32%.

RISK OF A BREACH

Concerns about public cloud security, combined with a lack of resources and expertise, are driving 

the perception that the risk of a security breach in the public cloud is higher than in traditional on\-

premises environments (43%). Only 27% of security professionals perceive risk to be lower in a public 

cloud environment.

OPERATIONAL SECURITY 
HEADACHES

Cybersecurity professionals face numerous challenges when it comes to protecting cloud workloads. 

The people factor again sits at the top of the list, lack of qualified security staff (43%), closely followed 

by compliance (37%). Multi\-cloud proliferation is almost certainly the reason behind the headache of 

delivering consistent security policies (32%).

VisibilityMULTI\-CLOUD SECURITY 
CHALLENGES

Multi\-cloud environments increase the complexity and challenges of securing cloud workloads. The 

people factor and the expertise that multi\-cloud environments demand is clearly highlighted in the fact 

that three out of the four top challenges are related to having the right skills, along with an in\-depth 

understanding of each cloud platform.

CLOUD SECURITY THREATS

Which cloud security threats keep cybersecurity professionals up at night? The same top four as 

last year, with misconfiguration continuing to hold the top spot, according to 59% of cybersecurity 

professionals. This is closely followed by the exfiltration of sensitive data and insecure interfaces/APIs 

(tied at 51%), and unauthorized access (49%).

Security professionals are using their cloud budgets wisely to address the threats and concerns that 

pose the biggest risk to the business. It may be no surprise that preventing misconfiguration is the 

number one priority (51%), but securing applications that have already moved to the cloud is a close 

second (48%).

KEY DRIVERS FOR 
CLOUD\-BASED SECURITY

The cloud allows organizations to get the same advantages for their security services as they have for 

their applications and workloads. This includes better scalability (56%), faster time to deployment (48%), 

reduced effort around patches and upgrades of software (43%), and cost savings (40%).

SINGLE CLOUD SECURITY 
PLATFORM

In light of the challenges regarding security visibility and lack of cyber talent, it comes as no surprise 

that the vast majority of respondents (90%) consider it moderately to extremely helpful to have a single 

cloud security platform and dashboard to protect data consistently and comprehensively across their 

cloud footprint.
