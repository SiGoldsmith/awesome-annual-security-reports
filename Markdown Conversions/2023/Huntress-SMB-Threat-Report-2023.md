The contents of this report reflect the notable adversarial 
behaviors, tradecraft, and trends we saw over the third 
quarter of 2023. Our aim is for this report to serve as your 
resource to understand, adapt to, and take action against 
the threats that target SMBs and those who protect them.

While the world of cybersecurity often revolves around high-profile breaches and larger 
enterprises, this report stands apart with a unique mission: to prepare small and medium-
sized businesses (SMBs) against the evolving tides of cyberthreats. At Huntress, we believe 
in empowering SMBs and the managed service providers (MSPs) who defend them with the 
knowledge, strategies, and tools needed to effectively protect themselves.

In the past quarter, the Huntress team witnessed a continuing shift in the nature of threats 
against SMBs. Threat actors have largely moved away from malware-focused tactics. Instead, 
threat actors focus on non-malware mechanisms and abuse of legitimate tools and system 
commands in most incidents. Notably, 56% of recorded incidents in this time frame were, in 
essence, “malware free” across multiple types of intrusions. Of particular note is the increasing 
use of remote monitoring and management (RMM) software as an avenue of intrusion. In 65% 
of incidents, threat actors used RMM software as a method for persistence or remote access 
mechanisms following initial access to victim environments.

## Executive Summary

SMB Threat Report

These trends are concerning, especially within the managed service provider (MSP) space. IT 
administrators, who rely on the same techniques and software that are now favored by threat 
actors, face an increasingly complex conundrum—distinguishing “good” from “bad” becomes 
a much more difficult task than it has been historically. Consequently, this may introduce an 
immediate need to move toward more behavior-based threat identification and a heightened 
focus on monitoring seemingly “legitimate” commands and software.

Furthermore, the migration toward cloud platforms and similar developments have placed an 
even greater premium on securing identities. Whether leveraged as an initial access mechanism 
through credential capture and replay, or for inbox access for information gathering, adversaries 
have migrated to cloud services along with end users to facilitate operations ranging from 
information theft to business email compromise (BEC) to pre-ransomware operations. Thus, 
MSPs and system owners need to extend their own visibility and security awareness beyond the 
traditional network perimeter to encompass external services and providers, as well as to fully 
capture the scope of identity-based actions and potential intrusions.

The following research reveals that the cybersecurity landscape for SMBs in Q3 2023 calls for a 
profound reassessment of defense strategies. The dominance of non-malware tactics, coupled 
with the exploitation of RMM software and identities, necessitates a nuanced approach to threat 
detection and response and expanding one’s security purview beyond conventional perimeters.

## Quarterly Summary
Reported items were distributed across Huntress monitoring mechanisms: Managed Endpoint 
Detection and Response and (increasingly) Managed Detection and Response for Microsoft 
365. This multi-pronged approach to security monitoring and response enables Huntress to review 
adversary operations across the attack lifecycle—from initial access and exploitation, through 
lateral movement and persistence mechanisms, to final adversary actions in victim environments.

Through further analysis and refinement, Huntress researchers were able to discern overall trends 
in the threat landscape facing SMBs—a sector typically overlooked or ignored in threat reporting. 
Huntress researchers identified several notable trends in adversary operations facing the SMB 
space:

In Q3 2023, 40% of incidents responded to by Huntress 
analysts were categorized as “high” or “critical” in severity.
* Decreased reliance on custom tools and especially 
malicious binaries in intrusions until final actions, such 
as ransomware deployment. As a result, many classic 
mechanisms for identifying or mitigating threats (such 
as pure anti-malware solutions) are less effective for 
countering intrusions.
* Increased reliance on malicious use of legitimate 
commands and tools, with particular emphasis on 
RMM software. The shift to RMM (as well as built-in 
system commands) means greater emphasis must be 
placed on behavioral analysis of adversary operations 
for detection and response.
* A highly diversified ransomware ecosystem including 
many families and strains that do not appear to impact 
many enterprises or similar entities, but are commonly 
found in the SMB space. This includes a diverse 
ecosystem of ransomware entities beyond “headline” 
entities and many commodity strains that are often 
dismissed in large enterprise security models.

## Intrusion Trends
Huntress focuses on defending the SMB—the organizations that are below the enterprise level 
and represent 99% of businesses in the US—and thus maintains distinct visibility from most other 
security firms. Within this visibility, we have identified continuing trends towards “living off the 
land” binaries (LOLBins) and credential compromise activity in Q3 2023. While custom or outright 
malicious tools still feature in events, adversaries are largely seeking to “blend in” to legitimate 
network operations through multiple mechanisms to evade detection and response.

At the SMB level, LOLBin use is especially concerning given the state of monitoring and review for 
many organizations. Many critical entities—from local school districts to medical offices—may find 
themselves at best leveraged for cryptomining or botnet purposes, and at worst, the victims of 
disruptive ransomware.

Figure 1 shows the distribution of tool “types” observed in Huntress-identified incidents, 
differentiating between compiled malware (e.g., a malicious EXE file), the use of scripting 
frameworks (such as PowerShell) for malicious activity, and the use of LOLBins and legitimate tools 
(including RMM software). While malware represents a significant portion of overall activity (44%), 
the remaining 56% of incidents are effectively “malware free.” Huntress thus observes a majority 
of incidents featuring LOLBin or similar abuse, or leveraging built-in scripting frameworks for 
actions.

The weaponization of legitimate tools, such as RMM tools in particular, remains an interesting and 
increasingly popular item in adversary arsenals. As reported by CISA and others, RMM abuse is 
increasingly popular in intrusions for several reasons:

56% of incidents were “malware free,” meaning 
adversaries opted for exploiting scripting frameworks or 
legitimate tools in place of malicious software.
* The applications in question are legitimate software, thus evading anti-malware solutions.
* Many organizations already run RMM software, allowing adversaries to “blend in” to the 
environment.
* RMM tool use is not typically audited, especially in small organizations, allowing for multiple 
RMM frameworks to be observed in the same environment. This diffusion of tools defeats 
potential detections, such as identifying a “new” RMM framework different from an existing 
baseline.

SMB Threat Report

From Huntress observations, RMM and remote access 
tools are distributed among several frameworks, with 
ConnectWise ScreenConnect figured most prominently, as 
seen in Figure 2 below.¹ 
Adversary choice of RMM tool, while interesting for trend 
analysis, is not necessarily as significant as the fact that 
adversaries are deploying some form of RMM in intrusions. In 
some cases, Huntress has observed adversaries diversifying 
among several RMM tools, such as using a combination of 
commercial and open-source items, to ensure redundant 
access to victim environments. Therefore, monitoring RMM 
tool use and deployment within defended or managed 
environments is an increasingly important security hygiene 
measure to ensure owners and operators can identify 
potential malicious installations.

RMM, or remote monitoring 
and management, IT 
software that helps MSPs 
proactively locate, update, 
and monitor client endpoints.

¹ While ConnectWise ScreenConnect, AnyDesk, TeamViewer, and 
NetSupport are not technically RMMs, for simplification we are aligning 
with CISA’s categorization of these and similar tools.

*A pie chart showing the distribution of observed RMM tools. The chart is divided into five sections: "ConnectWise" (56%), "AnyDesk" (18%), "NetSupport" (13%), "TeamViewer" (3%), and "Other" (10%).*

## Identity-Focused Security
In Q3 2023, Huntress began rolling out its MDR for Microsoft 365 service. Even through initial trials 
and roll-out, Huntress has already observed a number of concerning trends in identity-based 
intrusions and manipulation, leading to actions such as mailbox manipulation and outcomes such 
as BEC. Unfortunately, data is not yet complete to enable trend analysis, but Huntress anticipates 
Microsoft 365 and related cloud targeting to continue growing as a concerning and popular 
intrusion vector through Q4 and into 2024.

IT and business operations currently witness a growing importance 
of securing digital identities. Adversaries have set their sights on 
cloud services and identity-based attacks for initial access and the 
perpetration of fraud, such as business email compromise (BEC). 
These tactics have emerged as a favored intrusion vector for threat 
actors, and therefore should become a top priority for SMBs.

SMB Threat Report

Reviewing identified incidents, as seen in Figure 3, Huntress observes an overwhelming 
emphasis on identity-focused malicious activity. Identity is something to be stolen, spoofed, or 
manipulated—and adversaries increasingly focus on precisely these mechanisms. Primarily, we’ve 
seen a greater concentration on manipulating or compromising communication channels, such as 
setting up malicious forwarding or other inbox rules, which make up 64% of observed Microsoft 
365 incidents. Other activity includes attempting to compromise accounts, as seen in 24% of 
cases with logons from unusual or suspicious locations. 

While the ultimate goal of such activity remains, in most cases, BEC, defensive visibility and 
adversary kill-chain dependencies mean these actions are largely caught at the account 
takeover (ATO) phase of operations.

Although ATO and related events present difficult detection and monitoring problems for analysts, 
Huntress has identified several methods to leverage anomalies in observed logon activity to 
detect malicious behaviors. In several instances, Huntress was able to identify intrusions in 
progress through analysis of User Agent strings associated with Microsoft 365 login activity, 
using anomalous values to surface threat actor activity. 

*A pie chart showing the distribution of Microsoft 365 incident types. The chart is divided into four sections: "Suspicious Inbox Rule" (47%), "Suspicious Logon Location" (24%), "Suspicious Forwarding" (17%), and "Other" (12%).*

## Adversary Tooling & Behaviors
Trends in adversary activity—both the specific tools leveraged in intrusions and the more 
general behaviors that these items support—are critical in mapping the threat landscape. 
Identifying commonalities in adversary tradecraft as well as the convergence of operations 
on increasingly standard techniques can be of great value to defenders in orienting visibility 
and threat detection.

Our research has illuminated the diverse spectrum of adversary 
tactics used today; including a significant reliance on the abuse 
of scripting frameworks, credential theft, and the exploitation of 
legitimate remote access software.

12
SMB Threat Report

Using the MITRE ATT&CK framework, 
Figure 4 shows the behaviors most often 
observed in Huntress-detected incidents 
for Q3 2023. Notably, in one quarter 
(25%) of incidents, abuse of scripting 
frameworks (T1059) shows continued 
adversary reliance on built-in tools such 
as PowerShell, WMI, and related items 
for intrusion operations, amplifying the 
earlier observation on increased use 
of alternatives to compiled malicious 
binaries. 

While representing a smaller fraction 
of overall incidents, Huntress response 
identifies nearly all intrusions (i.e., 
multiple incidents or compromised hosts 
can exist within a single organization’s 
intrusion) feature credential capture 
in some fashion or at some phase of 
adversary operations. Operating system 
credential dumping (T1003) remains 
a critical component of the adversary 
intrusion lifecycle, with entities typically 
leveraging multiple possible techniques 
to access user credentials to enable 
lateral movement and remote process 
execution in victim environments. As 
described later in this report, migrating 
from single-factor authentication 
mechanisms to more robust multi-factor 
authentication (MFA) applications, 
especially for sensitive accounts such 
as domain administrators, is a critical 
security control to reduce attack 
surfaces and stymie adversary  
“break out.”

The behaviors listed are: "Command and Scripting Interpreter" (25.3%), "Other" (20.7%), "User Execution" (9.1%), "Native API" (8.0%), "Remote Access Software" (7.4%), "OS Credential Dumping" (6.4%), "Ingress Tool Transfer" (6.1%), "Process Injection" (6.1%), "System Network Configuration Discovery" (4.2%), "Remote Services" (3.6%), and "Software Discovery" (3.2%).*

As part of investigations as well as an integral feature of Huntress’ Managed EDR product, 
Huntress gathers antivirus (AV) detections in addition to analyst identification of malicious 
software or related tooling. While AV detections for the identification of specific malware 
types can sometimes lead to incomplete or misleading results, analyzing overall trends based 
on functionality and malware type or classification can be enlightening to identify patterns in 
adversary use and activity.

The coordinated takedown of Qakbot in Q3 2023 represents one of the more significant events 
in the identified time period and is partially reflected in Huntress data. Of note, Huntress clients 
have been protected against Qakbot infections since late 2022 through the use of a “vaccine” 
approach to interrupt malware execution. While Qakbot has essentially been neutered from full 
execution, Huntress still observes its delivery and attempted execution, indicating its prevalence 
in the wild. 

As shown in Figure 5, we have observed a declining number of Qakbot-related incidents over 
2023, with approximately half as many events in Q3 as in Q1. While “zombie” distribution is likely 
to continue for some time, Huntress anticipates this to drop even further in Q4 to the point of near 
eradication.

SMB Threat Report

Aside from specific tool deployment, Huntress focuses significant research efforts on post-
intrusion access tools. This perspective provides excellent insight into the tools and behaviors 
favored by adversaries once they gain access to a victim’s environment. While items like Qakbot 
may recede, it is hardly alone in the information security landscape, and will rapidly be supplanted 
by other frameworks. Interestingly though, as seen in Figure 6 showing the identified applications 
in incident reporting, Huntress observations of post-intrusion tooling are heavily skewed toward 
legitimate applications.

The abuse of legitimate remote access software (T1219) for persistent access to victim 
environments is heavily observed in available data. Huntress identified RMM applications in the 
majority of incidents (65%) either installed by threat actors or abused by them after capturing 
credentials. RMM abuse is supplementing or replacing the use of other frameworks, such as 
Cobalt Strike Beacon or Metasploit Meterpreter, in adversary operations. Additionally, RMM 
abuse offers adversaries the benefit of blending into legitimate remote administration activity 
and evading anti-malware security tools. Note that this view only covers those instances where 
applications were used to further an intrusion, while a number of incidents—nearly one third of 
the total as previously discussed—involve mechanisms such as LOLBins and credential capture to 
achieve adversary objectives.

*A pie chart showing the breakdown of post-intrusion access tools observed. The chart is divided into five sections: "RMM" (65%), "Cobalt Strike Beacon" (20%), "Quakbot" (9%), "Meterpreter" (3%), and "IcedID" (3%).*

Aside from intermediate tooling, 
ransomware continues to be a scourge 
across all organizations, from small 
businesses to large enterprises. Yet 
the small business perspective is 
interesting in providing a unique insight 
into ransomware affiliate or family 
deployment, which at times diverges 
from what is observed in enterprise 
networks. As seen in Figure 7, LockBit 
accounts for the majority of known-
variant ransomware deployments 
observed by Huntress (25%). However, 
a long tail of uncategorized, unknown, 
or “defunct” (i.e., strains assessed to no 
longer be actively deployed) make up 
the majority of all identified ransomware 
events (60%).

While some new families continued 
to emerge in Q3 2023, such as INC 
Ransomware and Akira, the overall 
outlook from the SMB perspective is on 
existing strains and, except LockBit, less 
well-known affiliates.

## Adversary Trends
Adversaries continue to leverage a consistent triad of initial access techniques: user-targeted 
phishing activity, credential theft and replay, and external-facing system or application 
exploitation. Some of these can be combined together (e.g., credential phishing activity to 
acquire logon information, followed by replay against systems not enforcing multifactor logins), or 
deployed independently at scale (e.g., MoveIT exploitation activity earlier in 2023).

One of the key themes of Q3 2023 is an emphasis on “hot zero day summer”—a series of 
vulnerabilities disclosed in external-facing applications (such as MoveIT) or systems (such as 
VPN concentrators, firewalls, or email security gateways) enabling adversaries to rapidly 
establish presence in victim environments. Huntress, as a managed security vendor emphasizing 
system endpoint visibility, is seldom directly involved in the first phases of such intrusions, as they 
take place against dedicated appliances with custom operating systems and similar limitations. 
However, Huntress frequently observes the follow-on impacts of such activity, where an exploited 
externally-facing system becomes “patient zero” for subsequent lateral movement in the victim 
environment.

While garnering significant attention, adversaries do not rely on vulnerabilities alone for initial 
access. Phishing and end-user targeting remain common and widespread tactics for threat actors 
ranging from ransomware affiliates to BEC operators. Yet the nature of such phishing has shifted 
significantly since Microsoft disabled macro execution by default in Microsoft Office as well 
as earlier “Mark of the Web” security controls implemented for Visual Basic for Applications 
(VBA) scripts.

Phishing and end-user targeting remain common and 
widespread tactics for threat actors ranging from 
ransomware affiliates to BEC operators.

### Adversary Trends

As a result, adversaries continue to look for new payload mechanisms to deliver malicious 
content to end users. Interestingly, many of these methods require significant user interaction for 
successful execution. Huntress observes this trend with payloads landing on victim machines such 
as ZIP or ISO archives containing malicious LNK or scripting objects, requiring multiple interactions 
from victims from initial delivery to execution.

In other instances, adversaries leverage new access vectors to interact with end users. For 
example, TrueSec published on activity leveraging Microsoft Teams for distributing phishing 
links in early September 2023. Huntress identified similar activity between September 6–8, 2023, 
leveraging LNK objects masquerading as PDFs to encourage user interaction, resulting in the 
installation of DarkGate malware. Examples of payloads include the following objects:

| File Name                                   | SHA256


