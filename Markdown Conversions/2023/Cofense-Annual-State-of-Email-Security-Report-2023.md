LETTER FROM THE CISO

As I transition from behind the scenes of this report, I wanted to take 

a moment to share some of my thoughts on what we’ve seen over 
the past year. Taking on the role of CISO has added some additional 
insight as I stepped back into the role of practitioner again. Now 

that I review our cyber insurance and 3rd party questionnaires, it has given 
me perspective into why organizations have started asking more questions 
about simulation metrics. 

Something that hasn’t changed over the last year, your SOC still needs HELP! As teams continue 
to deal with workforce shortages, remote work and burnout, optimizing processes and automation 
are even more critical to defend the perimeter. As I’ve spent time with incident responders and 
attended conferences to hear from practitioners, it’s clear the community demands products 
and solutions to integrate together rather than stand\-alone products. It’s this reason that we’ve 
continued to enhance our APIs, while also expanding our integration partnerships, allowing you to 
quickly identify threats hitting the inbox and moving those IOCs to your other controls to defend 
against the adversary quickly. 

Have you followed the trend of adding a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team? We continue to hear 
from customers that are building out teams to become more proactive in defending against the 
threat landscape. But adding more threat feeds isn’t productive – or helping your SOC automation. 
This is why we have stood firm on our “human\-vetted” intelligence, to ensure you can depend on 
adding IOCs to your automation. It’s more critical than ever to ensure your intelligence feeds are 
actionable intelligence allowing you to reduce noise and provide context to those alerts. 

As I think about the conversations I’ve had with SOC teams, it’s become clear they have a love\-
hate relationship with the reporting of suspicious emails versus employees just deleting them. 
Our intelligence is enriched because users report suspicious emails. The SOC can benefit from 
those suspicious messages being reported by extracting the IOCs and taking action to mitigate a 
threat. However, the button that is often used is the “delete” button by the user who is just flat\-out 
annoyed with “spam” and wants it to stop. As I scanned through the simulation campaigns sent 
over the year, it suddenly occurred to me why users struggle with whether or not to report an email. 
It’s because you’re sending the wrong types of simulations, coupled with punitive programs putting 
additional pressure on the user to just report the email. Simulate the threats making it to the inbox 
– NOT the topics already blocked by your spam filters, aka your Secure Email Gateway. I’m looking 
at you “eCard/Valentines” campaign fans. 

As you read this report, you’ll find it difficult to identify the simulation section as we’ve reported 
in years past. That was intentional. For years we’ve pushed our security awareness teams to align 
their programs to “real phish.” For the past few years, we’ve only added templates based on real 
phish we’ve observed. That too is intentional. But what you find are some highlights of what we 
observed over the year and how you can adjust your Security Awareness and Incident Response 
programs to better defend against the phishing threats making it to your users’ inboxes. It has been 
an exciting year talking to customers who have experienced the impact of the network effect.

 SECTION 1

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In 2022, cybersecurity threats increased exponentially and it’s no surprise 

the vast majority involved phishing. As threats increase in frequency, 
intensity, and sophistication, the need for rapid and actionable intelligence 
has never been greater. As a result of this increased frequency, Cofense 
Intelligence saw 569% more malicious phishing emails, had a 478% increase 
in the number of credential phishing related Active Threat Reports published 
and identified a 44% increase in malware. Based on this data, we conclude 
that credential phishing was the cyber threat of choice in 2022\.

SECTION 1Phishing is a major threat because it is so simple. Often, we hear of large, destructive attacks that sound extremely advanced, beyond 
the comprehension of security\-minded individuals. It is important to remember the initial access is often acquired well before the 
incident occurs and may come from simple phishing campaigns that have no apparent connection to any advanced persistent threat 
group. In the aftermath, as these sophisticated attacks make the news, organizations should not become so consumed with searching 
for specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) or malware that they ignore the emerging phishing threats. As threats increase in frequency 
and intensity, it is not only critical, but a fundamental necessity to protect and defend against daily emerging phishing attacks.

Over the past decade, we have built an unrivaled standard of phishing expertise. Our goal is to contribute the phishing expertise 
necessary to turn humans around the world into the strongest link in the security chain, and to translate the resulting human efforts 
into machine learning, phishing threat intelligence, and automated action(s). 

With our global network of 35\+ million human reporters, we crowdsource millions of suspicious enterprise emails that are processed, 
enriched, and analyzed by our unique intelligence insights. At times, even removing threats within seconds before users have the 
chance to interact with them.

Last year, we provided analysis on phishing threats with a 99\.996% accuracy rate. Through our global network effect, we can identify 
trends and tactics and provide an understanding of what the phishing landscape will look like as we move forward in 2023\. Our 
crowdsourced methodology provides an unparalleled aperture into the malicious emails that are reaching enterprise inboxes.

BASED ON OUR INTELLIGENCE, THE TOP FIVE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE EMAIL SECURITY LANDSCAPE ARE:

 Credential Phishing is the top attack vector with a 478% increase in malicious emails identified

 Emotet \& QakBot remain the top malware families to watch

 BEC continues to be one of the top cybercrimes for 8th year in a row

 Web3 technologies used in phishing campaigns increased 341%

 Telegram bots as exfiltration destinations increased 800%

The cybersecurity landscape is always evolving, so it is imperative to stay on top of the latest trends and tactics. 
To learn more about what our intelligence trends revealed, here’s a more in\-depth look at what we discovered last year.

SECTION 1TOP FIVE Top Attack Vector in 2022: Credential Phishing

It was no surprise to see credential phish still rank as the leading threats seen by our Phishing Defense Center (PDC) customers. 
As one of the several collection inputs to Cofense Intelligence, it’s also no surprise to see an increase of 478% of credential phishing\-
related Active Threat Reports published. This threat category still plays a significant role in the ransomware attack chain, as well as 
BEC. Wait, BEC? How does that connect? When a user falls susceptible to a credential phish, while the password may have been 
reset, the threat actor remains persistent in the inbox by adding auto\-forwarding rules for keywords related to financial transactions 
(i.e. invoice, purchase order, quote). These emails are then, in turn, used to target downstream organizations with BEC/Vendor 
Email Compromise threats.

TOP FIVE Emotet \& QakBot Remain the Top Malware Families to Watch

Throughout 2022, we analyzed and assessed top 
malware families seen in Figure 5\. However, in this 
report, we wanted to provide a quick reference 
guide for understanding the malware families 
that made up the highest volume of phishing 
campaigns disseminated in 2022\.

There are several characteristics that 
can make a malware family more 
appealing to threat actors, such as 
the malware features, cost, and 
complexity. In combination, 
these properties determine 
how well malware aligns to 
a threat actor’s agenda 
for a phishing campaign. 
Figure 5 shows the top 
5 malware families 
in 2022\.

The continued position of Emotet (and consequently malware loaders, which are often the first 
stage of a compromise) at the top of the list is a testament to its outscaling of all other malware\-
delivery campaigns. There was an overall increase in volume for keyloggers and Remote 
Access Trojans (RATs). Information stealers saw the largest increase with malware families like 
FormBook being high commodities in the phishing threat landscape. We continued to watch 
Snake Keylogger in 2022, which is a staple in the phishing threat landscape as it is a keylogger 
written in .NET. It can monitor a user’s keystrokes, scan applications to steal saved credentials, 
and exfiltrate this data through a variety of protocols. Although it is not as popular as other malware families such as FormBook or

Agent Tesla, it did maintain a significant presence throughout 2022, and 
its usage continues to increase. This banking trojan malware type passed 
RATs due to a high volume of QakBot phishing emails. Despite not having 
as high of volume as others in the Top 5, Qakbot remains at the top of our 
list of families to watch since it has been far more successful at bypassing 
SEGs and reaching inboxes.

SECTION 1 
 
 
 
TOP FIVE BEC Continues to be One of the Top Cybercrimes for the 
8th Year in a Row Related to Financial Losses

In 2022, Business Email Compromise (BEC) continued to be one of the leading cybercrimes related to financial losses for the 8th year 
in a row. With BEC responsible for billions in global losses with victims in 90% of the world, it’s no wonder scammers outside of Nigeria 
have started taking notice of the successes of BEC. While SEGs have evolved from spam filters to now being used to detect and potentially 
block malware, malicious links, and ransomware attacks, many fail at detecting conversational\-based phishing attacks such as this. 

Over the last year, BEC actors attacked with many different techniques, including requesting checks, wire transfers, payroll 
diversions, and gift cards. While many of these techniques are nothing new, we have observed a continued blending of tactics to 
make detection and mitigation even more difficult for organizations. By using and blending these attacks, threat actors continue to 
bypass SEGs to manipulate users into sending billions of dollars year after year. 

Successfully Bypassing Two\-Factor Authentication (2FA) to Gain Access to Accounts 

By putting the “compromise” in BEC, threat actors continued to use credential phishing attacks to gain access to organization inboxes 
to perform man\-in\-the\-mailbox (MiTMbox) attacks. Once an attacker gains access to an organization’s email account, they will 
routinely create email forward rules to monitor all traffic coming in and out of the account. In some cases, they will create rules that 
include the words “purchase order,” “invoice,” or other financially based transactions between clients. 

Once the threat actors identify an invoice or opportunity to re\-route the transaction, the threat actors pounce, replying to the known 
and trusted email thread with new information. In some cases, this will come from a look\-alike domain, and in other cases this 
will come from the compromised infrastructure itself. By modifying and forging invoices with new banking and account numbers, 
scammers are able to re\-route business transactions and invoices to accounts under their control. Unfortunately, many of these 
attacks are caught too late for a successful financial reversal. 

One of the best ways to mitigate against these attacks is to use two\-factor authentication (2FA), as the requirement for a second 
piece of information makes it virtually impossible to log into an account without the second piece of information. However, in 
2022, Microsoft published a technique used by scammers called adversary\-in\-the\-middle (AiTM) that successfully bypasses 2FA 
authentication. Through hijacking the session cookie, BEC attackers are able to gain access to the user’s account. 

Payroll Diversion Attacks Still Flying Under the Radar 

“Are you in the office? I need to update my direct deposit. Can I provide a voided check?” is still a technique used by BEC actors 
today. Dubbed payroll diversion scams, threat actors target Human Resources departments that have financial authority to change 
the financial records of employees. While attackers made a shift in mid 2014 to target enterprises and corporations, these attacks 
largely go unreported due to the same stigmas and lower losses as gift card scams. We continued to track wave after wave of 
payroll diversion attacks through our Cofense Reporter™ submissions from customers, meaning these attacks are still successfully 
bypassing email gateways.

Also noteworthy, we 
saw that nine different 
customers received 
an email from the 
same email address, 
which is clearly a 
spoofed domain.

Law Enforcement’s Takedown of Cybercrime

Although BEC, ransomware, and other cybercrime operations carried on through 2022, our research indicated that threat actors 
felt pressure from the arrests as law enforcement agencies worldwide made significant strides combating cyber threat actors. 
Authorities arrested individuals suspected of involvement in the LockBit ransomware and JabberZeus banking trojan operations. 
The FBI infiltrated the Hive ransomware group starting in July, ultimately leading to the takedown of the entire operation in January 
2023\. Authorities in several countries arrested dozens of suspected BEC perpetrators, as well. Ransomware attacks and payouts both 
trended downward compared to 2021\. If authorities continue to make high\-impact arrests, we expect to see more downward pressure 
on phishing threats, as actors will be forced to adapt, harden their operations against intelligence efforts and/or decentralize. 

SCAMMING THE SCAMMERS

To dig deeper into this conversational tactic, we spent some time interacting with real emails reported by users. In phases one 
and two of a multi\-part study into the criminal ecosystem of gift card attacks, we responded to BEC phishing attacks to gauge 
the level of interaction from the scammers. During this phase of the research, we wanted to see how many responses it took to 
identify the cash out method for BEC attacks. 

In phase one where we simply analyzed the delivery email, 6% of the analyzed emails presented themes of gift cards in the initial 
phish. In phase two, we responded to the scammers to try and identify the phishing theme. In 22% of these cases, we were able 
to identify gift card requests from the scammers. The significant jump signifies that for most gift card BEC attacks, scammers 
are looking for a response prior to asking for gift cards. 

Attackers Still Request Gift Cards in 2022 

In part three of our gift card study, we launched a successful counter\-operation against BEC actors to better understand the 
gift card ecosystem plaguing organizations and small businesses. Just like many types of BEC attacks, scammers pretend to 
be someone in the organization with authority, asking for a quick or urgent task to be done. Once the user confirms, they’re 
instructed to go to a retail store to purchase gift cards in different denominations. In some cases, attackers request the users’ 
phone numbers to move the conversation outside of an organization’s security structure and detection. 

But what happens when scammers ask for gift cards? And more importantly, what happens when they receive gift cards? We 
took $500 dollars of gift cards and gave them to the scammers. We wanted to see what the conversations looked like, how 
quickly they were cashed out, and what insights we could gather from the research. Here is what we learned. 

For the research, we used $25 worth of gift cards in each phish. While scammers typically asked for $500 or $1,000 dollars in 
gift cards, our researchers’ true intent was to get cards in larger denominations, such as $100\. It was surprisingly difficult to get 
the scammers to accept a $25 gift card as it broke their script and thought process for what was normally received, causing 
them to question the legitimacy of the funds soon to be stolen. Secondly, once the cards were sent the entire workflow was 
24 hours or less for the card to be stolen, sold, then re\-laundered into purchasing other goods online. We identified toy stores, 
greeting card stores, Amazon, and several other strange purchases once the cards were sold.

SECTION 1 
TOP FIVE Web3 Technologies Used in Phishing Campaigns 
Increased 341%

It’s important for threat actors to carefully craft links or carefully select hosts for links in order to bypass SEGs. The malicious use of 
Web3 technologies as a link\-crafting tool for phishing campaigns exploded in 2022\. “Web3” refers to a set of technologies intended 
to decentralize common internet and computing activity. Users of Web3 protocols host content collaboratively, which removes the

Web3 platforms to host malicious content throughout 2022, as evidenced by our strategic analysis, “Abuse of Web3 Technology 
for Evasive Phishing Grows Massively in 2022”. Overall, in 2022 there was a 341% increase in Web3 Technologies used in phishing 
campaigns. Most browsers still require a “gateway” server to interact with Web3\-hosted content, which gives organizations a chance 
to detect and block it. However, the technology will likely remain a useful weapon in threat actors’ arsenals for the foreseeable future.

TOP FIVE Telegram Bots as Exfiltration Destinations Increased 800%

Among phishing emails reaching inboxes over the course 
of 2022, the utilization of Telegram bots as exfiltration 
destinations for phished information increased gradually 
but significantly, resulting in a year\-over\-year increase of 
more than 800% between 2021 and 2022\. The increase 
is largely associated with the now popular tactic of using 
HTML attachments as delivery mechanisms in credential 
phishing. While Telegram bots being used by threat actors to 
exfiltrate information is not new, it has not been commonly 
known for its use in credential phishing. Telegram bots have 
become a popular choice for threat actors, since they are a 
low\-cost/free, single\-pane\-of\-glass solution. Threat actors 
appreciate the ease of setting up bots in a private or group 
chat, the bots’ compatibility with a wide range of programming 
languages, and ease of integrations into malicious mediums 
such as malware or credential phishing kits. Coupling the 
ease of Telegram bot setup and use with the popular and 
successful tactic of attaching an HTML credential phishing 
file to an email, a threat actor can quickly and efficiently reach 
inboxes while exfiltrating credentials to a single point, using 
an often\-trusted service.

PHISH SWIMMING IN MURKY WATERS 

Downstream Impacts, Ransomware

The FBI’s 2022 ICS report states that phishing email is the top crime for ransomware that targets 
organizations around the world. Ransomware is a primary downstream impact from email\-based 
threats. In one common scenario, other malware families are delivered initially to gain a foothold, then 
followed by installation of ransomware anywhere from hours to weeks later. In another scenario, a 
credential phishing email campaign gives the threat actor credentials they can use to access systems 
to deploy ransomware directly. In both cases, it is important to look upstream at the chain of events 
that led to the ransomware and determine the payloads delivered within the email. 

In 2021, there were well\-known instances of BazarBackdoor being used to deliver ransomware. 
However, in 2022 there was a combination of phishing threats and we cannot point to one 
single major malware used to deliver ransomware. Rather than focusing on the outcome such as 
ransomware, readers should focus on credential phishing, delivery mechanisms, and the malware 
type known as “loaders” which can be used to deliver ransomware. It is preferred to use tools to 
help prevent the delivery of malicious\-based emails. Operators of malware families like Emotet and 
Qakbot that offer the services of installing other malware on already\-compromised computers (called 
“malware\-installation as a service”) are prime options for ransomware operators to gain initial entry. 
These services become partner or “affiliates” in a ransomware operation. In November of 2022, 
Qakbot was identified as the primary malware foothold used by the Black Basta ransomware gang. 

While it is critical to monitor for ransomware at the endpoint, security teams may reduce the 
frequency and impact of endpoint events by focusing on credential phishing and an early\-stage 
malware from malicious email campaigns that can in turn be used to deliver ransomware. We 
analyze these threats at great lengths and provide unique human\-vetted expertise and analysis with 
actionable insights. We treat each malware infection as a potential vector for future ransomware 
attacks, reverse engineer the payloads and trace the steps that led to the infection to enable our 
customers to determine the flaws in their defenses and prevent phishing attacks. Using solutions 
such as Cofense Intelligence to help detect and prevent infections, while training employees to 
recognize and avoid interacting with malicious content can provide an intuitive line of protection that 
machines are not capable of. Phishing tactics are always evolving and becoming more complex. 

In 2022, threat 
actors used a 
combination 
of phishing 
threats and we 
cannot point 
to one single 
major malware 
used to deliver 
ransomware .

Big Breaches 

Data breaches in 2022 seemed to come fast and furious, impacting several high\-profile brands in the security sector including Cisco, 
Okta and LastPass. Large data breaches like this can be part of a cyclical pattern that involves phishing, since data breaches can 
begin with a phishing attack or contribute to future phishing activity. 

• 

• 

In May 2022, Cisco experienced a cyberattack where the attacker had to go to extreme lengths to hack into an employee’s 
personal Google account that contained passwords synced from their web browser. Besides the credential theft, there was an 
additional element of phishing called vishing (voice phishing) and multi\-factor authentication (MFA) fatigue where the threat actor 
prompt bombs the user with a flood of user authentications in hopes they will enable the attacker to gain unauthorized access. 
Once the threat actor has a foothold, they build their own backdoor accounts for access. 

In August 2022, the Okta event occurred where threat actors obtained credentials and unauthorized access to Workforce Identity 
Cloud (WIC) repositories hosted in GitHub and copied source code. Days after the Okta event, LastPass had an incident where 
credentials were obtained to extract information from a backup stored in a cloud\-based storage service. The adversary copied 
customer vault data which was stored in a “proprietary binary format” that contained unencrypted data, website URLs, usernames 
and passwords, secure notes, and form\-filled data. 

• 

In August 2022, LastPass’ incident opened the door to an even larger data breach in December which included user account 
information, billing, email addresses, telephone numbers and IP addresses. LastPass’ big data breach affected users across their 
product suite, eventually disclosing loss of source code.

2023 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report • 10

SECTION 2Threat actors use sensitive information 

such as contact lists, new credentials, and 

business processes to boost future phishing 

When large data breaches occur, it often results in the exposure 
of sensitive documents, personal information of employees or 
customers, and system, network, and application credentials. 
Compromised credentials may provide the threat actors 
responsible for the breach with temporary illicit access, but 
after the breach is discovered and/or publicized, it is much less 
likely that the credentials for those specific accounts will be 
useable. Instead, other sensitive and proprietary information 
(especially if published by the threat actors) can be employed 
in future phishing campaigns. Email addresses may be added 
to phishing target lists, and business process information 
may be used to craft targeted spear\-phishing emails. Threat 
actors can also use information obtained from data breaches to 
conduct future credential phishing attacks. Credential stuffing 
attacks use stolen credentials from one website or system to 
gain access to other websites/systems where the user has the 
same credentials. Threat actors then continue the train of impacts by once again using any discovered sensitive information such as 
contact lists, new credentials, and business processes to boost future phishing activity and attacks.

activity and attacks.

World Events 

Many major events happened across the globe over the course of 2022\. Threat actors use these events on the world stage to design 
phishing campaigns. The Russia\-Ukraine War captured the attention of many over the course of 2022\. Cofense Intelligence observed a 
variety of phishing campaigns using the Russia/Ukraine conflict. Threat actors are weaponizing the conflict for financial gain by creating 
well\-crafted credential phishing campaigns and donation scams. Threat actors using current 
events as themes within their email campaigns is quite common, and users should be universally 
vigilant against these threats. We have also seen a combination of lure tactics with a 
variety of emails using the Russia/Ukraine war as a lure reported to the Cofense Phishing 
Defense Center directly from enterprise users’ inboxes. Other major world events used in 
campaigns include the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the Beijing Winter Olympics. 

We observed that it is significantly more likely a tried\-and\-true phishing themes 
will be used rather than a stand\-alone current event theme (as actors use 
a combination of methods and tactics). There will always be attempts to 
convince the receiver their mailbox is full and their password needs to be 
updated. Attached invoices of all sorts will make it to people’s inboxes, 
along with shipping receipts, deposit receipts and voicemails. These sorts 
of lures were in the background throughout the year. Threat actors will 
be opportunistic with world events, but there is typically no reason to 
change from the more traditional (and dependable) lures, especially 
as those methods have proven to work. We continue to monitor 
phishing threats related to world events and will continue to 
identify malicious campaigns that are using the current events 
as a lure to target end users.

Blockchain, Cryptocurrency and NFT Phishing

Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are a popular topic for the general media, and consequently, a target for threat actors 
seeking financial gain. The blockchain is a public ledger used to store virtual currency secured by cryptography, or cryptocurrency. 
This type of digital currency differs greatly from legacy currency, such that banking controls for legacy currency make it difficult, if 
not impossible, for attackers to move currency out of an account. In contrast, a crypto wallet can be emptied almost immediately and 
the funds are unrecoverable. 

Throughout 2022, we observed crypto\-themed emails and phishing campaigns seeking to obtain digital wallets that contain tokens, 
but these are not the only malicious purposes for the digital assets. Due to the less\-than\-secure account controls, cryptocurrency is 
commonly used as payment methods for ransomware and sextortion campaigns, as well as within advance\-fee and romance scams. 
Certain malware families also seek to steal cryptocurrency wallet keys stored on infected machines, while others are designed to use 
an infected machine to mine cryptocurrencies.

We analyzed an uptick in crypto phishing emails, including one observation where threat actors used a convergence of crypto and the 
Russia/Ukraine war. The phishing email used the current Russia/Ukraine war as a lure to steal Bitcoin wallet data. We also detected 
another phishing threat spoofing OpenSea just days before they reported a successful attack that impacted seventeen users to steal 
over $1\.7 million worth of non\-fungible tokens (NFTs). This campaign used the excitement of a sweepstakes prize to lure victims to 
a spoofed OpenSea landing page. Threat actors used the domain “open\-sia\[.]io” to host the phishing page, which appears similar to 
the legitimate site. Once on the site, users were met with a spoofed OpenSea home page with the addition of a prize NFT at the top 
of the page. Users were requested to connect their wallet to claim the prize, even if it is already connected to their OpenSea account. 
Threat actors were seeking to gain access to a victim’s digital wallet by requesting they enter their private key, mnemonic phrase, or 
attach their keystore file. The email was strategically crafted by threat actors and was successful in reaching enterprise users. Again, 
threat actors use multiple phishing methods to lure victims to obtain credentials for theft. 

Crypto tokens are fungible, meaning they can be bought and traded several times much like a

company stock. NFTs are also stored on the blockchain but are non\-fungible, and they are often 
defined as ‘one\-of\-a\-kind’ tokens that can be depicted by anything digital such as a drawing or 
animation. Cryptocurrency and NFTs have both become a way to make purchases, exchange 
currency, and invest. Organizations and users often exchange cryptocurrency and NFTs 
through online platforms like OpenSea or Coinbase. Many crypto\- and NFT\-themed 

phishing emails we have seen can be classified as credential phishing and are often 
finance\-themed. Threat actors will spoof secure online platforms and even include 
links to domains they have registered that appear similar to legitimate sites. The 

overall goal of these campaigns is to gain access to a user’s digital crypto wallets 

or NFTs, which are often accomplished by compromising login credentials, 
private wallet keys, security phrases, and keystore files. As a comparison, 
using SWIFT to send a bank wire can have some success in recovering a 

wayward wire sent to the wrong account number. This is not the case for 
digital assets; once tokens are sent to a new wallet, the assets are not 

recoverable. This greatly increases the appeal of these attacks for the 

financially motivated threat actor.

SECTION 2Energy Sector (Critical Infrastructure) on High Alert

Energy companies and other critical infrastructure organizations were on high alert in 2022, following a series of high\-profile ransomware 
and phishing email\-based attacks observed in the previous year. Although they remained prime targets for high\-volume credential phishing 
campaigns throughout the year, fewer organizations were breached compared to 2021\. We tracked an advanced campaign in 2022 
that targeted the energy sector with the majority of its emails. The threat actors used chemical supply companies as themes or spoofed 
senders. We reported that 100% of the observed emails spoofing or themed around chemical supply targeted the energy sector. 

Malicious HTML Attachments

From 2021 to 2022 we observed an increase of over 300% in HTML files delivering malware. This was particularly driven by 
QakBot, which used HTML files that were either attached or downloaded via links embedded in the email in many of its campaigns. 
QakBot’s last campaign using Office macros was mid 2022, but QakBot threat actors began experimenting before that point with 
other delivery mechanisms, particularly HTML files, in early Q2 of 2022\. Overall usage of HTML files as a delivery mechanism 
started to ramp up in early March, which coincided with Microsoft’s announcement that macros would be disabled in its Office 
products. In addition to their increasing use in malware delivery, HTML files also continued to be used to deliver credential phishing 
throughout the year. In total, we observed a 295% increase in the use of malicious HTML files across both malware delivery and 
credential phishing throughout the year.

SECTION 2Adobe is the Top Domain Abused to Deliver Phishing Emails

In 2022, Cofense Intelligence reported that the abuse of hosting providers to deliver malicious files has become a popular method for 
threat actors to bypass security and deliver malware in credential phishing attacks as seen in Figure 10\. It is common to see trusted 
cloud providers like Amazon AWS, Google, SharePoint, and other well\-known organizations such as Adobe abused by threat actors. 
Lately, a wider variety of less\-common hosting providers have been seen. In some cases, fake providers have been created by threat 
actors such as Clickfunnels.com domains. Threat actors abuse legitimate services such as Dropbox, DocuSign, and other legitimate 
and trusted domain names in order to ensure malicious emails reach inboxes.

SECTION 2Top Malicious Attachment Types Reaching Inboxes

Cofense Intelligence identified file attachments such as .pdf, .html, and .htm, as the top 3 file extensions on email attachments that 
reached users in SEG\-protected environments as seen in Figure 12\. In Q4, for the first time in quite a while, .pdf no longer made up more 
than .htm and .html files combined, as overall HTML attachment usage rose to 44\.97% of the total. The file extensions of .pdf, .html, .htm, 
.shtml, and increasingly .xlsx are typically used for credential phishing. It is important to note that .pdf and .xlsx files will contain links 
to credential phishing pages, while .html, .htm, and .shtml will either present a credential phishing page when opened or automatically 
redirect to one. Next, the file extensions in the top 10 (.docx and .xlsx) were most often used to deliver malware via a known vulnerability 
and bug called Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability (CVE\-2017\-11882\) that allows the attacker to perform arbitrary code\-
execution. Also, .docx and .xlsx have been seen in malicious Office macros as this approach is easy to execute and has extremely low 
barriers to entry which remains a method to watch in 2023\. We have identified that .docx and .xlsx have been seen delivering small 
volumes of credential phishing via embedded URLs. The archive compressed file name in the top 10 (.zip) was used to deliver such a 
wide variety of malware and phishing that it is impossible to narrow it down to a single most commonly delivered threat.

Emotet Phishing Emails Exploit 2022 Tax Season, Spoofing IRS

During the 2022 tax season, Emotet consistently employed financial themes in its phishing campaigns and has exploited the arrival of the 
United States tax season to construct emails targeting end users who need to file tax returns. In March 2022, Cofense Intelligence observed 
phishing emails using W\-9 tax form lures to deliver Emotet payloads. In past years, we reported on Emotet taking advantage of tax season 
to deliver W\-9 themed malicious documents; in 2022, the tactic was further improved. Emotet operators started to include the United States 
IRS logo, a specific mention of the organization employing individual recipients, and a password to access the attached password\-protected 
archives. When the Office macro\-laden spreadsheets enclosed in the password\-protected archives were opened, a request to enable 
macros is presented to the user, and if they accept/allow macros to be enabled, Emotet .dll files are delivered to the victim’s computer.

2023 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report • 15

SECTION 2Return of Emotet Phishing Emails 

In the beginning of Q3, we saw large volumes of Emotet emails, until around mid\-July when the campaign activity ceased. Later in 
October and November, we saw a sudden increase in Emotet C2 traffic. Emotet began sending malicious emails after three months of 
relative inactivity. It is suspected that Emotet authors were using their downtime to make significant changes intended to improve the 
effectiveness of their malware delivery campaigns. In the past, Emotet authors have been known to make significant changes to the 
malware’s delivery methods before coming back from extended hiatus.

Malware Foothold: QakBot

Cofense Intelligence identified QakBot as one of the malware families to watch in 2022\. Throughout the year, it was the top malware 
family seen in phishing emails reported to the Cofense Phishing Defense Center (PDC) from inboxes. The success rate of the 
phishing emails reaching enterprise inboxes can be attributed to the use of hijacked email threads and embedded URLs, among other 
tactics, techniques, and procedures that are known to aid in bypassing security. In Q3 of 2022, threat actors using the new version 
5 of QakBot made several changes to their phishing tactics. The most notable new tactic employs attaching malicious HTML files 
to deliver the payload. This new tactic does not utilize an embedded payload or redirect URL, as typical of most malicious emails 
delivering via HTML file attachments. Instead, the malicious payload is hardcoded into the HTML file, dropping when the HTML is 
executed inside the browser. This makes the delivery mechanism versatile and stealthy. The HTML file drops the payload locally 
without having to reach out to an external resource. QakBot continues to evolve defensive mechanisms against malware analysis, 
and phishing emails delivering QakBot continue to successfully reach inboxes. This makes QakBot the malware family to continue to 
watch, especially since a successful QakBot infection can lead to more costly threats like ransomware.

The QakBot banking trojan, also known as QBot or Pinkslipbot, was first released in 2007 and has become a prominent threat that 
is effective at reaching users’ inboxes. Throughout 2022, we saw QakBot campaigns go to extensive lengths to bypass security 
measures, avoid detection, and obstruct analysis tactics. The most notable changes were to the delivery of the malware, but we 
also saw the malware itself receive updates particularly to the command\-and\-control servers when QakBot updated to version 5 
in September.

Near the beginning of 2022, Microsoft announced they will be changing the default Office settings to block Visual Basic for

As such, we saw major malware families such as QakBot seek new delivery mechanisms. More particularly, QakBot’s delivery 
methods changed drastically for the first time since June 2020\. QakBot operators tried several new delivery mechanisms to deliver 
and install their malware; Microsoft Windows Installer (MSI files), LNK shortcut files, the Follina exploit (CVE\-2022\-30190\) and 
HTML smuggling.

SECTION 2Noteworthy Mentions

Phishing Attacks Supported by Illicit Marketplaces – “Phishing as a Service (PaaS)”

For years, illicit online marketplaces have been a critical part of the phishing threat landscape, allowing threat actors to buy and sell 
access to compromised accounts and servers to phishing activity. This reality continued throughout 2022, as phishing threat actors 
presented a consistent demand for compromised email accounts and websites. As an illustration, we conducted a focused study of 
several publicly available online shops running a platform named Ofux, which offers everything a phishing threat actor might need: 
email sending capability, access to websites for hosting malicious content, and access to hacked individual email accounts. Threat 
actors who compromise accounts and websites may choose not to expand their efforts into phishing or spam operations, but these 
marketplaces still give them a chance to monetize their work. Meanwhile, buyers can take advantage of access to reputable assets 
at low prices. Further, the “Phishing as a Service” business model provides phishing kits and cybercriminals as a managed service for 
threats in today’s marketplace. Phishing campaigns that use such legitimate but compromised assets are more likely to reach targeted 
users, highlighting the need for robust email defenses, and even stronger employee/user education.

Conti Leaks Demonstrated Importance of Phishing in Ransomware Operations

Cofense Intelligence provided analysis on the Conti Ransomware Gang Leaks in 2022, which became a valuable resource for security 
researchers. The leaks could also be used by threat actors with a desire to emulate Conti activity. Seeing the strategies, tactics, 
resources, profits, and daily discussions of a premier ransomware group could demystify their activities and convince others that a 
similar operation is feasible. 

The Conti leaks bore several important lessons for those defending against both ransomware and phishing. For us, the combined 
takeaway of these lessons is that phishing was central to Conti’s success. At the time of the leaks, they were continuing to invest 
massive resources into it as a pillar of their lucrative ransomware operation. 

• Conti paid operators of malware such as Emotet and Trickbot to conduct phishing campaigns and establish footholds in target 

organizations before distributing those footholds to a team of hackers who specialize in expanding access.

• Some of Conti’s specialists were involved in crafting semi\-random phishing templates to increase victim click rates.
• Conti members and affiliates were thoroughly attentive to email security measures and tested to make sure their emails reach 

inboxes on popular platforms.

• Conti’s phishing and intrusion operators are taught to pay attention to cybersecurity research on their own activity.

This could potentially motivate new ransomware operators to enter the landscape, improve the operations of existing low\-level 
ransomware operators, and/or entice recruits to join phishing operations that support ransomware. The leaks may also cause existing 
threat actors to become more concerned with the security of their operations.

Whaling in Bulk 

Targeted phishing efforts against executives and other high\-profile individuals are often referred to as “whaling” within the security 
industry. While “whaling” emails can be extremely customized for a single individual, they can also be conducted in bulk with a 
considerable failure rate, but with minimal effort in hopes that one email will be successful. 

As a prime example, we reported on a credential phishing campaign that spoofed DocuSign and bypassed SEGs in 2022\. Through 
initial collaboration with Cofense Intelligence customers and subsequently with the Cofense Phishing Defense Center (PDC), we 
determined that it was a whaling campaign to exclusively target executive\-level employees, primarily CFOs. Emails from the campaign 
were sent to executives with the CFO title, but were also seen targeting CEOs, directors, and board members. The campaign targeted 
individuals in the insurance, real estate, manufacturing, professional services, and mining sectors. The emails spoofed DocuSign and 
claimed to deliver documents related to settlement agreements and other financial documents.

SO NOW WHAT?

How to Enhance your Email Security 

With the increase in ransomware, nation state attacks, and major incidents in general, pressure 
continues to drive visibility of an organization’s Information Security program by boards, corporate 
executives, and cyber insurers. With this pressure, organizations continue to evaluate ways to 
mitigate risk and assess what controls need to be added or enhanced. By adding controls to their 
email security program, organizations can raise their overall security posture.

We observed that customers with a full End\-to\-End Email Security solution, as seen in Figure 17, have 
a resilience rate double that of customers with simulation\-only programs. We continue to encourage 
organizations to align their simulation program to threats making it past their SEG and landing in 
inboxes. With credential phish continuing to lead the way for real phishing threats, organizations 
continue to experience an increased appetite for use of real\-life simulations. Last year, we reported 
only 29% of scenarios used a credential threat, while this year this category increased to 34% of 
scenarios. We also observed a slight increase in attachment scenarios. This too aligns with the 
threats we observed as threat actors continue to leverage .html/.htm files that are difficult to block.

Still need more recommendations to enhance your program and strengthen your reporting 
culture? Let’s review the use case detailed in Figure 20 below. This organization in Figure 20 
started running its simulation program in 2019 but wanted step up the reporting culture. The 
program operator engaged our Professional Services team to identify real phish that were already 
being reported by users to use for their simulation campaigns. The team launched a 5\-day phishing 
simulation bootcamp to bolster reporting among users that were not actively using the Reporter 
button. Over the year, the team also adopted a new hire simulation program and addressed repeat 
clickers. As you can see from the results in Figure 20, not only did they reduce their susceptibility 
rate, but their reporting rate had a double\-digit increase. What you can’t see from these numbers 
is the effect this had on reducing the amount of non\-malicious emails being reported, such as 
spam and business communications. Why is this a big deal? Ask your SOC!

SECTION 3Checklist: Protect Your Organization from Top Threats

BEC/Vendor Email Compromise

This threat type is very difficult to simulate. Even when you make efforts to simulate something similar to what your 
organization might experience, you run the risk of overburdening your executive team that may need to respond to users 
trying to verify if they sent the email.

 Ask your CEO and other senior executives to talk about this threat in company all\-hands meetings and inform the 
company they will never ask for “special favors” or gift card purchases.

 Send newsletters with real examples of phishing messages reported by users. Peer recognition can go a long way!

 Collaborate with your finance team to review and update processes related to vendor master changes related to the 
banking information.

 Many SEGs allow configuration settings that will allow increased protections by blocking executive spoofing or allowing 
free email account domains. Do you need to allow @gmail.com accounts to send external email? 

 REPORT! Report any losses to law enforcement. No matter the size of the loss, it’s critical to report these incidents. The 
US Secret Service established a Global Incident Operations Center (GIOC), specific to BEC, to bring charges against these 
threat groups. It’s been reported that a small $4,000 loss was able to be matched against a larger crime. Time is of the 
essence. If the loss is reported within 24 hours, the likelihood of reclaiming even a portion of the loss increases.

Credential Phishing

 Disable auto\-forwarding rules across the organization. Unable to fully block? Review rules to work with the business to 
allow exceptions for legitimate business needs. Resetting a users’ credentials due to a recent campaign? Check the auto\-
forward rules and remove rogue rules potentially set up by threat actor.

 Continue to increase the cadence of simulation scenarios using this threat type. It’s not always easy to coordinate these 
campaigns but think of it as a tabletop exercise!

 Customize your Microsoft landing page with your company logo. Communicate to the organization to report any landing 
pages that don’t fit the corporate branding standards.

 Enable MFA. Enhance the authentication experience to help users avoid MFA exhaustion. Microsoft recently provided 
additional enhancements for this very reason – number matching and location of request.

Attachments

 Threat actors continuously tune their tactics to land in the inbox and the same holds true with file attachments. As 
technology controls implement new configurations to block file types used by threat actors, they pivot to something new.

 Block malicious file types. This list continues to expand as threat actors leverage new file types to land in the inbox. Does 
your organization need to accept .html /.htm files externally? Who sends OneNote files externally?

 PDFs. This used to be the “safe” file type. No longer. Not only do threat actors embed links to login pages to steal 
credentials, we now observe PDFs delivering malware via a chain of links embedded within the PDF document.

Malware

 Remove local admin rights. Without the ability to run code locally, this will reduce the risk of malware executing if the user 
interacts with a malicious file or website.

SECTION 3CONCLUSION

As the threat landscape continues to evolve and threat actors continue to find more 

sophisticated ways to bypass standard email security solutions, your organization needs the 
resources that can enable them to identify, protect, detect and respond to all email security 
threats. And that’s exactly our mission. 

Cofense was built on the foundation that humans are critically important to your security program. Threat actors are constantly 
targeting people’s hopes, fears, emotions, struggles and sympathies, to trick them into divulging their credentials. If your employees 
aren’t trained properly, divulging these credentials opens your company to ransomware, malware and many other potential threats. 

That’s why it all starts with providing them with REAL simulations that replicate the REAL threats hitting their inboxes and putting 
tools in their fingertips to report those quickly and easily. 

Cofense email security expertise is built on 
human experience with millions of suspicious 
and malicious emails. These emails are 
crowdsourced from professionals all around 
the world, processed, enriched, and analyzed 
to provide a unique view of what the phishing 
landscape looks like as we move forward into 
2023\. This crowdsourced methodology provides 
Cofense an unparalleled aperture into the 
malicious emails reaching enterprise inboxes, 
providing customers the opportunity to react.

Once these malicious or suspicious emails are reported, we 
analyze these threats at great length and provide intelligent, 
human\-vetted expertise and analysis with actionable insights. 
We treat each malware infection as a potential vector for 
future ransomware attacks, reverse engineer the payloads 
and trace the steps that led to the infection to enable our 
customers to determine the flaws in their defenses and prevent 
phishing attacks. 

That intelligence, combined with our global network of more than 
35\+ million human reporters, enables us to have unique insights 
into email threats targeting your organization. Sometimes even 
detecting and removing advanced attacks BEFORE they reach 
your inbox. 

How, you ask? 

With our real\-time, crowdsourced intelligence. If a malicious 
email is reported by a user in our global network, it can then be 
automatically quarantined from other inboxes, highlighting the 
power of the network effect. 

Cofense email security expertise is built on human experience 
with millions of suspicious and malicious emails. These emails 
are crowdsourced from professionals all around the world, 
processed, enriched, and analyzed to provide a unique view 
of what the phishing landscape looks like as we move forward 
into 2023\. This crowdsourced methodology provides Cofense 
an unparalleled aperture into the malicious emails reaching 
enterprise inboxes, providing customers the opportunity to react. 

We know that phishing tactics are always evolving and becoming more complex. So, our Cofense Intelligence provides a human\-
vetted layer to pinpoint the actual phishing emails out of the noise of suspicious\-looking spam, rank those threats, and provide the 
automation to remove those phishing emails within seconds or minutes of reaching the inbox. 

Looking at 2023 and beyond, we know email will continue to be one of the top attack vectors for cyber threats, and we are committed 
to providing best\-in\-class email security to keep our customers secure. With the only end\-to\-end email security solution powered
