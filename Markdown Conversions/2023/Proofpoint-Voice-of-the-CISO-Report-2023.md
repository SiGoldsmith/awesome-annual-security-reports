## Introduction
PROOFPOINT 2023 VOICE OF THE CISO REPORT
A Reality Check for CISOs
It’s no overstatement to say that the past year was a busy one in the world  
of cybersecurity. 
Ransomware continued to wreak havoc across the globe. New and increasingly 
devastating attacks upended organizations of every size, across every industry 
and in every jurisdiction. For example, a single ransomware attack contributed to 
the permanent closure of Lincoln College, a 157-year-old educational bastion in 
rural Illinois.[^1] On the other end of the spectrum, a series of attacks paralyzed the 
government of Costa Rica, forcing officials there to declare a national emergency.[^2] 
The supply chain also found itself firmly in the sights of cyber criminals. Attackers 
doubled down on compromising third party, cloud and privileged identities to infiltrate 
networks and exfiltrate data.[^3]  
Meanwhile, critical infrastructure hung in the balance amid a backdrop of unrelenting attacks and geopolitical unease. Russian 
attackers targeted U.S. airports,[^4] and Chinese-aligned threat actors exploited telecoms’ vulnerabilities.[^5]  
The prior year, with most pandemic disruption overcome, CISOs for a brief time appeared to feel a sense of calm, composure and 
confidence in their security posture. Astoundingly, that feeling has already vanished, replaced by elevated concern.
As we look to 2023 and beyond, we can expect a return to a harsher reality. Ransomware looks set to wreak more disruption as 
data extortion becomes the rule rather than the exception. At the same time, increasing commercialization of dark-web exploit tools, 
initial-access brokers and “as-a-service” attack infrastructures threaten to make cyber crime even more open to anyone with a few 
dollars and ill intent.
Amid growing concerns around cyber risk and organizational preparedness, navigating this threat landscape remains a matter of 
protecting people and defending data. Modern CISOs know that users are at the center of cybersecurity. And they understand how 
critical it is to safeguard their organization’s sensitive information, especially in light of an uncertain economy and employee churn.
To gain deeper insight into the mind of the CISO during this pivotal time, Proofpoint surveyed 1,600 of them from around the world. 
They graciously shared their experiences over the last year and their outlook for the years ahead.
In this summary of our findings, we explore how the global recession is applying pressure to security budgets and how CISOs 
must remain steadfast in pressing the C-suite for critical controls to protect their organizations. We also learn how boards are 
increasingly becoming part of the cybersecurity conversation and the impact this is having on their understanding of security issues 
and their relationships with CISOs. Finally, we unpack the issue of burnout among CISOs as many struggle with the pressures of 
personal liability and excessive expectations.
Once again, this report would not have been possible without the insight offered by cybersecurity and information security 
professionals across the globe. We offer our sincere thanks for your time and your feedback.

## Chapter 1: Back to "Business as Usual"
 
Last year’s report uncovered a palpable feeling among CISOs that there 
was a period of calm after a once-in-a-generation crisis. With the pandemic 
disruption finally subsiding and hybrid work setups a mainstay for most, 
CISOs felt comfortable that the worst was behind them. At the time, just 48% 
believed that a cyber attack was on the horizon within the coming year. 
That’s changing. In this year’s survey, over two-thirds (68%) of CISOs 
said they feel at risk of a material cyber attack in the next 12 months. 
This pronounced shift suggests that security professionals see the threat 
landscape heating up once again, and have recalibrated their level of  
concern to match.
![Percentage of CISOs who agree that their organization is at risk of a material cyber attack in the next 12 months: UK 84%, Germany 83%, Singapore 80%, South Korea 75%, UAE 75%, France 74%, U.S. 73%, Spain 72%, Brazil 69%, Japan 65%, Canada 58%, Netherlands 58%, Sweden 58%, KSA 55%, Australia 53%, Italy 49%. Global Average: 2023 = 68%, 2022 = 48%, 2021 = 64%]
CISOs in the UK (84%), 
Germany (83%) and 
Singapore (80%) are 
most concerned about 
experiencing a material 
cyber attack.
Italy’s CISOs are the most 
optimistic, with just 49% 
fearing an attack.

next 12 months, with 25% 
rating the risk as very likely.
68%

### Awareness vs Preparedness
Increased awareness among CISOs of the danger of a potential cyber attack can be 
viewed as a positive. But we found a concerning disconnect between the perceived 
likelihood of such an event and how prepared organizations are to deal with one.
Nearly two-thirds (61%) agree that their organization is unprepared to cope with a 
targeted cyber attack. Once again, this is above 2022’s figure of 50% and more in line 
with 2021’s finding of 66%. This is further evidence that CISOs are returning to the 
“new normal”—though it’s a normal that offers little comfort.
For their part, board members are much 
more confident in their organization’s 
ability to deter cyber threats. In our survey 
of board members last year, just 47% 
believed they were unprepared for such 
an eventuality.[^6] But with CISOs having 
a better read of security posture and 
understanding of the threat landscape, this 
board-level optimism is likely based on an 
incomplete picture of the current situation.

### A CISO’s eye view of the threat landscape
When it comes to the kinds of threats occupying the minds of the world’s CISOs, four major categories lead the way:
- Email fraud (33%) 
- Insider threats (30%) 
- Cloud account compromise (29%)  
- DDoS attacks (29%)
This list is almost unchanged from the previous year (though email fraud and insider threats swapped places in the top two 
spots.) CISOs are right to remain concerned about these threats. Their continued prominence as a top priority reflects the 
challenge they continue to pose.
On a more positive note, CISO concerns seem to be filtering through to the rest of the C-suite; board members agree that email 
fraud poses the most pressing threat.
![What, if anything, do you perceive to be the biggest cybersecurity threats within your organization/industry in the next 12 months? (Pick up to three.): Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack 29%, Smishing/Vishing 27%, Malware 26%, Email fraud (business email compromise) 33%, Ransomware attacks 27%, Supply chain attacks 27%, Insider threat (negligent, accidental or criminal) 30%, Cloud account compromise (Microsoft 365 or G Suite or other) 29%]
[^6]: Board member statistics from “Cybersecurity: The 2022 Board Perspective Report.”
Email fraud is the top concern 
among CISOs in Japan (45%), 
UAE (45%), France (35%) the UK 
(34%) and Germany (31%).
Insider threats lead the way in Spain 
(38%), Singapore (35%) and Canada 
(32%).
Among industries, business and 
professional (39%), public sector 
(38%), retail (35%) and IT, technology 
and telecoms (33%) all agree that 
email fraud will be the biggest threat 
over the next 12 months.
> Organizations are finally back to ‘business as usual’ following years of coping with the 
pandemic and its aftermath. CISOs fully understand how critical their supply chains are 
and the significant impact of cyber-attacks and ransomware on those supply chains. 
There is a need for a continuous and constantly evolving partnership between companies 
and their suppliers on the topic of cybersecurity that results in stronger requirements and 
cyber controls. Working collaboratively across sectors to raise the level of security yields 
benefits for all and creates greater deterrence for the adversaries.

## Chapter 2: Protecting People—The Cybersecurity Cornerstone
 
Just as CISOs remain largely unchanged in their view of the threat landscape, they also hold their organization’s employees 
in a similar light to previous years. 
Almost two-thirds (60%) consider human error to be their organization’s biggest 
cyber vulnerability. This is consistent with our findings in 2022 and 2021. In those 
studies, 56% and 58%, respectively, agreed with the statement.
An even higher percentage of board directors (67%) shared this view. The finding 
suggests that the C-suite now, if belatedly, recognizes the threat that CISOs have 
witnessed firsthand. This newfound awareness can only be good news.
Still, CISOs have expressed similar concerns about human vulnerability for several 
years now. Clearly, improving confidence in workers’ cybersecurity savviness 
remains a challenge.
Even more CISOs (63%) agree that human risk more broadly—including malicious and negligent employees—is a key 
cybersecurity concern in the next two years. This is most keenly felt in the UK, where 78% of CISOs agree, followed by:
- Japan (75%) 
- Brazil (72%) 
- Singapore (72%) 
- U.S. (68%) 
- Spain (68%)
![Percentage of CISOs in agreement that human error is their organization’s biggest cyber vulnerability: UK 78%, France 75%, Brazil 73%, Japan 70%, U.S. 69%, Sweden 67%, Canada 66%, Spain 65%, Singapore 59%, UAE 59%, Netherlands 56%, Australia 51%, KSA 48%, Italy 48%, Germany 45%, South Korea 34%. Global Average: 2023 = 60%, 2022 = 56%, 2021 = 58%]
of CISOs consider 
human error to be their 
organization’s biggest 
cyber vulnerability.
60%

### The people problem
It is hardly surprising that people risk remains such a prominent concern among CISOs when just 61% believe that employees 
understand their role in protecting their employer. This leaves 2 in 5 CISOs ill at ease about whether their users are equipped to 
detect and deter cyber threats. 
Once again, this number is consistent with previous findings (60% in 2022 and 
58% in 2021). The trend suggests little progress in building a culture of security 
awareness.
Countries with the highest percentage of CISOs who agree that “employees 
understand their role in protecting their organization against cyber threats,” include:
- France (79%) 
- Japan (75%) 
- UK (75%) 
- Spain (73%)
In our earlier survey, board members reported a greater level of confidence. More 
than 75% agreed that employees understand their role—a concerning disconnect 
about the perceived security posture of their people. 
This is likely because board directors can be sheltered from employees’ day-to-day actions, in many cases interacting only with 
higher-ranking, well-informed and top-performing workers. By contrast, the CISO rightly has a closer ear to the ground—and a 
more realistic grasp of cybersecurity awareness and abilities throughout the organization.
CISOs in France (79%) have the 
most confidence that employees 
understand their role in protecting 
their organizations.
The belief that people are the biggest 
security vulnerability decreases as 
company size increases: 61% in those 
with 200-499 employees and 47% in 
those with 5,000+.
CISOs in retail (76%), transport 
(67%), IT, technology and telecoms 
(67%) and finance (67%) are most 
concerned about people risk over the 
next two years. 
of CISOs believe 
that their employees 
understand their role 
in protecting their 
organization against 
cyber threats, with 25% 
strongly agreeing.
61%
> Research consistently finds that human error is one of the key contributors to successful 
cyber attacks. As long as this vulnerability remains, CISOs will struggle to protect their 
data and systems. Although human error is inevitable, having guardrails, as well as strong 
policies and procedures in place, can go a long way in mitigating this risk and hardening 
your people perimeter.

## Chapter 3: Defending Data 
 
Protect people, defend data: these are the keys tenets of any effective 
cybersecurity strategy. But unfortunately, organizations appear to 
struggle with both. 
Almost two-thirds—63%—of global CISOs say they have had to deal 
with the loss of sensitive information in the past year. Bearing the brunt 
of data loss incidents are organizations in energy (71%), business and 
professional services (68%) and retail (68%).
![Percentage of CISOs whose organizations have dealt with a material loss of sensitive information in the past 12 months: Sweden 87%, Germany 85%, U.S. 76%, Japan 75%, UK 74%, France 74%, Australia 69%, KSA 65%, Spain 58%, Brazil 58%, Singapore 55%, Italy 54%, Canada 49%, UAE 47%, South Korea 42%, Netherlands 41%. 2023 Global Average = 63%]
For most, data loss came about as a result of an operating system (OS) vulnerability on endpoint, server or device (36%),  
an external attack (35%), system misconfiguration (35%) or negligent insider (34%).
![What was the cause of the data loss event? (Pick all that apply.): OS vulnerability on endpoint/server/device/other 36%, External attack (cybercriminal) 35%, System misconfiguration 35%, Negligent insider/employee carelessness (An employee that unknowingly misuses data) 34%, Malicious or criminal insider (An employee that misuses data for the purpose of harming the organization intentionally) 33%, Credential theft 31%, Lost/stolen devices 28%]
of global CISOs say their organization 
has dealt with a material loss of sensitive 
information in the past 12 months.
63%

And the consequences of data loss are as far reaching as the causes. Most CISOs report post-attack recovery costs such 
operational downtime and data recovery (38%), financial loss (33%) and regulatory sanctions (33%).
![What was the end result of the event on your organization? (Pick all that apply.): Post-attack recovery costs (operational downtime, data recovery, legal, etc.) 38%, Financial loss 33%, Regulatory sanctions (fines or market loss/sanctions) 33%, Loss of critical data 31%, Credential theft 31%, Loss of customers 31%, Reputational damage 31%]
Spotlight on malicious insiders
Although insider negligence edged out malicious and compromised users as the leading 
cause of data loss events last year, CISOs expect a reversal in the year ahead. Malicious 
(43%) and compromised (40%) insiders are deemed more likely to cause a data breach 
or exposure in the next 12 months. The finding suggests that CISOs increasingly believe 
that more employees are exposing data on purpose. The continuing impact of the Great 
Resignation—and more recently, mass layoffs—undoubtedly loom large in this assertion. 
Many industries saw a significant increase in post-pandemic staff turnover. Some 82% 
of CISOs report that employees leaving their organization has contributed to a data 
loss event. The two sectors affected the most were retail (90%) and IT, technology and 
telecoms (88%).
These trends leave security teams with a near-impossible challenge. When people leave, 
stopping them from taking data is difficult.
Some organizations require written guarantees from former employees that they will delete 
all company data. Others threaten the new employer of potential liability if the employee 
shares any data from the old job. But neither is close to being a satisfactory solution.
of CISOs agree that 
employees leaving 
their organization 
played a role in a 
data loss event.
82%
> Organizations typically deploy a variety of security solutions and mitigating controls to protect 
against the loss of sensitive data, but they often overlook one factor—employees who leave for 
greener pastures often take the data with them. CISOs can’t solve this problem with technical 
controls alone, and this is where a strong security culture comes in. Educating employees, setting 
the expectations, garnering senior business leadership support—and then adding procedures and 
controls around it—can mitigate and eliminate some of the most common data leak problems.

### Dealing with data loss
Against a backdrop of constant data loss across industries and countries, 60% of CISOs still contend that they have adequate 
data protections in place.
Board members are even more confident, with 75% believing this to be the case. 
However, this may due to CISOs sharing with them a well-presented picture of 
events rather than the unfiltered reality.
Despite confidence in their current abilities, information protection and data 
governance remain a top priority going forward for 61% of the world’s CISOs. That’s 
a slight increase from 59% last year. 
Once again, board members feel more strongly, with 75% in agreement. Again, this 
is likely because of their limited view—board members focus on top-line concerns 
rather than the numerous security issues CISOs deal with throughout the year. 
When it comes to the tools and protocols making up cyber defense, most CISOs report a broad and varied arsenal.
![What protocols do you have in place to combat organizational data loss?: We educate employees on data security best practices 39%, We have a cloud security solution in place (example: CASB) 36%, We have isolation technology which avoids employees entering credentials on web forms 36%, We have a data loss prevention (DLP) agent in place 35%, We have email security technology in place 35%, We have endpoint security technology in place 35%]
87% of organizations in 
Sweden dealt with material 
data loss in the last year—
the highest rate of any 
country surveyed. 
Insider negligence is the 
leading cause of data 
loss in Brazil (54%), Japan 
(48%) and Singapore (40%).
Loss of critical data (36%) 
and reputational damage 
(36%) are the biggest 
consequences of data loss 
for large organizations 
(5,000+ employees). 
Smaller organizations (200-
499 employees) are most 
impacted by post-attack 
recovery costs (46%).
With people a major contributor to data loss, it is heartening to see that user education leads the way as a defense. But as 
effective as awareness training can be, it does little to combat malicious or compromised insiders.
of CISOs agree 
that the data within 
their organization is 
adequately protected.
60%

## Chapter 4: Building a Defense to Fight on Every Front
 
Today’s CISOs face a fight on multiple fronts. They must combat external threats such as ransomware and supply chain risk to 
malicious, negligent and compromised insiders. For the most part, CISOs feel they have adequate resources to wage such a 
war. But many remain woefully overexposed. 
As supply chains grow larger and more complex, protecting these increasingly opaque networks is more difficult than ever. 
In spite of this, most CISOs say they have the issue under control. Some 64% believe they have appropriate controls in place 
to mitigate supply chain risk. This represents a modest increase from 2022 (59%), demonstrating that the issue remains a  
top priority.
![Percentage of CISOs who agree their organization has appropriate controls in place to mitigate supply chain risk: UK 79%, Japan 78%, France 77%, Sweden 75%, Brazil 71%, Singapore 69%, Canada 67%, U.S. 65%, Australia 65%, Spain 59%, Netherlands 58%, UAE 56%, South Korea 53%, Italy 51%, Germany 50%, KSA 48%. 2023 Global Average = 64%]
When it comes to more direct attacks on their organization, CISOs are increasingly prepared to rely on insurers to limit the 
damage. Almost two-thirds (61%) said they would place a claim on cyber insurance policies to recover losses incurred. Retail 
(75%) and IT, technology and telecoms (65%) are most likely to mitigate financial losses in this way. 
The World Economic Forum reports that 71% of organizations have cyber insurance in place,[^7] so this finding is no surprise.  
But relying on such policies alone is growing more complicated. 
For one, a recent increase in claims has led many insurers to raise premiums; some are withdrawing coverage for common 
threats like ransomware altogether.[^8] What’s more, while insurance can offer some financial compensation in the event of a data 
breach, it does little to rebuild customer trust or company reputation. 
This, along with an increase in more sophisticated and devasting ransomware attacks, may be why CISOs are increasingly 
open to paying ransoms to cyber criminals. 
Just 14% disagree that their organization is likely to pay a ransom to restore systems or prevent the release of data in the next 
12 months; 62% say the opposite.

![Percentage of CISOs by industry who agree that if impacted by ransomware within the next 12 months, their organization is likely to pay a ransom to restore systems/prevent the release of data: Retail 73%, Public sector 68%, IT, technology and telecoms 65%, Financial services 65%, Manufacturing and production 63%, Energy, oil/gas and utilities 60%, Media, leisure and entertainment 58%, Education 52%, Healthcare 52%, Business and professional services 52%, Transport 44%]
Most CISOs (62%) are confident that their organization can detect and remove a threat actor using stolen or compromised 
credentials before any material damage occurs. Just 14% disagree.  
This confidence is likely misplaced. While most organizations may have adequate endpoint detection and response technology, 
such tools will not alert on compromised credentials.

### Spotlight on budgets and priorities
With a look to the future, CISOs’ priorities for the next two years are largely unchanged from last year’s report. The desire to 
innovate (39%), consolidate (37%) and outsource (35%) aspects of cybersecurity remain strong. The numbers underline a 
commitment to these transformational long-term projects.
![What are the top priorities for your organization’s IT security department over the next two years? (Pick up to three.): Improving information protection and data classification 39%, Enabling business innovation (example: DevSecOps, product development) 37%, Consolidation and/or simplification of security solutions and controls 35%, Outsourcing security controls 34%, Addressing insider threats 34%, Improving employee cybersecurity awareness 33%, Addressing supplier risk 33%]
But a global economic downturn could make it more challenging for many 
organizations to achieve these aims. Over half (58%) of CISOs agree that recent 
economic events have hit their cybersecurity budget. The two sectors most affected 
are the public sector and IT, technology and telecoms (65% of CISOs in both 
reporting budget cuts).
No one can control global market forces. Still, organizations must not make rash 
budgetary decisions when concerns about cybersecurity preparedness are on the 
rise. CISOs must have a seat at the table when boards set spending priorities.
CISOs in retail (76%) 
are most confident 
that their organization 
has appropriate 
controls in place  
to mitigate supply 
chain risk.
CISOs in the UK 
(79%), France (73%) 
and Sweden (73%)

> It is imperative to have alignment with leadership on the need to provide resources that 
maintain a robust cybersecurity program, even when dealing with a difficult business 
climate. Our adversaries do not stop in an economic downturn—on the contrary, they step 
up their efforts knowing that organizations may put fewer resources into their defenses. 
Maintaining solid cybersecurity protections is always paramount because the threat 
landscape will only continue to expand.

## Chapter 5: Boards and CISOs—Closer to the Same Page
 
The issue of CISO and board member alignment is not new. But as the CISO role takes on greater influence, board-level 
interactions are more frequent—and relations appear to be improving as a result. 
A little under two-thirds (62%) of CISOs agree that their board sees eye to eye with 
them on cybersecurity issues. That’s up from 59% in 2021 and 51% in 2022. For 
their part, board members are even more positive about the relationship, with 69% 
feeling the same way.
As CISOs feel more at risk of a cyber attack and less prepared to cope with the 
consequences, they are beginning to feel more in tune with their boards—an 
encouraging sign. Both, no doubt, hope this trend can continue. And perhaps the 
slight drop in perceived positive relations in 2022 was little more than late-pandemic 
stress and strain.
![Percentage of CISOs by industry who agree their board sees eye to eye with them on the issue of cybersecurity: Retail 71%, Manufacturing and production 66%, Public sector 64%, IT, technology and telecoms 63%, Media, leisure and entertainment 62%, Business and professional services 61%, Healthcare 58%, Financial services 57%, Energy, oil/gas and utilities 55%, Education 52%, Transport 50%]
Even though relations are burgeoning, a slight disconnect remains around the consequences of a cyber attack. Based on their 
interactions, CISOs believe their boards’ greatest concerns to be:
- Reputational damage (36%) 
- Impact on business valuation (36%) 
- Loss of current customers (36%)
While all of these concerns are valid, they are slightly out of step with the top real-world impacts of data loss: 
- Operational downtime and data recovery (38%) 
- Financial loss (33%) 
- Regulatory sanctions (33%)
That said, many of the concerns held by CISOs and board members are interlinked. Operational downtime leads to reputational 
damage, impact on business valuation and loss of customers.
