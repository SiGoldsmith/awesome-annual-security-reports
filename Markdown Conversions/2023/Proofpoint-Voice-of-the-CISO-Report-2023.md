A Reality Check for CISOs
It’s no overstatement to say that the past year was a busy one in the world 
of cybersecurity. 
Ransomware continued to wreak havoc across the globe. New and increasingly 
devastating attacks upended organizations of every size, across every industry 
and in every jurisdiction. For example, a single ransomware attack contributed to 
the permanent closure of Lincoln College, a 157\-year\-old educational bastion in 
rural Illinois.1 On the other end of the spectrum, a series of attacks paralyzed the 
government of Costa Rica, forcing officials there to declare a national emergency.2 
The supply chain also found itself firmly in the sights of cyber criminals. Attackers 
doubled down on compromising third party, cloud and privileged identities to infiltrate 
networks and exfiltrate data.3 
Meanwhile, critical infrastructure hung in the balance amid a backdrop of unrelenting attacks and geopolitical unease. Russian 
attackers targeted U.S. airports,4 and Chinese\-aligned threat actors exploited telecoms’ vulnerabilities.5 
The prior year, with most pandemic disruption overcome, CISOs for a brief time appeared to feel a sense of calm, composure and 
confidence in their security posture. Astoundingly, that feeling has already vanished, replaced by elevated concern.
As we look to 2023 and beyond, we can expect a return to a harsher reality. Ransomware looks set to wreak more disruption as 
data extortion becomes the rule rather than the exception. At the same time, increasing commercialization of dark\-web exploit tools, 
initial\-access brokers and “as\-a\-service” attack infrastructures threaten to make cyber crime even more open to anyone with a few 
dollars and ill intent.
Amid growing concerns around cyber risk and organizational preparedness, navigating this threat landscape remains a matter of 
protecting people and defending data. Modern CISOs know that users are at the center of cybersecurity. And they understand how 
critical it is to safeguard their organization’s sensitive information, especially in light of an uncertain economy and employee churn.
To gain deeper insight into the mind of the CISO during this pivotal time, Proofpoint surveyed 1,600 of them from around the world. 
They graciously shared their experiences over the last year and their outlook for the years ahead.
In this summary of our findings, we explore how the global recession is applying pressure to security budgets and how CISOs 
must remain steadfast in pressing the C\-suite for critical controls to protect their organizations. We also learn how boards are 
increasingly becoming part of the cybersecurity conversation and the impact this is having on their understanding of security issues 
and their relationships with CISOs. Finally, we unpack the issue of burnout among CISOs as many struggle with the pressures of 
personal liability and excessive expectations.
Once again, this report would not have been possible without the insight offered by cybersecurity and information security 
professionals across the globe. We offer our sincere thanks for your time and your feedback.

Chapter 1: Back to "Business as Usual"
 
Last year’s report uncovered a palpable feeling among CISOs that there 
was a period of calm after a once\-in\-a\-generation crisis. With the pandemic 
disruption finally subsiding and hybrid work setups a mainstay for most, 
CISOs felt comfortable that the worst was behind them. At the time, just 48% 
believed that a cyber attack was on the horizon within the coming year. 
That’s changing. In this year’s survey, over two\-thirds (68%) of CISOs 
said they feel at risk of a material cyber attack in the next 12 months. 
This pronounced shift suggests that security professionals see the threat 
landscape heating up once again, and have recalibrated their level of 
concern to match.

Awareness vs Preparedness
Increased awareness among CISOs of the danger of a potential cyber attack can be 
viewed as a positive. But we found a concerning disconnect between the perceived 
likelihood of such an event and how prepared organizations are to deal with one.
Nearly two\-thirds (61%) agree that their organization is unprepared to cope with a 
targeted cyber attack. Once again, this is above 2022’s figure of 50% and more in line 
with 2021’s finding of 66%. This is further evidence that CISOs are returning to the 
“new normal”—though it’s a normal that offers little comfort.
For their part, board members are much 
more confident in their organization’s 
ability to deter cyber threats. In our survey 
of board members last year, just 47% 
believed they were unprepared for such 
an eventuality.6 But with CISOs having 
a better read of security posture and 
understanding of the threat landscape, this 
board\-level optimism is likely based on an 
incomplete picture of the current situation.

A CISO’s eye view of the threat landscape
When it comes to the kinds of threats occupying the minds of the world’s CISOs, four major categories lead the way:
• Email fraud (33%) 
• Insider threats (30%) 
• Cloud account compromise (29%) 
• DDoS attacks (29%)
This list is almost unchanged from the previous year (though email fraud and insider threats swapped places in the top two 
spots.) CISOs are right to remain concerned about these threats. Their continued prominence as a top priority reflects the 
challenge they continue to pose.
On a more positive note, CISO concerns seem to be filtering through to the rest of the C\-suite; board members agree that email 
fraud poses the most pressing threat.

Email fraud is the top concern

Among industries, business and 
professional (39%), public sector 
(38%), retail (35%) and IT, technology 
and telecoms (33%) all agree that 
email fraud will be the biggest threat 
over the next 12 months.
Organizations are finally back to ‘business as usual’ following years of coping with the 
pandemic and its aftermath. CISOs fully understand how critical their supply chains are 
and the significant impact of cyber\-attacks and ransomware on those supply chains. 
There is a need for a continuous and constantly evolving partnership between companies 
and their suppliers on the topic of cybersecurity that results in stronger requirements and 
cyber controls. Working collaboratively across sectors to raise the level of security yields 
benefits for all and creates greater deterrence for the adversaries.

Chapter 2: Protecting People—The Cybersecurity Cornerstone
 
Just as CISOs remain largely unchanged in their view of the threat landscape, they also hold their organization’s employees 
in a similar light to previous years. 
Almost two\-thirds (60%) consider human error to be their organization’s biggest 
cyber vulnerability. This is consistent with our findings in 2022 and 2021\. In those 
studies, 56% and 58%, respectively, agreed with the statement.
An even higher percentage of board directors (67%) shared this view. The finding 
suggests that the C\-suite now, if belatedly, recognizes the threat that CISOs have 
witnessed firsthand. This newfound awareness can only be good news.
Still, CISOs have expressed similar concerns about human vulnerability for several 
years now. Clearly, improving confidence in workers’ cybersecurity savviness 
remains a challenge.
Even more CISOs (63%) agree that human risk more broadly—including malicious and negligent employees—is a key 
cybersecurity concern in the next two years. This is most keenly felt in the UK, where 78% of CISOs agree, followed by:
• Japan (75%) 
• Brazil (72%) 
• Singapore (72%) 
• U.S. (68%) 
• Spain (68%)

The people problem
It is hardly surprising that people risk remains such a prominent concern among CISOs when just 61% believe that employees 
understand their role in protecting their employer. This leaves 2 in 5 CISOs ill at ease about whether their users are equipped to 
detect and deter cyber threats. 
Once again, this number is consistent with previous findings (60% in 2022 and 
58% in 2021\). The trend suggests little progress in building a culture of security 
awareness.
Countries with the highest percentage of CISOs who agree that “employees 
understand their role in protecting their organization against cyber threats,” include:
• France (79%) 
• Japan (75%) 
• UK (75%) 
• Spain (73%)
In our earlier survey, board members reported a greater level of confidence. More 
than 75% agreed that employees understand their role—a concerning disconnect 
about the perceived security posture of their people. 
This is likely because board directors can be sheltered from employees’ day\-to\-day actions, in many cases interacting only with 
higher\-ranking, well\-informed and top\-performing workers. By contrast, the CISO rightly has a closer ear to the ground—and a 
more realistic grasp of cybersecurity awareness and abilities throughout the organization.
CISOs in France (79%) have the 
most confidence that employees 
understand their role in protecting 
their organizations.
The belief that people are the biggest 
security vulnerability decreases as 
company size increases: 61% in those 
with 200\-499 employees and 47% in 
those with 5,000\+.
CISOs in retail (76%), transport 
(67%), IT, technology and telecoms 
(67%) and finance (67%) are most

Research consistently finds that human error is one of the key contributors to successful 
cyber attacks. As long as this vulnerability remains, CISOs will struggle to protect their 
data and systems. Although human error is inevitable, having guardrails, as well as strong 
policies and procedures in place, can go a long way in mitigating this risk and hardening 
your people perimeter.

Chapter 3: Defending Data 
 
Protect people, defend data: these are the keys tenets of any effective 
cybersecurity strategy. But unfortunately, organizations appear to 
struggle with both. 
Almost two\-thirds—63%—of global CISOs say they have had to deal 
with the loss of sensitive information in the past year. Bearing the brunt 
of data loss incidents are organizations in energy (71%), business and 
professional services (68%) and retail (68%).

Spotlight on malicious insiders
Although insider negligence edged out malicious and compromised users as the leading 
cause of data loss events last year, CISOs expect a reversal in the year ahead. Malicious 
(43%) and compromised (40%) insiders are deemed more likely to cause a data breach 
or exposure in the next 12 months. The finding suggests that CISOs increasingly believe 
that more employees are exposing data on purpose. The continuing impact of the Great 
Resignation—and more recently, mass layoffs—undoubtedly loom large in this assertion. 
Many industries saw a significant increase in post\-pandemic staff turnover. Some 82% 
of CISOs report that employees leaving their organization has contributed to a data 
loss event. The two sectors affected the most were retail (90%) and IT, technology and 
telecoms (88%).
These trends leave security teams with a near\-impossible challenge. When people leave, 
stopping them from taking data is difficult.
Some organizations require written guarantees from former employees that they will delete 
all company data. Others threaten the new employer of potential liability if the employee 
shares any data from the old job. But neither is close to being a satisfactory solution.
of CISOs agree that 
employees leaving 
their organization 
played a role in a 
data loss event.
82%
Organizations typically deploy a variety of security solutions and mitigating controls to protect 
against the loss of sensitive data, but they often overlook one factor—employees who leave for 
greener pastures often take the data with them. CISOs can’t solve this problem with technical 
controls alone, and this is where a strong security culture comes in. Educating employees, setting 
the expectations, garnering senior business leadership support—and then adding procedures and 
controls around it—can mitigate and eliminate some of the most common data leak problems.

Dealing with data loss
Against a backdrop of constant data loss across industries and countries, 60% of CISOs still contend that they have adequate 
data protections in place.
Board members are even more confident, with 75% believing this to be the case. 
However, this may due to CISOs sharing with them a well\-presented picture of 
events rather than the unfiltered reality.
Despite confidence in their current abilities, information protection and data 
governance remain a top priority going forward for 61% of the world’s CISOs. That’s 
a slight increase from 59% last year. 
Once again, board members feel more strongly, with 75% in agreement. Again, this 
is likely because of their limited view—board members focus on top\-line concerns 
rather than the numerous security issues CISOs deal with throughout the year. 
When it comes to the tools and protocols making up cyber defense, most CISOs report a broad and varied arsenal.

Chapter 4: Building a Defense to Fight on Every Front
 
Today’s CISOs face a fight on multiple fronts. They must combat external threats such as ransomware and supply chain risk to 
malicious, negligent and compromised insiders. For the most part, CISOs feel they have adequate resources to wage such a 
war. But many remain woefully overexposed. 
As supply chains grow larger and more complex, protecting these increasingly opaque networks is more difficult than ever. 
In spite of this, most CISOs say they have the issue under control. Some 64% believe they have appropriate controls in place 
to mitigate supply chain risk. This represents a modest increase from 2022 (59%), demonstrating that the issue remains a 
top priority.
Percentage of CISOs who agree their organization has 
appropriate controls in place to mitigate supply chain risk. 
When it comes to more direct attacks on their organization, CISOs are increasingly prepared to rely on insurers to limit the 
damage. Almost two\-thirds (61%) said they would place a claim on cyber insurance policies to recover losses incurred. Retail 
(75%) and IT, technology and telecoms (65%) are most likely to mitigate financial losses in this way. 
The World Economic Forum reports that 71% of organizations have cyber insurance in place,7 so this finding is no surprise. 
But relying on such policies alone is growing more complicated. 
For one, a recent increase in claims has led many insurers to raise premiums; some are withdrawing coverage for common 
threats like ransomware altogether.8 What’s more, while insurance can offer some financial compensation in the event of a data 
breach, it does little to rebuild customer trust or company reputation. 
This, along with an increase in more sophisticated and devasting ransomware attacks, may be why CISOs are increasingly 
open to paying ransoms to cyber criminals. 
Just 14% disagree that their organization is likely to pay a ransom to restore systems or prevent the release of data in the next 
12 months; 62% say the opposite.

This confidence is likely misplaced. While most organizations may have adequate endpoint detection and response technology, 
such tools will not alert on compromised credentials.

But a global economic downturn could make it more challenging for many

maintain a robust cybersecurity program, even when dealing with a difficult business 
climate. Our adversaries do not stop in an economic downturn—on the contrary, they step 
up their efforts knowing that organizations may put fewer resources into their defenses. 
Maintaining solid cybersecurity protections is always paramount because the threat 
landscape will only continue to expand.

Chapter 5: Boards and CISOs—Closer to the Same Page
 
The issue of CISO and board member alignment is not new. But as the CISO role takes on greater influence, board\-level 
interactions are more frequent—and relations appear to be improving as a result. 
A little under two\-thirds (62%) of CISOs agree that their board sees eye to eye with 
them on cybersecurity issues. That’s up from 59% in 2021 and 51% in 2022\. For 
their part, board members are even more positive about the relationship, with 69% 
feeling the same way.
As CISOs feel more at risk of a cyber attack and less prepared to cope with the 
consequences, they are beginning to feel more in tune with their boards—an 
encouraging sign. Both, no doubt, hope this trend can continue. And perhaps the 
slight drop in perceived positive relations in 2022 was little more than late\-pandemic 
stress and strain.
Percentage of CISOs by industry who agree their board sees 
eye to eye with them on the issue of cybersecurity.
Even though relations are burgeoning, a slight disconnect remains around the consequences of a cyber attack. Based on their 
interactions, CISOs believe their boards’ greatest concerns to be:
• Reputational damage (36%) 
• Impact on business valuation (36%) 
• Loss of current customers (36%)
While all of these concerns are valid, they are slightly out of step with the top real\-world impacts of data loss: 
• Operational downtime and data recovery (38%) 
• Financial loss (33%) 
• Regulatory sanctions (33%)
That said, many of the concerns held by CISOs and board members are interlinked. Operational downtime leads to reputational 
damage, impact on business valuation and loss of customers.

Given your interactions with the board, what do you believe are their greatest concerns 
with regard to a material cyber attack on the business? (Pick up to three.)
Room for improvement
Good feelings between CISOs and board members remains high, but it is 
still not quite a perfect marriage. Some 62% of CISOs believe cybersecurity 
expertise should be a board\-level requirement, suggesting that many believe 
technical knowledge is lacking in the boardroom. 
CISOs in retail (73%), IT, technology and telecoms (69%) and education (67%) 
believe in this view most strongly, while healthcare (50%) and transport (44%) 
are least likely to agree.
In the U.S., 70% of CISOs share this view. Perhaps not surprisingly, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has proposed requiring publicly 
traded companies to disclose whether any of their board directors have 
cybersecurity experience.

Whether such a rule will close the knowledge gap between CISOs and other board members remains to be seen. But 
many security professionals around the world will be keeping a close eye on it. An increased cybersecurity capability in the 
boardroom benefits all. And if existing board members can’t fulfil this role, that might mean greater career prospects for security 
professionals who can.

As regulatory scrutiny increases, board members are recognizing the crucial role played by 
their Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) in managing the mounting demands of cyber 
governance and oversight. By forging closer partnerships and aligning with their security experts, 
boards can effectively implement and oversee strategies that enhance their organization's 
cybersecurity and fortitude, positioning them to overcome emerging threats, challenges and 
ensuring shareholder value.

Chapter 6: Life as a CISO—In the Crosshairs, Burned Out 
and Under the Microscope
 
Cybersecurity’s role in helping to navigate the pandemic has undoubtedly brought 
with it some positives. CISOs now have more of a voice in the boardroom. And 
more than ever, they have been able to demonstrate the importance of effective 
security in driving business strategy. 
But it’s not all good news. Having enabled home and hybrid working suddenly 
and at scale in a time of crisis, many feel that the continued pressure on the role is 
unsustainable. 
Almost two\-thirds, 61%, of CISOs agree that they face excessive expectations. 
That’s up from 49% in 2022 and 57% in 2021\. A return to business as usual could 
be behind this growing concern. With the panic to secure home and hybrid setups behind them, many organizations are now 
tightening cybersecurity budgets. The shift leaves CISOs with the same objectives but fewer resources to achieve them. 
Across industries, those in retail (69%) and IT, technology and telecoms (69%) feel the heaviest expectations. Transport (48%) 
and healthcare (42%) CISOs feel the least pressure. The divergence suggests that the burden of security is spread more widely 
throughout safety\-critical industries.
of CISOs agree that 
there are excessive 
expectations on the 
CISO/CSO.
61%
CISOs have always had a stressful job, but the additional pressures—like board 
expectations to deliver risk reduction faster and challenges in influencing middle 
management on delivering it, budget challenges and shortages of skilled talent—are 
creating an untenable situation for many. That’s why more CISOs are changing roles or 
leaving the cybersecurity field altogether. Finding a better balance may sound impossible, 
given the 24/7 nature of the role, but it’s absolutely necessary for maintaining resilience in 
the face of burnout.

The burden of personal liability
Another significant contributor to the pressure felt by the world’s CISOs is the ever\-
present possibility of personal liability––62% expressed concern about the subject. 
Just 15% said it was not a worry in their current role.
The increased responsibility of the CISO has brought increased scrutiny from 
regulators. The failure of Uber’s former CISO to report a data breach resulted in a 
felony conviction. CISOs are well aware of what this verdict and others like it could 
mean for them, and they are seeking reassurance. 
Most CISOs (61%) say they would not join an organization that does not offer 
directors and officers (D\&O) insurance or something similar to protect them from financial liability stemming from a successful 
cyber attack. Just 14% disagree.
Understandably, CISOs in industries with high volumes of sensitive data or heavy regulation such as retail (69%), financial 
services (65%) and manufacturing (65%) are most likely to demand insurance coverage.

Unfortunately, the result of increased pressure, scrutiny and personal liability is 
all too inevitable. High\-stress environments, shrinking budgets and mounting 
expectations are hurting global CISOs’ quality of life. A full 60% say they have 
experienced burnout in the past 12 months. Just 15% disagree.
At the end of another blockbuster year for cybersecurity professionals, this is 
a critical finding. Once again, it underscores the need to stay grounded, both 
professionally and personally. 
The scale of the issue can’t be overstated. Forrester recently predicted that a 
Global 500 firm will be exposed for unsafe working conditions of its cybersecurity 
employees in 2023\.9 
The onus is on cybersecurity leaders to ensure that this does not happen on 
their watch. But this is possible only when CISOs are given the space to express 
concerns and the time to recharge and build resilience.

Conclusion
 
After the chaos and disruption of the first pandemic year, CISOs found themselves in a period of transition. Confidence in remote 
setups and understanding of the post\-pandemic threat landscape grew. So did belief in their ability to protect their organizations in 
this “new normal.”
But for CISOs, there’s no longer anything new about what has become a normal way of working. With the initial scramble 
behind them and two more years of remote work under their belts, it is back to reality. And with that comes a familiar state of 
elevated concern. 
CISOs are under no illusions about the risks posed by their people. But some are misplacing their confidence when it comes to 
protecting data. Insider threats are a growing problem. And as staff turnover shows no signs of slowing across many industries, it is 
likely to be an issue for some time. 
On top of this, security budgets are feeling the pinch of the economic downturn. Existing controls may be enough to mitigate 
supply chain risk, detect and remove threat actors, and cover potential losses from ransomware. But how long they will remain so is 
impossible to guess.
This return to a harsh reality culminates in CISOs feeling the strain. It’s no wonder that most are feeling the pressure of rising 
expectations, personal liability and burnout. 
But signs of hope remain. That CISOs are voicing these concerns is a huge step in the right direction. And with most feeling more 
aligned with board members, they have a solid foundation upon which to build and deliver change.
The question is, with shrinking budgets and long\-term talent shortages, will CISOs have the resources they need to do so?
CISOs are no strangers to challenges such as tight budgets, people\-driven risks and a 
growing threat landscape—most have been there before. But the positive shift we are 
seeing in board\-CISO relationships means security leaders now have new allies in their 
corner. Together, boards and CISOs have a solid opportunity to bolster their risk\-based 
cybersecurity strategies and drive meaningful changes. CISOs and their board allies may 
find it necessary to lend their support and provide sponsorship for business segments 
which may be struggling to find the capacity and prioritization necessary to implement 
these changes. In the dynamic cybersecurity environment, new challenges will always 
arise, and it is much easier to solve them when the two sides are working together in 
tandem toward a common goal.
