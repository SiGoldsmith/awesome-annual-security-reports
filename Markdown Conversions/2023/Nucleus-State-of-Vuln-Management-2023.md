Chapter One:
The Escalating Problem in Vulnerability Management

Six years ago, vulnerability exploitation was barely on people's 
radar as a factor in prioritization. Today, 37% of incidents start 
with vulnerability exploitation, according to a 2022 Mandiant 
M\-Trends report, making it the leading attack vector for initial 
access into organizations and a top cybersecurity risk, even 
bypassing phishing emails.

A separate report by Kaspersky revealed that there were more initial 
intrusions from exploitation of vulnerabilities in Internet\-facing applications 
in the last few years than there were breaches involving malicious emails and 
2
compromised accounts combined. — And unfortunately, this surge in 
exploitation isn’t ending anytime soon. 

Even when you look past initial attack vector, vulnerability exploitation is still 
involved in over half of breaches , making it a huge risk to organizations. And 
the problem only continues to balloon year over year...both in the speed at 
which attackers are capitalizing on exploited vulnerabilities, and in the way 
that technology and assets outgrow most organization’s current vulnerability 
management programs.

In this series, we’re going to be breaking down how vulnerability 
management has grown and evolved over time, plus how to modernize your 
program using things like risk\-based vulnerability management to actually 
get ahead of the problem and focus on the vulnerabilities that matter.

In the modern vulnerability management space, it is widely 
accepted that too many vulnerabilities are discovered and known 
within an organization to possibly resolve and fix all of them.

So, how did we get here in the first place? Over the last decade, organizations have significantly expanded 
the way that they use technology to do business, moving from solely focusing on network devices to 
steadily growing in their use of applications and cloud infrastructure. No surprise here, especially when 
you look at how many organizations made the rapid move to a digital workplace over the last few years. 

They've also increased the size of the teams that they have spinning up new systems and the number of 
assets being created, leading to the necessity of an aggregated approach simply to oversee it all.

However, as businesses themselves have accelerated, the corresponding maturity of their vulnerability 
management systems have been left in the dust. This is largely because, up until now, vulnerability 
management had primarily been a hands\-on task left to vulnerability management teams and system 
administrators to painstakingly work through, finding and patching issues one at a time. 

For many small and medium\-sized businesses, this is probably still the case. But for larger organizations 
with tens of thousands of employees (and just as many devices or assets), it’s physically not possible to 
hire enough people to triage and patch that many vulnerabilities quickly. 

You can no longer use a hands\-on approach
to tackle vulnerabilities

In 2022, there were more than 24,000\+ new vulnerabilities discovered globally. At this rate, the sheer 
number of new vulnerabilities coming into your system each day will always be greater than the number 
you are able to fix with a hands\-on approach. We see this in the fact that an average of 72% of 
vulnerabilities remain unpatched within 30 days, according to the Security Navigator 2023 report by 
Orange Cyberdefense.

Plus, this problem only gets 
greater as your business grows, 
as companies with 10,000\+ 
employees see the largest 
portion of medium and critical\- 
risk vulnerabilities, while 
medium\-sized organizations 
with 101–1,000 employees see 
the largest portion of high\-risk 
6
vulnerabilities. 

So, whether you’re facing a 
queue of 150,000 or 1,500,000 
vulnerabilities, it doesn’t 
matter how many your team 
fixes each day, month, or 
quarter, because the truth of it 
is, you’re never going to 
manually be able to fix your 
current vulnerabilities faster 
than the number of new ones 
coming in. That’s the actual 
problem we’re facing in 
vulnerability management 
today.

TOTAL VULNERABILITIES BY YEAR

You can't fix what you don't know
In addition to the escalation of new vulnerabilities easily overwhelming the strapped teams who are put in 
charge of overseeing and managing their assets, the scale of the data brought in by their related tools and 
vendors can also be overwhelming within the systems they use. This can be due to a lack of normalization 
among assets and systems, or a larger lack of visibility in general when it comes to finding, tracking, and 
patching vulnerabilities quickly. 

However, having clear oversight of your vulnerabilities is 
essential when it comes to vulnerability management 
because, without it, businesses cannot have full 
understanding over their risks, assets, connections, and 
requirements. It also puts pressure on already stretched
teams and can lead to serious gaps in management and 
execution over their vulnerability program.

Attackers are weaponizing vulnerabilities quicker

The sheer number of vulnerabilities that we are seeing each year is not the only thing leading to the 
escalation of vulnerability management problems. The time between the discovery and initial exploitation 
of a vulnerability is also becoming shorter, and the number of mass exploitations is increasing. 

7

78% of identified attack paths use known 
vulnerabilities (CVEs) as an initial attack 
vector. Palo Alto researchers found 
threat actors typically scan for systems 
with a just\-disclosed flaw minutes after 
2
the CVE is announced. 

For example, they observed an 
authentication bypass flaw in an F5 
network appliance (CVE\-2022\-1388\) 
being targeted 2,552 times in the first 10 
2
hours alone after vulnerability disclosure. 
In addition to searching for vulnerabilities 
quickly, attackers have also gotten faster 
at exploiting the vulnerabilities they find.

A study by Rapid7 showed that the mean time to known exploitation for vulnerabilities in 2021 was just
12 days — a 71% decrease from 42 days in 2020 — which they attribute to a sharp rise in zero\-day 
8
exploit activity. 

Time is money... so are unresolved vulnerabilities

As we stated earlier, vulnerability exploitation is involved in over half of all breaches, making it not just an 
overwhelming problem for your vulnerability team, but an expensive one for your entire company. The 
average cost of a data breach in the United States in 2022 was $9\.44m, with the US holding the record for 
the highest cost of data breaches for the 12th year in a row.

However, while the amount of time that it takes to identify and contain a breach is an average of 277 
days (or about 9 months), it’s been confirmed that shortening that amount of time to 200 days or less can
actually minimize the full cost of breaches for your organization. Companies who were able to contain
data breaches in under 200 days saw an average savings of $1\.12m, with organizations who had 
deployed AI and automation programs saving nearly $3\.05m in breach costs, as they were able to identify
and contain a breach 28 days faster than those who didn’t.

Conclusion
The Escalating Problem in Vulnerability Management

All of this just shows that traditional approaches to vulnerability management no longer provide sufficient 
defense against modern threats. The probability of a breach or compromise occurring due to vulnerability 
exploitation is higher than any other cyber attack vector, and the speed of vulnerability remediation is 
critical. However, with the increasing volume of new vulnerabilities discovered each day, the speed required
to stay ahead of attackers is only achievable with a risk\-based approach to vulnerability management. 

In the next chapter of our series, we’ll be tackling tackling how you can get better outcomes through 
precise and targeted vulnerability management, including how to use vulnerability intelligence and 
vulnerability decision trees for a more risk\-based approach.
