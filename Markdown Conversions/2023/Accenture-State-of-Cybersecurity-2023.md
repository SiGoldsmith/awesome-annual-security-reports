and cybersecurity is shifting with it—although,
not always fast enough to bring about elite performance.
The world has shifted

4
Market disruption—fueled by
technological change, complex
regulations, geopolitical
tensions and economic
uncertainties—is testing global
organizations’ approach to risk
and resilience.
As our Total Enterprise Reinvention
research shows, most large
organizations are transforming faster
and more frequently.
Our latest cybersecurity research
reveals some organizations are using
cybersecurity as a differentiator to
deliver better business outcomes. Those
organizations that closely align their
cybersecurity programs to business
objectives are 18% more likely to
increase their ability to drive revenue
growth, increase market share and
improve customer satisfaction, trust and
employee productivity.

## Securing transformation success
What’s more, organizations that embed
key cybersecurity actions into their digital
transformation efforts and apply strong
cybersecurity operational practices
across the organization are nearly six
times more likely to experience more
effective digital transformations than
those that don’t do both.
Yet, some organizations aren’t engaging
cybersecurity early enough to accelerate
transformation and meet future
challenges and opportunities.
We found that, when it comes to
embedding security controls, 18% of our
survey respondents still deploy them after
they’ve finalized a transformation effort—
and that’s only if vulnerabilities are
detected.
It could be a case of too little, too late. As
a recent study found, the discovery of an
error due to poor application security in
an app's coding phase, instead of during
initial planning, costs five times as much
to fix—and that soars to 30 times the cost
post-release.[^1]
The next wave of business
transformation will morph from
managing isolated digital capabilities to
creating the foundations of a shared
reality. It will converge the physical lives
we’ve been leading with the digital ones
we’ve been rapidly expanding. In such
an environment, organizations should
embed cybersecurity each step of the
way to better manage these high stakes.

5
By converting cybersecurity
from an incident-driven
reaction into part of the fabric
of transformation efforts,
organizations can not only
boost cybersecurity resilience,
but also position themselves
to reinvent the whole
enterprise and set a new
performance frontier, safely.

## Securing  transformation success

Survey responses show that
more than one-half of
organizations are beginning to
recognize the importance of
being secure from the start in
any transformation effort.
Our annual State of Cybersecurity Resilience research involved
3,000 global respondents from 15 industries across 14 countries.

## Cybersecurity as a changemaker

We discovered that the majority of organizations undergoing digital
transformation, in our sample, increase their chances of being fully satisfied
with the level of cybersecurity embedded in their digital transformation
efforts by 10% if they follow three actions.

### Three cybersecurity actions to boost transformation:

## Cybersecurity as a changemaker
Assign a cybersecurity representative to
the core transformation team and a point
person to orchestrate cybersecurity
across all transformation initiatives
1.
Require cybersecurity controls before
all new solutions are deployed
2.
3.
Apply cybersecurity incrementally
as each digital transformation
milestone is achieved

9
Our recently released Resilience for Reinvention study[^2] shows that companies
achieving long-term profitable growth display a commitment toward developing
a digital core, which consists of three layers: infrastructure and security; data and
artificial intelligence (AI); and applications and platforms.

consistently higher share of
investments in new technologies,

In this latest State of Cybersecurity Resilience research, we find that some organizations—
representing 30% of respondents—are already proving how prioritizing cybersecurity makes
a difference. These organizations—we call them cyber transformers—have accelerated digital
transformation efforts and plan to continue accelerating them as their high-performing
cybersecurity actions propel them forward (Figure 1).

And like the cyber champions in our 2021 report, this year’s cyber
transformers strike a balance between excelling at cyber resilience and
aligning with the business strategy to achieve better business outcomes.

73%
of cyber transformers involve the
cybersecurity team from the start of
business planning
37%
of the rest involve the

Additionally, cyber
transformers are nearly twice
as good as the rest at
involving the cybersecurity
team from the start of
business planning. And they
are far more comfortable with
their organization’s internal
cybersecurity planning.

*   Their ability to achieve target revenue growth and market share
*   Improved customer satisfaction and trust
*   Greater employee productivity

Cyber transformers closely align cybersecurity programs to business objectives.
In doing so, they are 18% more likely to increase the following outcomes:

## Cybersecurity as a changemaker
13
Cyber transformers
build transformation
foundations in two ways
They not only embed three key
cybersecurity actions into their
transformation efforts, but also
establish a better foundation
by applying strong
cybersecurity operational
practices from the start. As a
result, they are 5.8X more likely
to experience more effective
digital transformations than the
rest (Figure 2).

Cyber transformers outperform the rest using
strong cybersecurity operational practices.

## Cybersecurity as a changemaker
Excel at integrating
cybersecurity and risk
management
Leverage cybersecurity as-a-
service more frequently to
enhance security operations
More committed to
protecting their ecosystems
from external attacks
Rely more heavily on
automation

15
16
There are several factors that illustrate the differences
between cyber transformers and the rest.

65% of cyber transformers apply three
leading practices to excel at risk
management. By contrast, just 11% of the
rest adopt this “best-in-class” approach.
1.
Integrate cyber risk: A cyber risk-based
framework is completely integrated into
their enterprise risk management program
2. Agree on priorities: Their cybersecurity
operations and executive leadership
consistently agree on the priority of assets
and operations to protect
3. Look at risk holistically: They consider
cybersecurity risk to a great extent when
evaluating overall enterprise risk
1

For example, by choosing to integrate
cybersecurity risk into its broader enterprise
risk management framework, a global travel
company was able to gain better risk
management, improved compliance with
regulatory requirements and enhanced
protection for its business and its customers.
This industry-leading and comprehensive
approach to enterprise risk management
enabled the company to gain a deeper,
holistic understanding of the security risks
associated with third-party vendors and IT
systems, as well as better preparedness and
recovery planning in the event of a breach.

## What it takes to be a cyber transformer
Cyber transformers more frequently use
cybersecurity-as-a-service to enhance operations.
40% of cyber transformers use third
parties or managed services
providers to administer cybersecurity
operations and address talent
shortages, versus 24% of the rest.
When a North American retail chain
became a standalone public company,
it needed to rethink its IT operations.
Accenture was asked to support the
retailer’s focused security team by
expanding into a cybersecurity-as-a-
service model, initially running the
company’s security operations, such as
threat intelligence and establishing a
Security Operations Center (SOC).
Today, Accenture provides a range of
services including data protection,
identity management, network security,
vulnerability management, security
awareness and risk management.
Improving its cybersecurity operations
enabled the company to innovate
continuously, run its store operations
without disruption and maintain
consumer trust. The retailer gained
improved cyber resilience and business
outcomes by being secure from the start.

### Case study

## What it takes to be a cyber transformer
Cyber transformers are more committed
to protecting their ecosystem.
Based on our analysis, cyber
transformers performed better than
the rest when it comes to taking
action to protect their ecosystems.
For example, cyber transformers more often
incorporate their ecosystem or supply chain
partners into their incident response plan (45%
vs. 37%) and also require them to meet strict
cybersecurity standards (41% vs. 29%). While
these ecosystem actions provide cyber
transformers with a 10% advantage over the
rest, there is room for improvement.

A leading pharmaceutical
company collaborated with Amazon
Web Services (AWS) to accelerate drug
development, increase operational
agility, reduce technology costs and
develop the workforce of the future.
To create a more scalable, reliable and
secure architecture, the company
moved 80% of its applications to the
cloud, removing non-differentiating
technology, reducing its internal data
center footprint, decreasing capital
expenditures and improving resilience.
Customers, employees and partners can
benefit from the company’s ability to
respond with greater speed, agility and
insights across the value chain which, in
turn, improves patient experiences.
Accelerating the delivery of data services
and capabilities can help the company
increase secure connectivity and
collaboration with the Life Sciences
ecosystem and external partners.

### Case study
19
## What it takes to be a cyber transformer
Cyber transformers rely heavily on automation.
89% of cyber transformers rely
heavily on automation, compared
with just 57% of the rest.
What’s more, 96% of respondents whose
organizations substantially automate their
cybersecurity programs recognize that
automation helps them alleviate cyber talent
shortages, a key challenge for any company
seeking cyber resilience. As evidence of a
man+machine approach becoming more
mainstream, Accenture analysis has found
that the share of cybersecurity-related AI
patents increased 2.7X between January
2017 and October 2022.
In our own organization of 738,000
employees, we’ve embraced AI and
automation through our Intelligent
Application Security Platform. The
platform uses leading commercial
scanning tools to perform application
security testing at scale and to discover
vulnerabilities and code issues. It also
automates, orchestrates and scales
onboarding applications as well as
application testing and pipeline gating.
The platform uses an artificial
intelligence-powered filter that
removes and reduces vulnerabilities—
from several thousand to a few—
resulting in a curated and more
manageable process.
As a result, the scanning service has
helped application teams save
thousands of hours through the
automated removal of false positive
findings generated by scanning tools.

20
### Case study
Fast-emerging AI
developments such as
generative AI can drive a new
wave of cybersecurity
advances.
In time, generative AI could support enterprise
governance and information security, protecting
against fraud, improving regulatory compliance,
and proactively identifying risk by drawing cross-
domain connections and inferences both within
and outside the organization.[^3]
Indeed, the emergence of ChatGPT has already
brought both disruption and opportunity, offering
the rapid advancement of cybersecurity
capabilities such as threat detection, analysis and
response and accelerated use of automation to
reduce workload and augment staffing.

## What it takes to be a cyber transformer
As one CISO noted:
> There is an argument for automating
> Security Operations Center (SOC) level-
> one support—things like creating Yara
> rules and more complex queries.
> Generative AI already has this capability.
> However, I believe you’re still going to
> need human oversight.”

21
## What it takes to be a cyber transformer
As our research shows, Total Enterprise Reinvention is a deliberate
strategy that aims to set a new performance frontier for companies and
in most cases, the industries in which they operate.
Cyber transformers are well placed
to execute that reinvention strategy
through gains that are a direct result
of differentiated cybersecurity
practices and behaviors.
And while cybersecurity incidents will still
happen every day, on average, cyber
transformers report 26% lower cost of
breaches and cybersecurity incidents in the
past 12 months than the rest—that’s more than
a quarter of all costs that could be allocated
across the enterprise to optimize operations,
fuel growth and improve resilience.

A large retail and commercial bank
introduced agile cybersecurity decision
making while undertaking two digital
transformations: moving to a private
cloud and creating new product
offerings using the public cloud.
The bank’s decentralized operating
model, coupled with embedding
cybersecurity early in the digital
transformation process, has helped to
reduce risks and vulnerabilities, improve
data protection and enhance its overall
security posture.
What’s more, the bank has reduced costs
and downtime while improving
compliance—and enhancing its reputation
as a secure and trustworthy organization.

### Case study

23
While managing secure digital transformation is an important consideration, our
research shows there are other ongoing issues that continue to put pressure on all
organizations and influence the state of cybersecurity resilience. Looking across our
entire set of global respondents, these additional pressure points were revealed.

## Extra pressure points
24
Organizations’ cyber resilience is
under pressure from ongoing
geopolitical tensions, especially
through their supply chains, physical
infrastructure and external networks.
An uncertain geopolitical landscape is
accelerating threats and attacks
Organizations are failing to keep pace
with the scope and scale of cyber risk.
The whole approach to cyber risk is
under scrutiny, inside and outside
Organizations are better aligning
cybersecurity with business leadership,
but there are gaps in the effectiveness
of their approach.
There’s still room for improvement in
cybersecurity and business alignment
An uncertain geopolitical landscape is
accelerating threats and attacks
Organizations’ cyber resilience is
under pressure from ongoing
geopolitical tensions, especially
through their supply chains,
physical infrastructure and
external networks, such as
investment partners.
The influence of Russia’s aggression in the
Ukraine is being felt by almost everyone.
Nearly all organizations (97%) have seen an
increase in cyber threats since the start of
the Russia-Ukraine war and almost all survey
respondents have taken some action.
51% of organizations have updated their
business continuity and enterprise risk plans
and nearly half have increased their incident
response capabilities. At the same time, only
39% of organizations are prioritizing close
collaboration with government agencies on
policies and recommendations in response
to the war. More than half (54%) see third
parties and external networks as the most
susceptible areas for attack.
Indeed, consistent with last year’s findings,
the percentage of successful breaches from
outside the organization remains high, even
nudging slightly ahead (61% compared to
60% last year), while for some industries,
such as Utilities, supply chain partner threats
are higher again at 62%.

25
## Extra pressure points
The whole approach to cyber risk is under
scrutiny, inside and outside

## Extra pressure points
Organizations are failing to
keep pace with the scope
and scale of cyber risk.
Cyber risk management is
challenging inside the
organization. Less than half of all
survey respondents said that just
one aspect of enterprise risk
management—their cyber risk-
based framework—is completely
integrated within the enterprise
risk management program.
The regulatory landscape plays a
part here, with risk integration
leaping to 81% in the highly
regulated Banking industry or
65% for the Software and
Platforms sector.
And accelerating transformation
without addressing security along
the way can open the door to
greater risk.
While 35% of respondents said
they embed security controls in all
transformation initiatives from the
beginning, there are still 18% who
deploy security after the event. To
transform at speed, security should
be baked in, otherwise
organizations can expect to incur
more cost or rework down the
line (Figure 3).
Cyber risk is also mounting outside
the organization, where cyber
threats are increasing due to
changes in the threat landscape
and cybersecurity omissions leave
organizations exposed.

Deploy security after transformation is initialized
only if vulnerabilities are detected, ensuring we can
move transformation as fast as possible
Implement security controls, only for critical
functions, balancing speed and risk management
Embed security controls in all transformation
initiatives from the beginning
Figure 3. The security of digital transformation efforts
For example, Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine spurred reaction from
executives to address
cybersecurity practices, such as
updates to business continuity,
incident response and increasing
employee cyber awareness.
Indeed, only one-third of all
respondents (35%) consider
cybersecurity risk “to a great
extent” when evaluating overall
enterprise risk; this highlights
there is still some way to go to
make cybersecurity a proactive,
strategic necessity within
the business.

There’s still room for improvement in
cybersecurity and business alignment

## Extra pressure points
Organizations are better at aligning
cybersecurity with business
leadership, but there are gaps in the
effectiveness of the approach.
Business leaders (CEO and CFO respondents
in the research) expect CISOs to go beyond
their traditional technical role to act as a
representative of the organization. Business
leaders reported the importance of CISOs
adopting certain characteristics, such as
translating the technical aspects of
cybersecurity to the CEO and Board (44%),
leading the response during breaches (42%)
and establishing trust with customers (41%).
These findings underscore the importance
of having a business-led CISO who acts as
an educator and collaborator with non-
security audiences.
In particular, there’s a gap between CISOs
and business leaders when it comes to a
post-breach communication strategy to the
general public. And yet, as every
organization who has experienced an attack
knows, in the middle of a crisis, it’s critical to
provide quick, transparent communications
to inform and reassure stakeholders.
Nearly half of CISOs said that no defined
executive was responsible for
communicating externally during a breach.
As one CISO reported:
> The biggest hurdle security
> leaders have is executive
> presence. You need to
> demonstrate business
> capability and value and
> engage in conversations
> that are about more than
> just security.”

27
There’s still room for improvement in
cybersecurity and business alignment

## Extra pressure points
In addition, the differences in opinion
between CISOs and business leaders
about this responsibility may indicate a
lack of clarity for post-breach
communication (Figure 4).
This is a red flag for the whole enterprise
as it attempts to limit the damage of a
breach to its brand and customer
satisfaction scores, identified as the most
important consideration following a
breach by 50% of our survey respondents.
Organizations have a responsibility to
define a crisis communications strategy
that is agile, that considers the
complexities of cyber events and that
clearly defines roles and responsibilities for
communicating with stakeholders.

Realistically, if you’re not looking at
cybersecurity holistically, you’re not
fully protecting your business

30
## Where next?
Security is critical to enabling business
agility and scalability as well as driving
continued innovation and establishing an
organization’s digital core—one that
empowers employees and departments to
experiment and scale while mitigating risk.
What you can do: Take the three
cybersecurity actions and establish a
strong foundation with cybersecurity
operational practices
to improve business outcomes and
overall performance.
The traditional approach to
cybersecurity is unsustainable. A global
shortage of cybersecurity talent to
handle ongoing threats is compounded
by fewer people available to handle the
effects of cyberattacks on an
organization’s business continuity,
economics and reputation. The lines are
becoming blurred around when
transformation begins and ends.
What you can do
Make cybersecurity a cornerstone of
your transformation efforts and elevate
the CISO reporting so that the function
is fundamental to business
transformation efforts.

31
Increased access, devices, software and
connectivity across the Cloud Continuum
and legacy environments has resulted in
an ever-expanding threat surface. And
while generative AI[^4] can herald a new era
of agility and cyber protection, it also acts
as a new threat vector for cyber criminals.
What you can do
Invest in understanding your data, its value
and who has access. Re-examine
enterprise and customer identity to better
bridge the physical and digital worlds.
Establish enhanced monitoring and
visibility across both legacy and cloud
environments using endpoint detection
and response (EDR) and security
orchestration, automation and response
(SOAR) technologies.
Embed cybersecurity to
protect the digital core
Apply cybersecurity to
reconcile digital and
physical worlds
Make cybersecurity
part of the fabric of
transformation
Here’s how you can employ cybersecurity to drive better results

## Where next?
From risk assessment and management to
security control implementation, and from
security awareness and training to
incident response and recovery,
cybersecurity is essential to maintain
dynamic protection in every
transformation program. What’s more, as
our cyber transformers show, business
leaders have an opportunity to make
cybersecurity’s impact extend beyond
protecting the business in the here and
now, to actively influence continuous,
dynamic reinvention.

Our State of Cybersecurity
Resilience 2023 research involved
3,000 global respondents from 15
industries across 14 countries. We
wanted to understand the role of
cybersecurity in organizations’
approach to transformation and the
broader cybersecurity practices that
facilitate secure digital
transformation. The respondents
represent organizations with annual
revenues of $1 billion or more across
North and South America, Europe
and Asia Pacific.

Methodology
Survey data analysis
We used standard survey data analysis to understand the
overall landscape as well as characteristics of various
groups in our sample; in particular we compared cyber
transformers who made up 30% of the security executives
in the sample (741 respondents) and the rest of the security
executives (1,759 respondents). We defined cyber
transformers as organizations that have accelerated digital
transformation efforts and plan to continue accelerating
them over the next two years.
Composite indicators
We constructed two independent indexes to capture how
advanced companies are in more complex areas.
1.
Ecosystem protection index. Incorporates our survey
data and is based on the number of positive answers to
questions on ecosystem protection actions that an
organization is taking. Equal weighting was applied. The
index is distributed on a scale 0-100.
2.
Alignment and governance index. Using last year’s
definition of alignment, we applied this year’s survey
data to construct the index. The index is based on
answers to questions on how organizations align their
security to business objectives and what governance
practices they apply. Equal weighting was applied. The
index is distributed on a scale 0-100 and was part of
the metric used in our logistic regression analysis.
NLP and trend analysis of publicly available data
We used LexisNexis patents data in our Natural Language
Processing (NLP) approach to select patents related to
cybersecurity, including AI. Using publication data between
January 2017 and October 2022, we ran trend analysis to
understand the evolution of AI-related patents’ share in the
overall number of cybersecurity-focused patents.

35
Logistic regression econometric algorithm
To estimate the relationship between the probability of a
successful outcome and organizations’ practices, we
applied a logistic regression approach. Both models
were controlled with respect to the organizations’ size,
geographic location and the industry where they operate:
1.
Business outcomes analysis—we analyzed the
relationship between the level of business alignment
and governance, measured with the alignment and
governance index, and the probability that a company
positively impacts with cybersecurity in all of the
following outcomes:
*   Increased ability to achieve target revenue growth
*   Increase in market share
*   Increase in customer satisfaction and trust
*   Increase in employee productivity.
2.
Secure transformation efforts analysis—we looked at
the probability of being highly satisfied with secure
transformation efforts. We tested the relationship with
secure transformation key practices for selected
cohorts in the survey sample.
Reinvention is the strategy. It is no
longer an execution lever.
The digital core becomes a primary
source of competitive advantage. It
leverages the power of cloud, data, and AI
through an interoperable set of systems
across the enterprise that allows for rapid
development of new capabilities.
Reinvention goes beyond benchmarks,
embracing the art of the possible.
Technology and new ways of working
create a new performance frontier.
Talent strategy and people impact
are central to reinvention, not an
afterthought. These companies consider
change management a core competency.
Reinvention is boundaryless and breaks
down organizational silos. It tackles
capabilities end-to-end.
Reinvention is continuous. It is no longer
a time-defined one-off, but a capability
continuously tapped by the organization.
Total Enterprise Reinvention is a deliberate
strategy that aims to set a new performance
frontier for companies and in most cases,
the industries in which they operate.
Centered around a strong digital core, it
helps drive growth and optimize operations.
It requires a strategy for continuous,
dynamic reinvention. It becomes a unifying
force, across the C-suite and every function
and business area, because, by definition, all
are involved and accountable for its
success. It demands an outside-in
perspective that connects what’s happening
at the organization with what’s happening in
the world. And it requires new skills and an
increased depth of understanding of
technology, change management,
communication and how to work with
partners to achieve results faster (Figure 5).
Compressed transformation is transforming
multiple parts of the business at the same
time or executing a single large
transformation much faster than ever before.
Digital core is fundamental to all other
strategic needs of an enterprise. Amplifying
the role of technology in reinvention means
shifting from a technology landscape of static,
standalone parts to interoperable pieces
intentionally integrated and leveraging the
cloud. The digital core consists of three layers:
an infrastructure and security layer; a data and
AI layer; an applications and platforms layer.
Building a strong digital core is not a one-time
project. It must be continuous to incorporate
new technologies and business capabilities.

of Total Enterprise Reinvention
