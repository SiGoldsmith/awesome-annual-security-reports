The State of Cybersecurity 2023: The Business Impact of Adversaries 

Executive Summary
Situation: Adversaries Are Accelerating, and Defenders 
Are Unable to Keep Up

The study revealed that today’s reality is a two\-speed cybersecurity system with 
adversaries and defenders moving at different speeds. Through automation, 
cybercrime “as\-a\-service” models, stealthy impersonation, and adaptation, 
adversaries are accelerating and can now execute a wide range of sophisticated 
attacks at scale. With 94% of organizations experiencing a cyberattack of some 
form in the last year, all companies – regardless of size or revenue – should 
assume they will be a target in 2023\. 

Slowed by a shortage of expertise, an overwhelming volume of alerts, and 
too much time spent on incident response, defenders are unable to keep up. 
Operationalizing threat detection and response is difficult for most organizations, 
with 93% finding the execution of essential security operations tasks challenging. 

Investigating security alerts is a widespread issue. On average, just under half 
(48%) of all alerts are investigated to determine whether they are signs of 
malicious activity, and most organizations struggle to identify (71%) and prioritize 
(71%) which alerts/events to investigate. For the alerts that require it, the full 
detection, investigation and response process takes nine hours on average for 
organizations with 100\-3,000 employees, rising to 15 hours for those with 3,001\-
5,000 employees. 

Operationally, defenders lack confidence in their processes, with security tool 
misconfiguration identified as the top perceived security risk in 2023\. Over half 
(52%) of IT professionals say that cyberthreats are now too advanced for their 
organization to deal with on their own, rising to 64% among small businesses 
(100\-250 employees). 

Business Impact: The Situation Has Financial, Operational 
and Resourcing Consequences

This two\-speed system has a considerable impact on the wider organization. 
The direct financial repercussions of a cyber incident are huge and already well\-
known, with the average cost to a small or mid\-sized organization to remediate a 
ransomware attack coming in at $1\.4 million1\. These incident clean\-up costs are, 
however, just part of the story.

Capacity for IT program delivery is reduced, with 55% of respondents reporting 
that dealing with cyberthreats has negatively impacted the IT team’s work on 
other projects. The urgent and unpredictable nature of cybersecurity also gets 
in the way of business\-focused efforts: 64% wish the IT team could spend more 
time on strategic issues and less time on firefighting. 

The lengthy time spent on detecting, investigating and remediating security 
alerts also has a considerable financial impact in terms of the resourcing cost. 

The situation also creates a heavy burden on employees. 57% of IT professionals 
say that worrying about the organization being hit by a cyberattack sometimes 
keeps them up at night, rising to 65% among those working in organizations with 
3,001\-5,000 employees. Given the high costs of recruiting, training, and retaining 
staff in this space, these repercussions create additional challenges and costs 
for the business.

Recommendation: Accelerate the Defender Flywheel to 
Move Ahead of Adversaries

Key findings

Enabling defenders to overtake attackers in the 2023 cybersecurity race requires 
a comprehensive, but straightforward approach. Firstly, organizations need to set 
up an incident response process that can scale, achieved through minimizing 
the attack surface and the volume of alerts that require attention, and optimizing 
response time by leveraging specialist services. 

Next, they need to implement adaptive defenses that automatically adjust to the 
situation. This allows them to slow down adversaries and buy defenders time to 
respond. 

Finally, they also need to set up a virtuous cycle that combines technology and 
human expertise to turbo\-charge defenses, enabling an increase in speed, 
efficacy, and impact. Together they accelerate the defender flywheel, enabling 
them to pull ahead. 

Central to the success of this approach is the use of third\-party specialists. 
The good news is that organizations already have a blended approach to 
cybersecurity delivery, with 94% of companies working with external specialists 
in some capacity to scale their operations. As adversaries ramp up their efforts, 
engaging with dedicated security operations expertise is increasingly essential.

Cyberthreats 2023: 
Reality from the Front Lines
Top Cyberthreat Concerns for 2023

99% of IT professionals are concerned about cyberthreats affecting their 
organization in 2023\. Data exfiltration (theft by an external attacker) tops 
the list of threats that IT professionals are most concerned about affecting 
their organization, closely followed by phishing (including spear phishing). 
Ransomware rounds out the top three placements. 

It’s important to remember that these three threats are often interlinked: 
a phishing email often starts an attack that results in data exfiltration and 
ransomware.

Adversaries Now Execute Myriad Attacks at Scale

The concerns of IT professional closely match the reality of what is 
happening on the front lines with 94% of organizations experienced at least 
one cyberattack in the last year. While ransomware was the most reported 
attack, adversaries execute a wide range of attacks at scale. This breadth and 
depth of attacks creates a considerable and growing challenge for defenders.

Behind these numbers is the increasing professionalization of the 
cybercriminal economy, including the growth of the ‘as a service’ model, 
including ‘access\-as\-a\-service’, ‘phishing\-as\-a\-service’, and ‘scamming\-as\-
a\-service.’ This evolution in cybercrime operations has lowered the barriers 
to entry for would\-be cybercriminals. \[For more information, read the Sophos

Active Adversary Attacks Are Now Commonplace

23%
of organizations experienced 
an attack involving an Active 
Adversary in the last year

30%
say Active Adversaries are 
one of their top cyberthreat 

concerns for 2023

Active adversaries are threat actors who adapt their techniques, tactics, and 
procedures (TTPs) on the fly using real\-time hands\-on\-keyboard actions in 
response to actions by security technologies and defenders, and as a tactic to 
evade detection. These attacks, which often result in devastating ransomware and 
data breach incidents, are among the hardest to stop. 

23% of respondents reported that their organization experienced an attack 
involving an active adversary last year. The attack rate was consistent regardless of 
organization size, varying by only two percentage points across all organization size 
segment splits. 

Interestingly, for organizations with less than $10 million in annual revenue, the 
rate of reported active adversary attacks dropped to just 11%, which may indicate 
that attackers are deliberately focusing on targets with deeper pockets. Detecting 
active adversaries requires a high level of skill and it is likely that the actual rate of 
incidents is higher. 

Reflecting the potential devastation of these attacks, 30% of respondents reported 
that active adversaries are one of their top cyberthreat concerns for 2023\.

Understanding Active Adversaries

To appreciate the challenge facing defenders, it’s essential to understand that 
blocking active adversaries is not enough to thwart them. These skilled and 
persistent threat actors deploy multiple techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) 
to achieve their goals, including:

 Ì Exploiting security weaknesses to penetrate organizations and 

move laterally once inside the network, including stolen credentials, 
unpatched vulnerabilities, and security tool misconfigurations, 

 Ì Abusing legitimate IT tools used by defenders to avoid triggering detections, 

 Ì Modifying their attacks in real\-time in response to security controls, by 

continuing to pivot to new techniques until they find a way to achieve their goals.

Top Cyber Risk Concerns 

Security control misconfigurations (e.g., of an endpoint or firewall solution) are the 
most widely reported perceived security risk, with 27\.4% of respondents including 
it in their top three cyber vulnerabilities. This top ranking illustrates the challenges 
IT teams face in ensuring that their security controls remain correctly configured 
and deployed at all times, and the readiness with which adversaries exploit any 
gap in an organization’s defenses. 

Zero\-day attacks, i.e., attacks that take advantage of a previously unknown 
security vulnerability or software flaw, are in second position, rated a top three 
security risk at 26\.8%. A shortage of in\-house cybersecurity skills/expertise is 
third on the list, rated a top three security risk by 25% of respondents.

Differing Approaches to Alert Investigation

Detection, Investigation and Response Overhead

Organizations investigate 48% of their security 
alerts to identify if they are signs of malicious activity

One of the challenges for defenders is identifying which alerts to investigate and 
how to use their limited resources to best effect.

On average, just under half (48%) of all security alerts are investigated to identify 
whether they are signs of malicious activity, rising to 54% in organizations with 
3,001\-5,000 employees. However, approaches differ greatly: 16% of organizations 
investigate more than three quarters of their alerts (including 5% who report they 
investigate all alerts) while 18% investigate a quarter or fewer. 

From a sector perspective, central/federal government investigates the lowest 
percentage of alerts (39%) (n\=89\) while energy, oil/gas and utilities investigates 
the highest (55%) (n\=69\). 

The median time to detect, investigate, and respond to an alert is nine hours for 
organizations with 100\-3,000 employees, rising to 15 hours for organizations 
with 3,001\-5,000 employees, likely reflecting the increased complexity of their 
operating environments. 

The survey revealed considerable variation by industry, with organizations in the 
manufacturing and production (15 hours) and energy, oil/gas and utilities (18 
hours) sectors taking more than twice as long as those in IT, technology and 
telecoms (6\.75 hours). 

It’s important to note that the majority of alerts will not reach the response stage. 
Most attacks will be blocked proactively by security technologies with a subset of 
alerts triaged and brought forward for investigation. Response actions will also vary 
considerably due to the nature of the event that requires remediation, from deleting 
a phishing email from users' inboxes to rebuilding an entire server farm.

Organizations Lack Essential Security Operations Skills

As already seen, IT professionals consider the shortage of in\-house cybersecurity 
skills/expertise to be one of their biggest security risks for 2023\. Diving deeper, 
the survey reveals that the majority of organizations struggle with the day\-to\-
day delivery of core security operations tasks, with 93% rating at least one of the 
following activities as 'challenging':

 Ì Identifying signals from noise (71% find challenging)

 Ì Prioritizing which signals/alerts to investigate (71% find challenging) 

 Ì Getting sufficient data to identify if a signal is 
malicious or benign (71% find challenging)

 Ì Remediating malicious alerts or incidents in a timely way (71% find challenging) 

 Ì Identifying the root cause of the incident (75% find challenging)

 Ì Keeping accurate records of investigations (68% find challenging)

Identifying the root cause of the incident is the most widespread issue, with 75% of 
respondents reporting that they find it challenging. 

Organizations with the lowest annual revenue (below $10 million) are most likely 
to find security operations tasks challenging, followed by those with the largest 
revenue ($5 billion \+). Both ends of the spectrum will face different obstacles, 
with organizational and system complexity likely to play a greater role in larger 
organizations.

This skills shortage creates a domino effect: investigating alerts takes longer, which, 
in turn, reduces the capacity of the team and increases risk exposure.

businesses (100\-250 employees). 

As organizational revenue increases, so does the likelihood that in\-house 
teams cannot keep up. This likely reflects the greater complexity of the internal 
cybersecurity environment in larger revenue organizations and a greater 
propensity to engage specialist security services. It may also reflect a greater 
understanding of the threat environment and the challenges in defending 
against advanced threats.

Financial Impact

Team Impact

The challenging cybersecurity environment has multiple financial impacts for 
an organization. The highest individual bills occur in the event of a major cyber 
incident. As reported in the Sophos State of Ransomware 2022 report, the 
average ransomware remediation bill comes in at $1\.4 million.

57% of respondents say that worrying about the organization being hit by a cyberattack 
sometimes keeps them up at night. Given the high costs of recruiting and retaining 
staff in this space, this is a cause of both welfare and economic concern. It also 
suggests that defenders do not have full confidence in their security tools.

However, the financial impact of dealing with cyberattacks is not limited to the 
clean\-up costs. With the average IT Security Specialist salary in the U.S. currently 
just shy of $100,000 per year2, the hourly resource cost for each security alert 
investigation is considerable. While salaries will vary based on local conditions, 
the financial impact of the lengthy incident investigation process is considerable.

Burn out is a major issue in cybersecurity. Too many alerts and having too much to do 
puts considerable stress on employees. Over\-stretched teams are more likely to miss 
important signals, adding further pressure. Ultimately, people will eventually break. 

The propensity for cybersecurity worries to stop people from sleeping increases 
steadily as organization revenue grows, starting at 43% of those in organizations with 
less than $10 million annual revenue and rising to 67% in organizations that turn over 
$5 billion or more.

Recommendations

Strong Shields Are Essential

Addressing the situation requires a straightforward three\-step approach: 
implement a more scalable incident response process that accelerates response 
time; leverage adaptive defenses to slow down adversaries; and create a virtuous 
cycle that improves protection and lowers cost. 

A “Shields Up” analogy is useful here. Stopping advanced, persistent adversaries 
requires organizations optimize the efficacy of their defenses (“shields”), 
including context\-sensitive technologies that can elevate the level of protection 
in proportion to the situation. Crucially, they also need to use the time that their 
defenses buy them to apply human expertise to address the root cause. requires 

The quality of your cybersecurity technologies is paramount, and security controls 
should:

 Ì Optimize prevention, automatically detecting and stopping as many threats 
as possible early in the attack chain. In doing so, you reduce the risk to the 
organization while freeing up defenders to focus on fewer incidents.

 Ì Reduce exposure by making it easy to ensure security investments are 
correctly and optimally deployed and avoid misconfiguration issues.

 Ì Disrupt adversaries. Technologies that automatically detect and disrupt 
adversarial activity frustrate attackers while buying defenders time to 
neutralize the incident.

Address The Root Cause with People and Technology 

Shields buy defenders valuable time to investigate and respond to attacks. They 
don’t guarantee 100% prevention, however, which is why timely, well\-informed, and 
well\-executed root cause remediation is essential. 

As the research has shown, adversaries do not follow a single path. Leveraging 
telemetry from across the security environment, using the security controls 
organizations already have, enables defenders to see and respond to threats faster 
while increasing return on existing investments. 

Finding malicious activity among the benign alerts is often akin to hunting for the 
needle in the haystack, or even in a pile of needles. Processing the signals through 
an Extended Detection and Response (XDR) platform that adds contextual insights 
and correlates related alerts enables in\-house defenders to quickly focus on what’s 
important. Investigation and response can be performed via an XDR platform 
by the in\-house team. Alternatively, organizations can outsource the detection, 
investigation, and response work to a specialist Managed Detection and Response 
(MDR) service.

Accelerating the Defender Flywheel

Once a flywheel starts spinning at high speed, it wants to keep spinning. The 
more force behind a flywheel, the faster it goes. Organizations can accelerate 
their cybersecurity flywheel by combining security technologies and human 
expertise. Comprehensive security controls reduce the volume of alerts that 
defenders need to deal with, enabling them to focus on neutralizing attacks 
and elevating their security posture. In turn, this increases the efficacy of their 
security controls, creating a virtuous circle. 

Most Organizations Plan to Adopt 
the Security Controls and Services Needed

The survey revealed that most organizations plan to add threat detection and 
response solutions to their security stack within the next 12 months. Over three 
quarters (78%) plan to add Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and/or 
Extended Detection and Response (XDR) tools in the coming year.

Investigating and responding to advanced cyberthreats is a specialist skill and 
providing 24/7 coverage requires a minimum of five or six people. With a shortage 
of in\-house cybersecurity skills/expertise listed as one of the top three perceived 
cyber risks for 2023, many organizations are looking to external experts for 
support: 44% of organizations plan to start working with a Managed Detection 
and Response (MDR) provider within the next 12 months.

Sophos Can Help

Optimize Detection, Investigation and Response

Sophos provides the services and technologies that enable organizations to 
accelerate the defender flywheel and move ahead of adversaries. We defend over 
550,000 organizations against the most advanced threats, and Sophos MDR is the 
world’s most trusted MDR service.

The more defenders see, the faster they can act. At Sophos we use detections 
from across the security environment, integrating telemetry from both Sophos 
and third\-party security controls to accelerate detection and response, and 
increase return on existing security investments.

Start with the Strongest Shields

Our endpoint/EDR, firewall, email, network, and cloud solutions slow down 
attackers and give defenders the time and insights they need to respond:

 Ì Optimize prevention: Sophos blocks 99\.98% of threats automatically 

out of the gate, minimizing risk and enabling defenders to focus 
on fewer incidents that require human intervention.

 Ì Reduce exposure: Optimal protection settings are deployed automatically from 
day one, eliminating security gaps. Built\-in Account Health Checks highlight 
missing software and configuration issues that can lead to avoidable infections.

 Ì Disrupt adversaries. Adaptive Active Adversary Protection immediately 

activates heightened defenses when a “hands\-on\-keyboard” endpoint intrusion 
is detected, frustrating attackers and buying defenders time to respond. 

The Sophos MDR service brings together over 500 experts to hunt for, investigate 
and respond to active adversaries and other attacks on your behalf 24/7/365\. 
With an average threat response time of just 38 minutes, Sophos MDR is 
considerably faster than the in\-house team average. Alternatively, organizations 
can use the Sophos XDR platform that includes full EDR functionality to 
investigate and respond to attacks directly or work in collaboration with the 
Sophos MDR team.

Wherever your organization is today, and where it wants to be in the future, 
Sophos can help you accelerate your defender flywheel and move ahead of 
today’s advanced adversaries. For more information, visit www.sophos.com or
