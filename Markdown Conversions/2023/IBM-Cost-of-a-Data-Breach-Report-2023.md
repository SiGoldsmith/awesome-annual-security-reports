Executive summary

The Cost of a Data Breach Report equips IT, 
risk management and security leaders with 
quantifiable evidence to help them better manage 
their security investments, risk profile and strategic 
decision\-making processes. The 2023 edition 
represents this report’s 18th consecutive year. 

This year’s research—conducted independently 
by Ponemon Institute and sponsored, analyzed 
and published by IBM Security®—studied 553 
organizations impacted by data breaches that 
occurred between March 2022 and March 2023\. 

The years mentioned in this report refer 
to the year the report was published, 
not necessarily the year of the breach. 
The breaches studied took place across 
16 countries and regions and in 17 
different industries. 

Throughout this report, we’ll examine the 
root causes and both short\-term and long\-
term consequences of data breaches. We’ll 
also explore the factors and technologies 
that enabled companies to limit losses—as 
well as those that led to increased costs.

Executive summary

What’s new in the 2023 report

Each year, we continue to evolve the 
Cost of a Data Breach Report to match 
new technologies, emerging tactics 
and recent events. For the first time, 
this year’s research explores:

 – How breaches are identified: whether 

by an organization’s own security teams, 
another third party or the attacker

 – The impact of involving law enforcement 

in a ransomware attack

 – The effect of ransomware playbooks 

and workflows 

As the cost of a breach continues to 
increase, this report delivers essential 
insights to help security and IT teams 
better manage risk and limit potential 
losses. The report is divided into five 
major sections:

 – Specific costs associated with 

 – The executive summary with key findings 

regulatory fines

 – If and how companies plan to increase 

security investment as a result of 
a breach

 – The impact of the following mitigation 

strategies: 
• Threat intelligence
• Vulnerability and risk management
• Attack surface management (ASM)
• Managed security service providers 

(MSSPs)

and what’s new in the 2023 edition

USD 4\.45M

Average total cost of a breach 
The average cost of a data breach reached an all\-time high in 2023 
of USD 4\.45 million. This represents a 2\.3% increase from the 2022 
cost of USD 4\.35 million. Taking a long\-term view, the average cost has 
increased 15\.3% from USD 3\.86 million in the 2020 report.

Key findings

The key findings described here are based 
on IBM Security analysis of research data 
compiled by Ponemon Institute. Cost 
amounts in this report are measured in 
US dollars (USD).

USD 1\.76M

Percentage of organizations planning to increase 
security investments as a result of a breach 
While data breach costs continued to rise, report participants 
were almost equally split on whether they plan to increase security 
investments because of a data breach. The top areas identified 
for additional investments included incident response (IR) 
planning and testing, employee training, and threat detection 
and response technologies.

The effect of extensive security AI and automation 
on the financial impact of a breach 
Security AI and automation were shown to be important investments 
for reducing costs and minimizing time to identify and contain 
breaches. Organizations that used these capabilities extensively within 
their approach experienced, on average, a 108\-day shorter time to 
identify and contain the breach. They also reported USD 1\.76 million 
lower data breach costs compared to organizations that didn’t use 
security AI and automation capabilities.

Number of breaches identified by an 
organization’s own security teams or tools 
Only one\-third of companies discovered 
the data breach through their own security 
teams, highlighting a need for better 
threat detection. 67% of breaches were 
reported by a benign third party or by the 
attackers themselves. When attackers 
disclosed a breach, it cost organizations 
nearly USD 1 million more compared to 
internal detection.

Additional cost experienced by 
organizations that didn’t involve law 
enforcement in a ransomware attack
This year’s research shows that excluding 
law enforcement from ransomware 
incidents led to higher costs. While 63% 
of respondents said they involved law 
enforcement, the 37% that didn’t also 
paid 9\.6% more and experienced a 33\-day 
longer breach lifecycle.

Since 2020, healthcare data breach costs 
have increased 53\.3%
The highly regulated healthcare industry 
has seen a considerable rise in data breach 
costs since 2020\. For the 13th year in 
a row, the healthcare industry reported 
the most expensive data breaches, at an 
average cost of USD 10\.93 million. 

The percentage of breaches that involved 
data stored in the cloud—public, private or 
multiple environments 
Cloud environments were frequent targets 
for cyberattackers in 2023\. Attackers often 
gained access to multiple environments, 
with 39% of breaches spanning multiple 
environments and incurring a higher\-than\-
average cost of USD 4\.75 million.

Cost savings from high levels of 
DevSecOps adoption 
Integrated security testing in the software 
development process (DevSecOps) showed 
sizable ROI in 2023\. Organizations with 
high DevSecOps adoption saved USD 
1\.68 million compared to those with 
low or no adoption. Compared to other 
cost\-mitigating factors, DevSecOps 
demonstrated the largest cost savings.

Cost savings achieved by organizations 
with high levels of IR planning and testing 
In addition to being a priority investment 
for organizations, IR planning and testing 
emerged as a highly effective tactic for 
containing the cost of a data breach. 
Organizations with high levels of IR 
planning and testing saved USD 1\.49 
million compared to those with low levels.

Increase in data breach costs for 
organizations that had high levels of 
security system complexity 
Organizations that reported low or no 
security system complexity experienced 
an average data breach cost of USD 3\.84 
million in 2023\. Those with high levels 
of security system complexity reported 
an average cost of USD 5\.28 million, 
representing an increase of 31\.6%. 

Average cost difference between 
breaches that took more than 200 days 
to find and resolve, and those that took 
less than 200 days
Time to identify and contain breaches—
known as the breach lifecycle—continues 
to be integral to the overall financial 
impact. Breaches with identification and 
containment times under 200 days cost 
organizations USD 3\.93 million. Those 
over 200 days cost USD 4\.95 million—a 
difference of 23%.

Global highlights

The Cost of a Data Breach Report 
provides a global picture of the cost of 
data breaches, built using data from over 
553 breaches in 16 different countries 
and taking into account hundreds of cost 
factors. This section examines critical 
metrics at the level of global average. 
We also explore the average per\-record 
comparative costs between countries 
and industries.

Complete findings

Figure 1\. The cost of a data breach 
climbed to a new high.
Globally, the average cost of a data breach 
rose to USD 4\.45 million, a USD 100,000 
increase from 2022\. This represents a 
2\.3% increase from the 2022 average cost 
of USD 4\.35 million. Since 2020, when the 
average total cost of a data breach was 
USD 3\.86 million, the average total cost has 
increased 15\.3%.

Figure 2\. Per\-record cost of a data breach 
also reached a new high.
In 2023, the average cost per record 
involved in a data breach was USD 165, a 
small increase from the 2022 average of 
USD 164\. This matches the relatively small 
growth from 2021 to 2022, where the cost 
rose by just USD 3\. In the last seven years, 
the largest increase in average per\-record 
costs was between 2020 and 2021, when 
the average rose from USD 146 to USD 161 
or 10\.3%. This study examined breaches 
sized between 2,200 and 102,000 records.1

Of this year’s top five, Japan is the only 
country that didn’t appear on the 2022 top 
five list, moving up from the number 6 most 
expensive spot last year. The top 5 list last 
year also included the United Kingdom (UK) 
at an average data breach cost of USD 5\.05 
million. This year, the UK saw a significant 
drop in average cost at USD 4\.21 million—
down 16\.6% from last year—resulting in 
placement just outside of the top five.

The United States again had the highest 
average total cost of a data breach at USD 
9\.48 million, an increase of 0\.4% from 
last year’s USD 9\.44 million. Like last year, 
the Middle East had the second\-highest 
average total cost of a data breach at 
USD 8\.07 million, up 8\.2% from USD 
7\.46 million. 

In Canada, the average total cost of a data 
breach decreased from USD 5\.64 million 
to USD 5\.13 million or 9%. The average 
cost also decreased in Germany, dropping 
from USD 4\.85 million to USD 4\.67 million 
or 3\.7%. Japan saw the average drop 
slightly, from USD 4\.57 million to USD 4\.52 
million or 1\.1%.

Cost of a data breach by industry

Figure 4\. Across industries, healthcare 
reported the highest costs for the 13th 
year in a row.
Healthcare continues to experience the 
highest data breach costs of all industries, 
increasing from USD 10\.10 million in 2022 
to USD 10\.93 million in 2023—an increase 
of 8\.2%. Over the past three years, the 
average cost of a data breach in healthcare 
has grown 53\.3%, increasing more than 
USD 3 million compared to the average cost 
of USD 7\.13 million in 2020\. Healthcare 
faces high levels of industry regulation 
and is considered critical infrastructure by 
the US government. Since the start of the 
COVID\-19 pandemic, the industry has seen 
notably higher average data breach costs. 

The top five most costly industries 
underwent some changes from last year’s 
rankings. Technology dropped out of the 

top five while the industrial sector was 
added, showing a 5\.8% increase as it 
moved from the seventh\-highest to the 
fifth. According to IBM threat intelligence, 
manufacturing is the industry most 
commonly targeted by cybercriminals.

Figure 5\. Mean times to identify 
and contain breaches stayed roughly 
the same. 
Compared to 2022, both the mean time 
to identify (MTTI) and the mean time to 
contain (MTTC) breaches saw only marginal 
changes. Mean time to identify refers to 
the time it takes an organization to uncover 
a security breach. Mean time to contain 
refers to the time required to resolve a 
security breach once it has been identified.

In 2022, it took organizations 207 days 
to identify a breach. In 2023, it took only 
204 days. On the other hand, organizations 
required an average of 73 days to contain 
breaches in 2023, while they required 
just 70 days on average in 2022\. The 
highest mean times to contain and identify 
breaches both occurred in 2021, at 212 
and 75 days, respectively.

Figure 6\. Lost business costs hit a 
five\-year low.
Last year’s report saw detection and 
escalation costs rise to become the 
costliest category of data breach expenses, 
indicating a shift toward longer and more\-
complex breach investigations. The trend 
continued this year as detection and 
escalation costs remained in the top spot 
and rose from USD 1\.44 million to USD 1\.58 
million, demonstrating a change of USD 
140,000 or 9\.7%. Detection and escalation 
costs include activities that enable a 
company to reasonably detect a breach 
and can include forensic and investigative 
activities, assessment and audit services, 
crisis management, and communications 
to executives and boards. 

The other key cost segments of a data 
breach—lost business cost, post\-breach 
response and notification—also saw 
changes compared to 2022\. Lost business 
costs dropped 8\.5%, from USD 1\.42 
million in 2022 to USD 1\.30 million in 
2023\. Lost business costs include activities 
such as business disruptions and revenue 
losses from system downtime, the cost 
of lost customers and acquiring new 
customers, and reputation losses and 
diminished goodwill.

Notably, the notification cost segment rose 
from USD 310,000 in 2022 to USD 370,000 
in 2023, which represents a 19\.4% 
increase. Post\-breach response costs rose 
by just USD 20,000\. Notification costs 
include activities that enable the company 
to notify data subjects, data protection 
regulators and other third parties.

Figure 7\. Smaller organizations faced 
considerably higher data breach costs 
than last year.
In 2023, organizations with more than 
5,000 employees saw the average cost 
of a data breach decrease compared to 
2022\. On the other hand, those with 
5,000 or fewer employees saw 
considerable increases in the average 
cost of a data breach.

Organizations with fewer than 500 
employees reported that the average 
impact of a data breach increased from 
USD 2\.92 million to USD 3\.31 million or 
13\.4%. Those with 500–1,000 employees 

saw an increase of 21\.4%, from USD 2\.71 
million to USD 3\.29 million. In the 1,001–
5,000 employee range, the average cost of a 
data breach increased from USD 4\.06 million 
to USD 4\.87 million, rising nearly 20%. 

In the 10,001–25,000 range, respondents 
reported an average cost of USD 5\.46 
million, a decrease of 1\.8% from 2022’s 
figure of USD 5\.56 million. Organizations 
with more than 25,000 employees saw the 
average cost drop from USD 5\.56 million 
in 2022 to USD 5\.42 million in 2023, a 
decrease of USD 140,000 or 2\.5%.

Type of data compromised

Figures 9a and 9b. Customer PII was 
the costliest—and most common—record 
compromised.
Of all record types, customer and employee 
personal identifiable information (PII) 
was the costliest to have compromised. 
In 2023, customer PII such as names and 
Social Security numbers cost organizations 
USD 183 per record, with employee PII 
close behind at USD 181 per record. 
The least expensive record type to have 
compromised is anonymized customer 
data, which cost organizations USD 138 per 
record in 2023\.

As was the case in 2022 and 2021, 
customer PII was the most commonly 
breached record type in 2023\. 52% 
of all breaches involved some form of 

customer PII. This is an increase of five 
percentage points from 2022, when 
customer PII accounted for 47% of all data 
compromised. The second\-most commonly 
compromised data type was employee 
PII at 40%. Compromised employee PII 
has seen sizable growth from 2021, 
when it only accounted for 26% of all 
records compromised. 

Compromised intellectual property grew 
three percentage points since 2022, while 
anonymized (non\-PII) data dropped seven 
percentage points from 2022—decreasing 
from 33% to 26%. Other corporate 
data, such as financial information and 
client lists, increased from 15% of data 
compromised in 2022 to 21% in 2023\.

Initial attack vectors

This section examines the initial attack 
vector identified for data breaches in 
the study and its impact on the breach 
cost and timeline. It identifies the most 
common root causes for data breaches in 
the report and compares the average cost 
of breaches for each category as well as 
the average time to identify and contain 
those breaches. Phishing and stolen or 
compromised credentials were the two 
most prevalent attack vectors in this year’s 
report, and both also ranked among the top 
four costliest incident types.

of USD 4\.90 million, which is 9\.6% higher 
than the global average cost of USD 4\.45 
million per data breach. Phishing was 
the most prevalent attack vector and 
the second most expensive at USD 4\.76 
million. Breaches attributed to system error 
were the least costly, at an average of USD 
3\.96 million, and the least common, at 5% 
of occurrences.

Figure 10\. Phishing and stolen or 
compromised credentials were the two 
most common initial attack vectors. 
Phishing and stolen or compromised 
credentials were responsible for 16% 
and 15% of breaches, respectively, with 
phishing moving into the lead spot by 
a small margin over stolen credentials, 
which was the most common vector in 
the 2022 report. Cloud misconfiguration 
was identified as the initial vector for 11% 
of attacks, followed by business email 
compromise at 9%. This year, for the first 
time, the report examined both zero\-day 
(unknown) vulnerabilities as well as known, 
unpatched vulnerabilities as the source 
of the data breach and found that more 
than 5% of the breaches studied originated 
from known vulnerabilities that had yet 
to be patched.

Time to identify and contain a data breach by initial attack vector

Figure 11\. Breaches that initiated with 
stolen or compromised credentials 
and malicious insiders took the longest 
to resolve. 
This year, it took nearly 11 months (328 
days) to identify and contain data breaches 
resulting from stolen or compromised 
credentials, on average, and about 10 
months (308 days) to resolve breaches 
that were initiated by a malicious insider. 
Those two vectors, along with phishing 
and business email compromise, were also 
responsible for the costliest breaches. 

As a point of comparison, the overall mean 
time to identify and contain a data breach 
was 277 days or just over nine months. 
That figure has remained relatively constant 
over the past few years of the report.

Identifying attacks 

This section looks at how breaches 
were identified and the differences in 
cost and containment time based on 
the identification method, analyses that 
are reported for the first time this year. 
There are three categories that define 
how breaches are identified: by an 
organization’s internal security teams and 
tools, including managed security service 
providers (MSSPs); by a benign third 
party, such as a security researcher or law 
enforcement; and by disclosure from the 
attacker, as in the case of ransomware.

Figure 12\. Breaches were most commonly 
identified by a benign third party.
40% of breaches were identified by a 
benign third party or outsider, whereas 
33% of breaches were identified by internal 
teams and tools. Over one\-quarter or 27% 
of breaches were disclosed by the attacker 
as part of a ransomware attack. 

Figure 13\. Data breaches disclosed by the 
attacker, such as with ransomware, cost 
significantly more.
Attacks disclosed by attackers had an 
average cost of USD 5\.23 million, which 
was a 19\.5% or USD 930,000 difference 
over the average cost of breaches identified 
through internal security teams or tools of 
USD 4\.30 million. Additionally, breaches 
disclosed by attackers cost 16\.1% or USD 
780,000 more than the USD 4\.45 million 
average cost of a data breach for 2023\. 
Breaches identified by an organization’s 
own security teams and tools were 
significantly less expensive, costing nearly 
USD 1 million less than incidents disclosed 
by the attacker.

Data breach lifecycle

The data breach lifecycle is defined as the 
elapsed time between the initial detection 
of the breach and its containment. “Time 
to identify” describes the time, in days, 
it takes to discover an incident. “Time 
to contain” refers to the time, in days, 
it takes for an organization to resolve 
the situation and restore service after 
the breach has been detected. These 
two metrics help determine the 
effectiveness of an organization’s 
IR and containment processes.

Figure 15\. A shorter data breach lifecycle 
continues to be associated with lower 
data breach costs.
A shorter data breach lifecycle of fewer 
than 200 days was associated with an 
average cost of USD 3\.93 million, while a 
longer lifecycle of more than 200 days was 
associated with an average cost of USD 
4\.95 million. This reflects a 23% difference 
and a cost savings of USD 1\.02 million for 
the shorter lifecycle.

Looking back at previous years, the average 
cost of a data breach based on the 200\-
day lifecycle has been relatively consistent, 
although it changed incrementally. 

For a data breach lifecycle of fewer than 
200 days, the 2023 value of USD 3\.93 
million grew 5\.1% from the previous year’s 
average cost of USD 3\.74 million. For a data 
breach lifecycle of more than 200 days, the 
2023 value of USD 4\.95 million grew 1\.9% 
from the previous year’s average cost of 
USD 4\.86 million. The average cost savings 
of USD 1\.02 million reported in 2023 
reflects an 8\.9% decrease from 2022’s 
cost savings of USD 1\.12 million.

Key cost factors

The types of security technologies and 
practices employed within an organization 
are among many factors that influence the 
mean cost of a data breach. This section 
quantifies 27 cost factors to help security 
and risk decision\-makers understand the 
degree to which these factors amplify 
or mitigate costs. These factors aren’t 
additive, so it’s not consistent with the 
research methodology to add multiple cost 
factors together to calculate the potential 
cost of a breach.

This year, the Cost of a Data Breach Report 
considers several new factors, including 
supply chain breaches, ASM tools, data 
security and protection software, endpoint 
detection and response (EDR) tools, threat 
intelligence, proactive threat hunting, 
IR teams, and security orchestration, 
automation and response (SOAR) tools.

Complete findings

249,000 less than the 2023 mean cost 
of a data breach of USD 4\.45 million or 
approximately USD 4\.20 million. 

The biggest cost amplifiers were security 
system complexity, security skills shortage, 
and noncompliance with regulations. For 
example, breaches at organizations with 
security system complexity had an average 
cost of USD 241,000 more than the 2023 
mean cost of a data breach of USD 4\.45 
million or approximately USD 4\.69 million. 

Figure 16\. The impact of 27 factors on the 
mean cost of a data breach. 
The chart demonstrates the average cost 
difference of breaches at organizations with 
these cost\-influencing factors compared 
to the overall average data breach cost of 
USD 4\.45 million. Cost mitigators describe 
those factors that are associated with a 
lower\-than\-average breach cost, while cost 
amplifiers are associated with a higher\-
than\-average breach cost.

The three factors that rank most effective 
as cost mitigators—those associated 
with the biggest cost reduction—are 
the adoption of a DevSecOps approach, 
employee training, and IR planning 
and testing. For example, breaches at 
organizations with a DevSecOps approach 
in place had an average cost that was USD

This chart compares organizations 
with the highest levels of a top\-ranking

level, which in some cases could mean 
no instance of that same factor. This 
comparison differs from the prior analysis 
(Figure 16\) in which a high presence of 
these factors is compared to the mean. 
There was a difference of USD 1\.58 million 
or 34\.6% between high levels and low 
levels of secrity skills shortage. A difference 
of USD 1\.44 million or 31\.6% occurred 
between high levels and low levels of 
security system complexity. And there 
was a difference of USD 1\.04 million or 
23% between high levels and low levels 
of noncompliance with regulations. 

Organizations with a high level of security 
skills shortage had a USD 5\.36 million 
average cost, which was USD 910,000 
higher than the average cost of a data 
breach, a difference of 18\.6%. Those with 
a high level of security system complexity 
had a USD 5\.28 million average cost, for 
a difference of USD 830,000 or 17\.1% 
compared to the average cost of a data

Among organizations that experienced

ransomware attacks were able to contain 
them in 68 days or 16% fewer days 
compared to the average of 80 days for 
organizations without automated response 
playbooks or workflows. 

Figure 25\. Paying the ransom led to 
minimal cost savings.
Organizations that paid the ransom during 
a ransomware attack achieved only a 
small difference in total cost, at USD 5\.06 
million compared to USD 5\.17 million, a 
cost difference of USD 110,000 or 2\.2%. 
However, this calculation doesn’t include 
the cost of the ransom itself. Given the 
high cost of most ransomware demands, 
organizations that paid the ransom likely 
ended up spending more overall than 
those that didn’t pay the ransom. In the 
2022 report, the total cost savings were 
USD 630,000, with a total cost difference 
of 13\.1%, again not including the cost of 
the ransom itself. The data shows that 
paying a ransom has become increasingly 
less advantageous overall, with an 82\.5% 
decrease in savings from the 2022 to

Business partner supply 
chain attacks

A business partner supply chain 
compromise is a data breach that originates 
with an attack on a business partner. In 
this year’s study, 15% of organizations 
identified a supply chain compromise as 
the source of a data breach. 

Figures 26 and 27\. A business partner 
supply chain compromise cost 11\.8% 
more and took 12\.8% longer to identify 
and contain than other breach types.
The cost of a data breach due to a business 
partner supply chain compromise averaged 
USD 4\.76 million, which was USD 530,000 
or 11\.8% higher than the USD 4\.23 million 
average cost of a data breach that was due 
to another cause. 

Organizations took an average of 233 
days to identify and 74 days to contain a 
business partner supply chain compromise, 
for a total lifecycle of 307 days. That 
average lifecycle was 37 days or 12\.8% 
longer than the average lifecycle of 270 
days for data breaches attributed to 
another cause.

Software supply chain attacks

For the first time this year, the study also 
examined attacks that originated from a 
software supply chain attack in which an 
attacker infiltrates a software vendor’s 
network and deploys malicious code 
to compromise the software before the 
vendor sends it to its customers. The 
compromised software then attacks the 
customer’s data or system. In this year’s 
study, 12% of organizations identified a 
software supply chain attack as the source 
of a data breach.

Regulatory environments 

The research examined how the degree of 
data regulation affected the cost of a data 
breach. In environments with high levels of 
data regulation, 58% of costs continued to 
accrue after the first year. In low\-regulation 
environments, 64% of the costs associated 
with a breach were more likely to be 
resolved within the first year.

The cost of a data breach tends to change 
in the time elapsed since the breach. There 
may be different costs associated with each 
stage of the breach as it’s identified and 
contained and as the compromised data is 
recovered or repaired.

Cloud breaches

The cost and duration of a breach varied 
depending on where the data was stored. 
Most commonly, the breaches studied 
included data that spanned multiple 
environments—including cloud and on 
premises—and breaches of this type also 
contributed to higher costs and longer time 
to identify and contain a data breach.

Mega breaches

Mega breaches, characterized by more 
than one million compromised records, are 
relatively rare. But they exert a powerful 
impact due to their outsized scope. 

This year’s study included 20 organizations 
that endured the loss or theft of between 
1 million and 60 million records due to data 
breaches. The study deployed a distinct 
methodology to examine those mega 
breaches. They were considered separately 
from the study’s other 553 breaches, 
each including no more than 101,200 
lost or compromised records. For a full 
explanation of the research methodology,

Security AI and automation

With security AI and automation use 
cases for the security industry advancing, 
this report examines the impact of these 
technologies on data breach costs and 
timelines. Examples include the use of 
AI, machine learning, automation and 
orchestration to augment or replace human 
intervention in detection and investigation 
of threats as well as the response and 
containment process. On the opposite 
end of the spectrum are processes driven 
by manual inputs, often across dozens of 
tools and complex, nonintegrated systems, 
without data shared between them.

Though this is the sixth year of investigating 
the impact of AI and automation on 
cybersecurity, this year we’re introducing 
new criteria that considered AI’s permeation 
throughout an organization’s security 

processes as opposed to its level of 
deployment—ranging from not deployed 
to partially or fully deployed—in prior 
years’ data. 

 – “Extensive use” refers to the integration 

of security AI and automation throughout 
operations, including several different 
tool sets and capabilities.

 – “Limited use” refers to applying AI 
to just one or two use cases within 
security operations.

 – “No use” refers to security processes 

that are driven solely by manual inputs.

108 days

Organizations with extensive use of security AI 
and automation identified and contained a data 
breach 108 days faster than organizations 
with no use.

Figure 41\. Extensive security AI and 
automation use delivered cost savings 
of nearly USD 1\.8 million. 
Organizations with extensive use of security

highest cost savings comparatively, with 
an average cost of a data breach at USD 
3\.60 million, which was USD 1\.76 million 
less and a 39\.3% difference compared to 
no use. Even organizations with limited use 
of security AI and automation measured 
an average cost of a data breach of USD 
4\.04 million, which was USD 1\.32 million 
less or a 28\.1% difference compared to no 
use. However, organizations with no use of 
security AI and automation experienced 
an average cost of a data breach of USD 
5\.36 million. This is 18\.6% more than the 
2023 average cost of a data breach of 
USD 4\.45 million.

Respondents from organizations 
that extensively used security AI and 
automation were able to identify and 
contain a breach in 214 days, which was 
108 days shorter than those with no use. 
This means identifying and containing a 
breach with extensive use of security AI 
and automation took just 66% of the time 

it took organizations with no use. Limited 
use also made a significant impact, with 
an average time to identify and contain a 
breach in 234 days, which was 88 days 
shorter than organizations with no use. 
It’s clear that even a limited effort to 
integrate security AI and automation into 
security workflows can offer a significant 
acceleration in the time to identify and 
contain a breach as well as a sizable 
reduction in costs.

Incident response

IR strategies and tactics have been 
instrumental in reducing the impact of data 
breaches. The most effective IR strategy 
for reducing the duration of a data breach 
was to combine formation of an IR team 
with testing of the IR plan. However, some 
organizations pursued only one of those 
two strategies. As a standalone effort, IR 
plan testing was more effective than only 
forming an IR team in reducing the total 
time to identify and contain the breach.

New this year, the research examined 
how organizations prioritized risks and 
vulnerabilities and how this impacted the 
cost of a data breach. Organizations with 
more proactive and risk\-based vulnerability 
management, such as vulnerability 
testing, penetration testing or red teaming, 
experienced lower than average data 
breach costs compared to organizations 
that relied solely on the industry standard 
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures 
(CVE) glossary and the Common 
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). 
Generally, proactive risk management 
efforts involve the organization’s IT 
security team adopting the perspective of 
a potential attacker to determine which 
vulnerabilities are exploitable and can 
cause the most harm.

Attack surface management

ASM is a set of processes that aids in 
the discovery, analysis, remediation and 
monitoring of an organization’s potential 
attack surfaces or vulnerabilities. 
Organizations that deployed an ASM 
solution were able to identify and contain 
data breaches in 75% of the time of those 
without an ASM solution.

Figure 47\. ASM helped accelerate total 
time to identify and contain a data breach 
by nearly 12 weeks.
Without an ASM solution, organizations 
took 260 days to identify a data breach 
and another 77 days to contain it, for a 
total of 337 days or about 11 months. 
Organizations with an ASM solution 
identified the breach in 193 days and 
contained it in 61 days. The 254\-day total 
time to identify and contain a breach 
represented an acceleration of 83 days or 
about 12 weeks so the data breaches were 
identified and contained in 75% of the time 
taken by data breaches at organizations 
without ASM solutions.

Managed security 
service providers

For the first time, our research explored 
the impact that partnering with an MSSP 
had on the time to identify and contain 
a breach. MSSPs offer organizations the 
ability to outsource security monitoring and 
management, often using high\-availability 
security operations centers to provide 
around\-the\-clock services. MSSPs can 
help organizations enhance their security 
posture without increasing head count or 
investing in training for internal resources.

Figure 48\. Organizations with 
MSSPs experienced a 21% shorter 
breach lifecycle.
In the 2023 report, organizations that had 
an MSSP were able to identify and contain 
breaches in 80% of the time of those 
without. Organizations that worked with 
an MSSP identified breaches 16 days faster 
or an 8\.2% shorter identification time than 
the 2023 reported global average of 204 
days. Those that didn’t took 28 days longer 
or 12\.8% longer. Containment times with 
no MSSP were five days longer or 6\.6%

Build security into every stage of software 
development and deployment—and 
test regularly
Regulatory requirements continue to 
become more intricate, especially as 
technology becomes more intertwined 
with everyday activities and software 
becomes more feature rich and complex. 
A DevSecOps approach—the top cost 
mitigator in a special analysis of 27 factors 
in the 2023 report—will be essential to 
building security into any tools or platforms 
an organization depends on to engage its 
workforce or its customers. 

Organizations of all types should look to 
ensure that security is at the forefront of 
the software they’re developing as well 
as commercial off\-the\-shelf software that 
they’re deploying. Application developers 
must continue to accelerate the adoption 
of the principles of secure by design and 
secure by default to ensure that security 
is a core requirement that’s considered 
during the initial design phase of digital 
transformation projects and not simply 
addressed after the fact. The same 
principles are being applied to cloud 
environments to support cloud\-native app 
development that makes a serious effort to 
protect user privacy and minimize attack 
surfaces. 

Application testing or penetration testing 
from the perspective of an attacker can 
also give organizations the opportunity to 
identify and patch vulnerabilities before 
they turn into breaches. No technology 
or application will ever be fully secure, 
and adding more features introduces new 
risks. Ongoing application testing can help 
organizations identify new vulnerabilities.

Modernize data protection across 
hybrid cloud 
Data is being created, shared and accessed 
at unprecedented scale across multicloud 
environments. Fast\-paced adoption of 
new cloud applications and services 
is compounding the risk of “shadow 
data”—sensitive data not being tracked 
or managed—increasing security and 
compliance risks. The majority (82%) of 
data breaches in this report involved data 
stored in cloud environments, and 39% 
of breaches included data that spanned 
multiple types of environments. The 
cost and risk of these data breaches are 
compounded by an ever\-evolving matrix 
of regulations and stiff penalties for 
noncompliance.

In the wake of these challenges, gaining 
visibility and control of data spread across 
hybrid cloud should be a top priority for 
organizations of all types and should 
include a focus on strong encryption, 
data security and data access policies. 
Companies should seek data security and 
compliance technologies that work on all 
platforms, allowing them to protect data 
as it moves across databases, applications 
and services deployed across hybrid cloud 
environments. Data activity–monitoring 
solutions can help ensure proper controls 
are in place while actively enforcing 
these policies—such as early detection of 
suspicious activity and blocking real\-time 
threats to critical data stores. 

Additionally, newer technologies such as 
data security posture management can 
help find unknown and sensitive data 
across the cloud, including structured 
and unstructured assets within cloud 
service providers, software as a service 
(SaaS) properties and data lakes. This can 
help identify and mitigate vulnerabilities 
in underlying data store configurations, 
entitlements and data flows. 

As organizations continue to move further 
into hybrid multicloud operations, it’s 
essential to deploy strong identity and 
access management (IAM) strategies that 
include technologies such as multifactor 
authentication (MFA), with particular focus 
on managing privileged user accounts that 
have an elevated access level.

Use security AI and automation to 
increase speed and accuracy 
In the 2023 report, only 28% of 
organizations used security AI and 
automation extensively in their operations, 
which means many organizations have a 
significant opportunity to improve their 
speed, accuracy and efficiency. Extensive 
use of security AI and automation delivered 
nearly USD 1\.8 million in data breach 
cost savings and accelerated the time to 
identify and contain a breach by more 
than 100 days compared to organizations 
with no use. 

Security teams can benefit from having 
security AI and automation embedded 
throughout their tool sets. For example, 

using security AI and automation across 
threat detection and response tools can 
help analysts detect new threats more 
accurately and contextualize and triage 
security alerts more effectively. These 
technologies can also automate portions 
of the threat investigation process or 
recommend actions to speed response. 
Additionally, AI\-driven data security and 
identity solutions can help drive a proactive 
security posture by identifying high\-
risk transactions, protecting them with 
minimal user friction and stitching together 
suspicious behaviors more effectively.

When applying AI within your security 
operations, look for technologies that 
offer trusted and mature use cases with 
demonstrated accuracy, effectiveness and 
transparency to eliminate potential bias, 
blind spots or drift. Organizations should 
plan an operational model for AI adoption 
that supports continuous learning as 
threats and technology capabilities evolve. 

Organizations can also benefit from an 
approach that tightly integrates core 
security technologies for smoother 
workflows and the ability to share 
insights across common data pools. Chief 
information security officers (CISOs) and 
security operations (SecOps) leaders can 
also use threat intelligence reports to help 
with pattern recognition and threat visibility 
for emerging threats.

Recommendations to help reduce 
the cost of a data breach

03

4

Strengthen resiliency by knowing 
your attack surface and practicing IR
Understand your exposure to the attacks 
most relevant to your industry and 
organization, and prioritize your security 
strategy accordingly. Tools such as ASM or 
techniques such as adversary simulation 
can help organizations gain an attacker\-
informed perspective into their unique risk 
profile and vulnerabilities, including which 
vulnerabilities are readily exploitable.

Additionally, having a team in place that’s 
already versed in the right protocols and 
tools to respond to an incident has been 
shown to significantly reduce costs and 
the time to identify and contain the breach. 

Not only was IR planning and testing 
a top 3 cost mitigator in the 2023 
report, but the data also showed that 
organizations with high levels of these 
countermeasures in place incurred USD 
1\.49 million lower data breach costs 
compared to organizations with low levels 
or none, and they resolved incidents 54 
days faster. Form a dedicated IR team, 
draft IR playbooks and regularly test IR 
plans in tabletop exercises or simulated 
environments such as a cyber range. 
Having an IR vendor on retainer can also 
help speed the time to respond to a breach.

Lastly, organizations should look to 
implement network segmentation 
practices to limit the spread of attacks 
and the extent of damage they can cause, 
strengthening overall resiliency and 
reducing recovery efforts.

Recommendations for security practices 
are for educational purposes and don’t 
guarantee results.

Research methodology

To preserve confidentiality, the benchmark 
instrument didn’t capture any company\-specific 
information. Data collection methods excluded 
actual accounting information and instead relied 
on participants estimating direct costs by marking 
a range variable on a number line. Participants 
were instructed to mark the number line in one 
spot between the lower and upper limits of a range 
for each cost category.

We limited the scope of data breach cost 
factors to known categories that apply to a 
broad set of business operations involving 
personal information. We chose to focus 
on business processes instead of data 
protection or privacy compliance activities 
because we believed the process study 
would yield better\-quality results.

The numerical value obtained from the 
number line, rather than a point estimate 
for each presented cost category, 
preserved confidentiality and ensured 
a higher response rate. The benchmark 
instrument also required respondents to 
provide a second separate estimate for 
indirect and opportunity costs.

In the interest of maintaining a manageable 
data set for benchmarking, we included 
only those cost activity centers with a 
crucial impact on data breach costs. 
Based on discussions with experts, we 
chose a fixed set of cost activities. After 
collecting benchmark information, we 
carefully reexamined each instrument for 
consistency and completeness.

Research methodology

How we calculate the cost 
of a data breach

To calculate the average cost of a data 
breach, this research excluded very small 
and very large breaches. Data breaches 
examined in the 2023 report ranged in size 
between 2,160 and 101,200 compromised 
records. We used a separate analysis to 
examine the costs of mega breaches; that 
methodology is explained further in the 
“Data breach FAQs” section of this report.

This research used activity\-based 
costing, which identifies activities and 
assigns a cost according to actual use. 
Four process\-related activities drive a 
range of expenditures associated with 
an organization’s data breach: detection 
and escalation, notification, post\-breach 
response and lost business.

Detection and escalation
Activities that enable a company to detect 
the breach, including:

 – Forensic and investigative activities
 – Assessment and audit services
 – Crisis management
 – Communications to executives 

and boards

Notification
Activities that enable the company to notify 
data subjects, data protection regulators 
and other third parties, including:

 – Emails, letters, outbound calls or general 

notices to data subjects
 – Determination of regulatory 

requirements

 – Communication with regulators
 – Engagement of outside experts

Post\-breach response
Activities to help victims of a breach 
communicate with the company and 
conduct redress activities to victims 
and regulators, including:

 – Help desk and inbound communications
 – Credit monitoring and identity 

protection services

 – Issuing of new accounts or credit cards
 – Legal expenditures
 – Product discounts
 – Regulatory fines

Lost business
Activities that attempt to minimize the 
loss of customers, business disruption 
and revenue losses, including:

 – Business disruption and revenue 
losses due to system downtime

 – Cost of losing customers 

and acquiring new customers

 – Reputational damage and 

diminished goodwill

Data breach FAQs

What’s a data breach?
A breach is defined as an event in 
which records containing personally 
identifiable information (PII); financial or 
medical account details; or other secret, 
confidential or proprietary data are 
potentially put at risk. These records can 
be in electronic or paper format. Breaches 
included in the study ranged from 2,200 to 
102,000 compromised records.

What’s a compromised record?
A record is information that reveals 
confidential or proprietary corporate, 
governmental or financial data, or 
identifies an individual whose information 
has been lost or stolen in a data breach. 
Examples include a database with an 
individual’s name, credit card information 

and other PII, or a health record with 
the policyholder’s name and payment 
information.

How do you collect the data?
Our researchers collected in\-depth 
qualitative data through over 3,475 
separate interviews with individuals at 553 
organizations that suffered a data breach 
between March 2022 and March 2023\. 
Interviewees included IT, compliance and 
information security practitioners familiar 
with their organization’s data breach and 
the costs associated with resolving the 
breach. For privacy purposes, we didn’t 
collect organization\-specific information.

How do you calculate the average cost of 
a data breach?
We collected both the direct and indirect 
expenses incurred by the organization. 
Direct expenses included engaging 
forensic experts, outsourcing hotline 
support and providing free credit\-
monitoring subscriptions and discounts 
for future products and services. Indirect 
costs included in\-house investigations 
and communications along with the 
extrapolated value of customer loss 
resulting from turnover or diminished 
customer acquisition rates.

This research represented only events 
directly relevant to the data breach 
experience. Regulations such as the 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
and the California Consumer Privacy Act 
(CCPA) may encourage organizations to 
increase investments in their cybersecurity 
governance technologies. However, such 
activities didn’t directly affect the cost 
of a data breach for this research.

For consistency with prior years, we used 
the same currency translation method 
rather than adjusting accounting costs.

Research methodology

How does benchmark research differ from 
survey research?
The unit of analysis in the Cost of a Data 
Breach Report was the organization. In 
survey research, the unit of analysis is the 
individual. We recruited 553 organizations 
to participate in this study.

Can the average per\-record cost be used 
to calculate the cost of breaches involving 
millions of lost or stolen records?
It’s not consistent with this research to use 
the overall cost per record as a basis for 
calculating the cost of single or multiple 
breaches totaling millions of records. The 
per\-record cost is derived from our study 
of hundreds of data breach events in which 

each event featured 101,200 or fewer 
compromised records. To measure the 
impact of mega breaches that involve one 
million or more records, the study instead 
uses a simulation framework based on a 
sample of 20 events of that size.

Why did you use simulation methods to 
estimate the cost of a mega data breach?
The sample size of 20 companies that 
experienced a mega breach was not large 
enough to support a statistically significant 
analysis using the study’s activity\-based 
cost methods. To remedy this issue, we 
deployed Monte Carlo simulations to 
estimate a range of possible, meaning 
random, outcomes through repeated trials.

In total, we performed more than 250,000 
trials. The grand mean of all sample means 
provided a most likely outcome at each size 
of data breach, ranging from 1 million to 60 
million compromised records.

Are you tracking the same organizations 
each year?
Each annual study involves a different 
sample of companies. To be consistent 
with previous reports, we recruit and 
match companies each year with similar 
characteristics, such as the company’s 
industry, head count, geographic footprint 
and size of data breach. Since starting this 
research in 2005, we have studied the data 
breach experiences of 5,580 organizations.

Research methodology

Research limitations

Our study used a confidential and 
proprietary benchmark method that has 
been successfully deployed in earlier 
research. However, the inherent limitations 
with this benchmark research need to 
be carefully considered before drawing 
conclusions from findings.

Nonstatistical results
Our study drew upon a representative, 
nonstatistical sample of global entities. 
Statistical inferences, margins of error and 
confidence intervals can’t be applied to 
this data, given that our sampling methods 
weren’t scientific.

Nonresponse
Nonresponse bias wasn’t tested, so 
it’s possible that companies that didn’t 
participate are substantially different in 
terms of underlying data breach cost.

Sampling\-frame bias
Because our sampling frame was 
judgmental, the quality of results was 
influenced by the degree to which the 
frame was representative of the population 
of companies being studied. We believe 
that the current sampling frame was biased 
toward companies with more mature 
privacy or information security programs.

Company\-specific information
The benchmark didn’t capture company\-
identifying information. Individuals could 
use categorical response variables to 
disclose demographic information about 
the company and industry category.

Unmeasured factors
We omitted variables from our analyses 
such as leading trends and organizational 
characteristics. The extent to which omitted 
variables might explain benchmark results 
can’t be determined.

Extrapolated cost results
Although certain checks and balances can 
be incorporated into the benchmark 
process, it’s always possible that 
respondents didn’t provide accurate or 
truthful responses. In addition, the use 
of cost extrapolation methods rather 
than actual cost data may inadvertently 
introduce bias and inaccuracies.

Currency conversions
The conversion from local currencies to 
the US dollar deflated average total cost 
estimates in other countries. For purposes 
of consistency with prior years, we decided 
to continue to use the same accounting 
method rather than adjust the cost. It’s 
important to note that this issue may 
affect only the global analysis because all 
country\-level results are shown in local 
currencies. The current real exchange rates 
used in this research report were published 
by the Federal Reserve on 31 March 2023\.
