# 01 → Executive summary
The Cost of a Data Breach Report equips IT, risk management and security leaders with quantifiable evidence to help them better manage their security investments, risk profile and strategic decision-making processes. The 2023 edition represents this report’s 18th consecutive year. This year’s research—conducted independently by Ponemon Institute and sponsored, analyzed and published by IBM Security®—studied 553 organizations impacted by data breaches that occurred between March 2022 and March 2023. The years mentioned in this report refer to the year the report was published, not necessarily the year of the breach. The breaches studied took place across 16 countries and regions and in 17 different industries.
Throughout this report, we’ll examine the root causes and both short-term and long-term consequences of data breaches. We’ll also explore the factors and technologies that enabled companies to limit losses—as well as those that led to increased costs.

### Key findings
**Average total cost of a breach**

The average cost of a data breach reached an all-time high in 2023 of USD 4.45 million. This represents a 2.3% increase from the 2022 cost of USD 4.35 million. Taking a long-term view, the average cost has increased 15.3% from USD 3.86 million in the 2020 report.

**Percentage of organizations planning to increase security investments as a result of a breach**

While data breach costs continued to rise, report participants were almost equally split on whether they plan to increase security investments because of a data breach. The top areas identified for additional investments included incident response (IR) planning and testing, employee training, and threat detection and response technologies.

**The effect of extensive security AI and automation on the financial impact of a breach**

Security AI and automation were shown to be important investments for reducing costs and minimizing time to identify and contain breaches. Organizations that used these capabilities extensively within their approach experienced, on average, a 108-day shorter time to identify and contain the breach. They also reported USD 1.76 million lower data breach costs compared to organizations that didn’t use security AI and automation capabilities.

**1 in 3**

**Number of breaches identified by an organization’s own security teams or tools**

Only one-third of companies discovered the data breach through their own security teams, highlighting a need for better threat detection. 67% of breaches were reported by a benign third party or by the attackers themselves. When attackers disclosed a breach, it cost organizations nearly USD 1 million more compared to internal detection.

**82%**

**The percentage of breaches that involved data stored in the cloud—public, private or multiple environments**

Cloud environments were frequent targets for cyberattackers in 2023. Attackers often gained access to multiple environments, with 39% of breaches spanning multiple environments and incurring a higher-than-average cost of USD 4.75 million.

**53.3%**

**Since 2020, healthcare data breach costs have increased 53.3%**

The highly regulated healthcare industry has seen a considerable rise in data breach costs since 2020. For the 13th year in a row, the healthcare industry reported the most expensive data breaches, at an average cost of USD 10.93 million.

**USD 470,000**

**Additional cost experienced by organizations that didn’t involve law enforcement in a ransomware attack**

This year’s research shows that excluding law enforcement from ransomware incidents led to higher costs. While 63% of respondents said they involved law enforcement, the 37% that didn’t also paid 9.6% more and experienced a 33-day longer breach lifecycle.

**USD 1.02M**

**Average cost difference between breaches that took more than 200 days to find and resolve, and those that took less than 200 days**

Time to identify and contain breaches—known as the breach lifecycle—continues to be integral to the overall financial impact. Breaches with identification and containment times under 200 days cost organizations USD 3.93 million. Those over 200 days cost USD 4.95 million—a difference of 23%.

**USD 1.44M**

**Increase in data breach costs for organizations that had high levels of security system complexity**

Organizations that reported low or no security system complexity experienced an average data breach cost of USD 3.84 million in 2023. Those with high levels of security system complexity reported an average cost of USD 5.28 million, representing an increase of 31.6%.

**USD 1.68M**

**Cost savings from high levels of DevSecOps adoption**

Integrated security testing in the software development process (DevSecOps) showed sizable ROI in 2023. Organizations with high DevSecOps adoption saved USD 1.68 million compared to those with low or no adoption. Compared to other cost-mitigating factors, DevSecOps demonstrated the largest cost savings.

**USD 1.49M**

**Cost savings achieved by organizations with high levels of IR planning and testing**

In addition to being a priority investment for organizations, IR planning and testing emerged as a highly effective tactic for containing the cost of a data breach. Organizations with high levels of IR planning and testing saved USD 1.49 million compared to those with low levels.

**USD 4.45M**

**Global average total cost of a data breach**

**Figure 1.** *The cost of a data breach climbed to a new high.*

Globally, the average cost of a data breach rose to USD 4.45 million, a USD 100,000 increase from 2022. This represents a 2.3% increase from the 2022 average cost of USD 4.35 million. Since 2020, when the average total cost of a data breach was USD 3.86 million, the average total cost has increased 15.3%.

**Figure 2.** *Per-record cost of a data breach also reached a new high.*

In 2023, the average cost per record involved in a data breach was USD 165, a small increase from the 2022 average of USD 164. This matches the relatively small growth from 2021 to 2022, where the cost rose by just USD 3. In the last seven years, the largest increase in average per-record costs was between 2020 and 2021, when the average rose from USD 146 to USD 161 or 10.3%. This study examined breaches sized between 2,200 and 102,000 records.1

**Cost of a data breach divided into four cost segments**
**Figure 6.** *Measured in USD millions*

**Figure 6.** *Lost business costs hit a five-year low.*

Last year’s report saw detection and escalation costs rise to become the costliest category of data breach expenses, indicating a shift toward longer and more-complex breach investigations. The trend continued this year as detection and escalation costs remained in the top spot and rose from USD 1.44 million to USD 1.58 million, demonstrating a change of USD 140,000 or 9.7%. Detection and escalation costs include activities that enable a company to reasonably detect a breach and can include forensic and investigative activities, assessment and audit services, crisis management, and communications to executives and boards.

The other key cost segments of a data breach—lost business cost, post-breach response and notification—also saw changes compared to 2022. Lost business costs dropped 8.5%, from USD 1.42 million in 2022 to USD 1.30 million in 2023. Lost business costs include activities such as business disruptions and revenue losses from system downtime, the cost of lost customers and acquiring new customers, and reputation losses and diminished goodwill.

Notably, the notification cost segment rose from USD 310,000 in 2022 to USD 370,000 in 2023, which represents a 19.4% increase. Post-breach response costs rose by just USD 20,000. Notification costs include activities that enable the company to notify data subjects, data protection regulators and other third parties.

**Figure 7.** *Smaller organizations faced considerably higher data breach costs than last year.*

In 2023, organizations with more than 5,000 employees saw the average cost of a data breach decrease compared to 2022. On the other hand, those with 5,000 or fewer employees saw considerable increases in the average cost of a data breach.

Organizations with fewer than 500 employees reported that the average impact of a data breach increased from USD 2.92 million to USD 3.31 million or 13.4%. Those with 500–1,000 employees saw an increase of 21.4%, from USD 2.71 million to USD 3.29 million. In the 1,001–5,000 employee range, the average cost of a data breach increased from USD 4.06 million to USD 4.87 million, rising nearly 20%.

In the 10,001–25,000 range, respondents reported an average cost of USD 5.46 million, a decrease of 1.8% from 2022’s figure of USD 5.56 million. Organizations with more than 25,000 employees saw the average cost drop from USD 5.56 million in 2022 to USD 5.42 million in 2023, a decrease of USD 140,000 or 2.5%.

**Figures 9a and 9b.** *Customer PII was the costliest—and most common—record compromised.*

Of all record types, customer and employee personal identifiable information (PII) was the costliest to have compromised. In 2023, customer PII such as names and Social Security numbers cost organizations USD 183 per record, with employee PII close behind at USD 181 per record. The least expensive record type to have compromised is anonymized customer data, which cost organizations USD 138 per record in 2023.

As was the case in 2022 and 2021, customer PII was the most commonly breached record type in 2023. 52% of all breaches involved some form of customer PII. This is an increase of five percentage points from 2022, when customer PII accounted for 47% of all data compromised. The second-most commonly compromised data type was employee PII at 40%. Compromised employee PII has seen sizable growth from 2021, when it only accounted for 26% of all records compromised.

Compromised intellectual property grew three percentage points since 2022, while anonymized (non-PII) data dropped seven percentage points from 2022—decreasing from 33% to 26%. Other corporate data, such as financial information and client lists, increased from 15% of data compromised in 2022 to 21% in 2023.

### Initial attack vectors
This section examines the initial attack vector identified for data breaches in the study and its impact on the breach cost and timeline. It identifies the most common root causes for data breaches in the report and compares the average cost of breaches for each category as well as the average time to identify and contain those breaches. Phishing and stolen or compromised credentials were the two most prevalent attack vectors in this year’s report, and both also ranked among the top four costliest incident types.

**Figure 10.** *Phishing and stolen or compromised credentials were the two most common initial attack vectors.*

Phishing and stolen or compromised credentials were responsible for 16% and 15% of breaches, respectively, with phishing moving into the lead spot by a small margin over stolen credentials, which was the most common vector in the 2022 report. Cloud misconfiguration was identified as the initial vector for 11% of attacks, followed by business email compromise at 9%. This year, for the first time, the report examined both zero-day (unknown) vulnerabilities as well as known, unpatched vulnerabilities as the source of the data breach and found that more than 5% of the breaches studied originated from known vulnerabilities that had yet to be patched.

Although relatively rare at 6% of occurrences, attacks initiated by malicious insiders were the costliest, at an average of USD 4.90 million, which is 9.6% higher than the global average cost of USD 4.45 million per data breach. Phishing was the most prevalent attack vector and the second most expensive at USD 4.76 million. Breaches attributed to system error were the least costly, at an average of USD 3.9
