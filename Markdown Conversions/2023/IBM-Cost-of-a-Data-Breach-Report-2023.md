# Executive summary
The Cost of a Data Breach Report equips IT, risk management and security leaders with quantifiable evidence to help them better manage their security investments, risk profile and strategic decision-making processes. The 2023 edition represents this report’s 18th consecutive year. This year’s research—conducted independently by Ponemon Institute and sponsored, analyzed and published by IBM Security®—studied 553 organizations impacted by data breaches that occurred between March 2022 and March 2023. The years mentioned in this report refer to the year the report was published, not necessarily the year of the breach. The breaches studied took place across 16 countries and regions and in 17 different industries.

Throughout this report, we’ll examine the root causes and both short-term and long-term consequences of data breaches. We’ll also explore the factors and technologies that enabled companies to limit losses—as well as those that led to increased costs.

Each year, we continue to evolve the Cost of a Data Breach Report to match new technologies, emerging tactics and recent events. For the first time, this year’s research explores:

- How breaches are identified: whether by an organization’s own security teams, another third party or the attacker
- The impact of involving law enforcement in a ransomware attack
- The effect of ransomware playbooks and workflows
- Specific costs associated with regulatory fines
- If and how companies plan to increase security investment as a result of a breach
- The impact of the following mitigation strategies:
    - Threat intelligence
    - Vulnerability and risk management
    - Attack surface management (ASM)
    - Managed security service providers (MSSPs)

## What’s new in the 2023 report
As the cost of a breach continues to increase, this report delivers essential insights to help security and IT teams better manage risk and limit potential losses. The report is divided into five major sections:

- The executive summary with key findings and what’s new in the 2023 edition
- In-depth analysis on the complete findings, including breach costs by geographic region and industry
- Security recommendations from IBM Security experts based on this report’s results
- Demographics of organizations and industry definitions
- The study’s methodology, including how costs were calculated

The key findings described here are based on IBM Security analysis of research data compiled by Ponemon Institute. Cost amounts in this report are measured in US dollars (USD).

## Key findings
**Average total cost of a breach**

The average cost of a data breach reached an all-time high in 2023 of USD 4.45 million. This represents a 2.3% increase from the 2022 cost of USD 4.35 million. Taking a long-term view, the average cost has increased 15.3% from USD 3.86 million in the 2020 report.

**Percentage of organizations planning to increase security investments as a result of a breach**

While data breach costs continued to rise, report participants were almost equally split on whether they plan to increase security investments because of a data breach. The top areas identified for additional investments included incident response (IR) planning and testing, employee training, and threat detection and response technologies.

**The effect of extensive security AI and automation on the financial impact of a breach**

Security AI and automation were shown to be important investments for reducing costs and minimizing time to identify and contain breaches. Organizations that used these capabilities extensively within their approach experienced, on average, a 108-day shorter time to identify and contain the breach. They also reported USD 1.76 million lower data breach costs compared to organizations that didn’t use security AI and automation capabilities.

![Image description: Graph showing average cost of a breach as USD 4.45M, percentage of organizations planning to increase security investments as 51%, and cost savings from security AI and automation as USD 1.76M]

**Number of breaches identified by an organization’s own security teams or tools**

Only one-third of companies discovered the data breach through their own security teams, highlighting a need for better threat detection. 67% of breaches were reported by a benign third party or by the attackers themselves. When attackers disclosed a breach, it cost organizations nearly USD 1 million more compared to internal detection.

**The percentage of breaches that involved data stored in the cloud—public, private or multiple environments**

Cloud environments were frequent targets for cyberattackers in 2023. Attackers often gained access to multiple environments, with 39% of breaches spanning multiple environments and incurring a higher-than-average cost of USD 4.75 million.

**Since 2020, healthcare data breach costs have increased**

The highly regulated healthcare industry has seen a considerable rise in data breach costs since 2020. For the 13th year in a row, the healthcare industry reported the most expensive data breaches, at an average cost of USD 10.93 million.

**Additional cost experienced by organizations that didn’t involve law enforcement in a ransomware attack**

This year’s research shows that excluding law enforcement from ransomware incidents led to higher costs. While 63% of respondents said they involved law enforcement, the 37% that didn’t also paid 9.6% more and experienced a 33-day longer breach lifecycle.

**Average cost difference between breaches that took more than 200 days to find and resolve, and those that took less than 200 days**

Time to identify and contain breaches—known as the breach lifecycle—continues to be integral to the overall financial impact. Breaches with identification and containment times under 200 days cost organizations USD 3.93 million. Those over 200 days cost USD 4.95 million—a difference of 23%.

**Increase in data breach costs for organizations that had high levels of security system complexity**

Organizations that reported low or no security system complexity experienced an average data breach cost of USD 3.84 million in 2023. Those with high levels of security system complexity reported an average cost of USD 5.28 million, representing an increase of 31.6%.

**Cost savings from high levels of DevSecOps adoption**

Integrated security testing in the software development process (DevSecOps) showed sizable ROI in 2023. Organizations with high DevSecOps adoption saved USD 1.68 million compared to those with low or no adoption. Compared to other cost-mitigating factors, DevSecOps demonstrated the largest cost savings.

**Cost savings achieved by organizations with high levels of IR planning and testing**

In addition to being a priority investment for organizations, IR planning and testing emerged as a highly effective tactic for containing the cost of a data breach. Organizations with high levels of IR planning and testing saved USD 1.49 million compared to those with low levels.

## Global highlights
The Cost of a Data Breach Report provides a global picture of the cost of data breaches, built using data from over 553 breaches in 16 different countries and taking into account hundreds of cost factors. This section examines critical metrics at the level of global average. We also explore the average per-record comparative costs between countries and industries.

**Global average total cost of a data breach**

Globally, the average cost of a data breach rose to USD 4.45 million, a USD 100,000 increase from 2022. This represents a 2.3% increase from the 2022 average cost of USD 4.35 million. Since 2020, when the average total cost of a data breach was USD 3.86 million, the average total cost has increased 15.3%.

![Image description: Graph showing total cost of a data breach from 2017 to 2023]

**Per-record cost of a data breach also reached a new high**

In 2023, the average cost per record involved in a data breach was USD 165, a small increase from the 2022 average of USD 164. This matches the relatively small growth from 2021 to 2022, where the cost rose by just USD 3. In the last seven years, the largest increase in average per-record costs was between 2020 and 2021, when the average rose from USD 146 to USD 161 or 10.3%. This study examined breaches sized between 2,200 and 102,000 records.[^1]

[^1]: It’s not consistent with this research to use the per-record cost to calculate the cost of single or multiple breaches above 102,000 records. For more information, see the “Research methodology” section.

Of this year’s top five, Japan is the only country that didn’t appear on the 2022 top five list, moving up from the number 6 most expensive spot last year. The top 5 list last year also included the United Kingdom (UK) at an average data breach cost of USD 5.05 million. This year, the UK saw a significant drop in average cost at USD 4.21 million—down 16.6% from last year—resulting in placement just outside of the top five.

The United States again had the highest average total cost of a data breach at USD 9.48 million, an increase of 0.4% from last year’s USD 9.44 million. Like last year, the Middle East had the second-highest average total cost of a data breach at USD 8.07 million, up 8.2% from USD 7.46 million.

![Image description: Table showing top 5 countries with highest average cost of a data breach in 2023 and 2022]

In Canada, the average total cost of a data breach decreased from USD 5.64 million to USD 5.13 million or 9%. The average cost also decreased in Germany, dropping from USD 4.85 million to USD 4.67 million or 3.7%. Japan saw the average drop slightly, from USD 4.57 million to USD 4.52 million or 1.1%.

![Image description: Table showing cost of a data breach by country or region]

Across industries, healthcare reported the highest costs for the 13th year in a row.

Healthcare continues to experience the highest data breach costs of all industries, increasing from USD 10.10 million in 2022 to USD 10.93 million in 2023—an increase of 8.2%. Over the past three years, the average cost of a data breach in healthcare has grown 53.3%, increasing more than USD 3 million compared to the average cost of USD 7.13 million in 2020. Healthcare faces high levels of industry regulation and is considered critical infrastructure by the US government. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the industry has seen notably higher average data breach costs. The top five most costly industries underwent some changes from last year’s rankings. Technology dropped out of the top five while the industrial sector was added, showing a 5.8% increase as it moved from the seventh-highest to the fifth. According to IBM threat intelligence, manufacturing is the industry most commonly targeted by cybercriminals.

![Image description: Table showing top 5 industries with highest average cost of a data breach in 2023 and 2022]

![Image description: Graph showing cost of a data breach by industry in 2023 and 2022]

**Mean times to identify and contain breaches stayed roughly the same.**

Compared to 2022, both the mean time to identify (MTTI) and the mean time to contain (MTTC) breaches saw only marginal changes. Mean time to identify refers to the time it takes an organization to uncover a security breach. Mean time to contain refers to the time required to resolve a security breach once it has been identified.

In 2022, it took organizations 207 days to identify a breach. In 2023, it took only 204 days. On the other hand, organizations required an average of 73 days to contain breaches in 2023, while they required just 70 days on average in 2022. The highest mean times to contain and identify breaches both occurred in 2021, at 212 and 75 days, respectively.

![Image description: Graph showing mean times to identify and contain breaches from 2017 to 2023]

**Lost business costs hit a five-year low.**

Last year’s report saw detection and escalation costs rise to become the costliest category of data breach expenses, indicating a shift toward longer and more-complex breach investigations. The trend continued this year as detection and escalation costs remained in the top spot and rose from USD 1.44 million to USD 1.58 million, demonstrating a change of USD 140,000 or 9.7%. Detection and escalation costs include activities that enable a company to reasonably detect a breach and can include forensic and investigative activities, assessment and audit services, crisis management, and communications to executives and boards.

The other key cost segments of a data breach—lost business cost, post-breach response and notification—also saw changes compared to 2022. Lost business costs dropped 8.5%, from USD 1.42 million in 2022 to USD 1.30 million in 2023. Lost business costs include activities such as business disruptions and revenue losses from system downtime, the cost of lost customers and acquiring new customers, and reputation losses and diminished goodwill.

Notably, the notification cost segment rose from USD 310,000 in 2022 to USD 370,000 in 2023, which represents a 19.4% increase. Post-breach response costs rose by just USD 20,000. Notification costs include activities that enable the company to notify data subjects, data protection regulators and other third parties.

![Image description: Graph showing cost of a data breach divided into four cost segments from 2018 to 2023]

**Smaller organizations faced considerably higher data breach costs than last year.**

In 2023, organizations with more than 5,000 employees saw the average cost of a data breach decrease compared to 2022. On the other hand, those with 5,000 or fewer employees saw considerable increases in the average cost of a data breach.

Organizations with fewer than 500 employees reported that the average impact of a data breach increased from USD 2.92 million to USD 3.31 million or 13.4%. Those with 500–1,000 employees saw an increase of 21.4%, from USD 2.71 million to USD 3.29 million. In the 1,001–5,000 employee range, the average cost of a data breach increased from USD 4.06 million to USD 4.87 million, rising nearly 20%.

In the 10,001–25,000 range, respondents reported an average cost of USD 5.46 million, a decrease of 1.8% from 2022’s figure of USD 5.56 million. Organizations with more than 25,000 employees saw the average cost drop from USD 5.56 million in 2022 to USD 5.42 million in 2023, a decrease of USD 140,000 or 2.5%.

![Image description: Graph showing cost of a data breach by head count from 2021 to 2023]

**Most organizations continue to increase the prices of services and products as a result of a data breach.**

The majority (57%) of respondents indicated that data breaches led to an increase in the pricing of their business offerings, passing on costs to consumers. This finding is similar to our 2022 report, where 60% of respondents said they increased prices.

![Image description: Pie chart showing percentage of organizations that increased the cost of services and products as a result of a data breach]

**Customer PII was the costliest—and most common—record compromised.**

Of all record types, customer and employee personal identifiable information (PII) was the costliest to have compromised. In 2023, customer PII such as names and Social Security numbers cost organizations USD 183 per record, with employee PII close behind at USD 181 per record. The least expensive record type to have compromised is anonymized customer data, which cost organizations USD 138 per record in 2023.

As was the case in 2022 and 2021, customer PII was the most commonly breached record type in 2023. 52% of all breaches involved some form of customer PII. This is an increase of five percentage points from 2022, when customer PII accounted for 47% of all data compromised. The second-most commonly compromised data type was employee PII at 40%. Compromised employee PII has seen sizable growth from 2021, when it only accounted for 26% of all records compromised.

Compromised intellectual property grew three percentage points since 2022, while anonymized (non-PII) data dropped seven percentage points from 2022—decreasing from 33% to 26%. Other corporate data, such as financial information and client lists, increased from 15% of data compromised in 2022 to 21% in 2023.

## Initial attack vectors
This section examines the initial attack vector identified for data breaches in the study and its impact on the breach cost and timeline. It identifies the most common root causes for data breaches in the report and compares the average cost of breaches for each category as well as the average time to identify and contain those breaches. Phishing and stolen or compromised credentials were the two most prevalent attack vectors in this year’s report, and both also ranked among the top four costliest incident types.

**Phishing and stolen or compromised credentials were the two most common initial attack vectors.**

Phishing and stolen or compromised credentials were responsible for 16% and 15% of breaches, respectively, with phishing moving into the lead spot by a small margin over stolen credentials, which was the most common vector in the 2022 report. Cloud misconfiguration was identified as the initial vector for 11% of attacks, followed by business email compromise at 9%. This year, for the first time, the report examined both zero-day (unknown) vulnerabilities as well as known, unpatched vulnerabilities as the source of the data breach and found that more than 5% of the breaches studied originated from known vulnerabilities that had yet to be patched.

Although relatively rare at 6% of occurrences, attacks initiated by malicious insiders were the costliest, at an average of USD 4.90 million, which is 9.6% higher than the global average cost of USD 4.45 million per data breach. Phishing was the most prevalent attack vector and the second most expensive at USD 4.76 million. Breaches attributed to system error were the least costly, at an average of USD 3.96 million, and the least common, at 5% of occurrences.

![Image description: Graph showing cost and frequency of a data breach by initial attack vector]

**Breaches that initiated with stolen or compromised credentials and malicious insiders took the longest to resolve.**

This year, it took nearly 11 months (328 days) to identify and contain data breaches resulting from stolen or compromised credentials, on average, and about 10 months (308 days) to resolve breaches that were initiated by a malicious insider. Those two vectors, along with phishing and business email compromise, were also responsible for the costliest breaches. As a point of comparison, the overall mean time to identify and contain a data breach was 277 days or just over nine months. That figure has remained relatively constant over the past few years of the report.

![Image description: Graph showing time to identify and contain a data breach by initial attack vector]

## Identifying attacks
This section looks at how breaches were identified and the differences in cost and containment time based on the identification method, analyses that are reported for the first time this year. There are three categories that define how breaches are identified: by an organization’s internal security teams and tools, including managed security service providers (MSSPs); by a benign third party, such as a security researcher or law enforcement; and by disclosure from the attacker, as in the case of ransomware.

**Breaches were most commonly identified by a benign third party.**

40% of breaches were identified by a benign third party or outsider, whereas 33% of breaches were identified by internal teams and tools. Over one-quarter or 27% of breaches were disclosed by the attacker as part of a ransomware attack.

![Image description: Pie chart showing how the breach was identified]

**Data breaches disclosed by the attacker, such as with ransomware, cost significantly more.**

Attacks disclosed by attackers had an average cost of USD 5.23 million, which was a 19.5% or USD 930,000 difference over the average cost of breaches identified through internal security teams or tools of USD 4.30 million. Additionally, breaches disclosed by attackers cost 16.1% or USD 780,000 more than the USD 4.45 million average cost of a data breach for 2023. Breaches identified by an organization’s own security teams and tools were significantly less expensive, costing nearly USD 1 million less than incidents disclosed by the attacker.

![Image description: Graph showing cost of a data breach by how the breach was identified]

**Data breaches disclosed by the attacker also took the longest time to identify and contain.**

Respondents required a mean time of 320 days to identify and contain breaches disclosed by the attacker. This time frame was 80 additional days or 28.2% longer compared to breaches identified internally, which took a mean time of 241 days to identify and contain. The mean time to identify and contain a breach disclosed by the attacker took 47 days or 15.9% longer compared to breaches identified by a benign third party.

![Image description: Graph showing time to identify and contain a breach by how the breach was identified]

## Data breach lifecycle
The data breach lifecycle is defined as the elapsed time between the initial detection of the breach and its containment. “Time to identify” describes the time, in days, it takes to discover an incident. “Time to contain” refers to the time, in days, it takes for an organization to resolve the situation and restore service after the breach has been detected. These two metrics help determine the effectiveness of an organization’s IR and containment processes.

**A shorter data breach lifecycle continues to be associated with lower data breach costs.**

A shorter data breach lifecycle of fewer than 200 days was associated with an average cost of USD 3.93 million, while a longer lifecycle of more than 200 days was associated with an average cost of USD 4.95 million. This reflects a 23% difference and a cost savings of USD 1.02 million for the shorter lifecycle.

Looking back at previous years, the average cost of a data breach based on the 200-day lifecycle has been relatively consistent, although it changed incrementally. For a data breach lifecycle of fewer than 200 days, the 2023 value of USD 3.93 million grew 5.1% from the previous year’s average cost of USD 3.74 million. For a data breach lifecycle of more than 200 days, the 2023 value of USD 4.95 million grew 1.9% from the previous year’s average cost of USD 4.86 million. The average cost savings of USD 1.02 million reported in 2023 reflects an 8.9% decrease from 2022’s cost savings of USD 1.12 million.

![Image description: Graph showing cost of a data breach based on the breach lifecycle]

## Key cost factors
The types of security technologies and practices employed within an organization are among many factors that influence the mean cost of a data breach. This section quantifies 27 cost factors to help security and risk decision-makers understand the degree to which these factors amplify or mitigate costs. These factors aren’t additive, so it’s not consistent with the research methodology to add multiple cost factors together to calculate the potential cost of a breach.

This year, the Cost of a Data Breach Report considers several new factors, including supply chain breaches, ASM tools, data security and protection software, endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, threat intelligence, proactive threat hunting, IR teams, and security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) tools.

**The impact of 27 factors on the mean cost of a data breach.**

The chart demonstrates the average cost difference of breaches at organizations with these cost-influencing factors compared to the overall average data breach cost of USD 4.45 million. Cost mitigators describe those factors that are associated with a lower-than-average breach cost, while cost amplifiers are associated with a higher-than-average breach cost.

The three factors that rank most effective as cost mitigators—those associated with the biggest cost reduction—are the adoption of a DevSecOps approach, employee training, and IR planning and testing. For example, breaches at organizations with a DevSecOps approach in place had an average cost that was USD 249,000 less than the 2023 mean cost of a data breach of USD 4.45 million or approximately USD 4.20 million.

The biggest cost amplifiers were security system complexity, security skills shortage, and noncompliance with regulations. For example, breaches at organizations with security system complexity had an average cost of USD 241,000 more than the 2023 mean cost of a data breach of USD 4.45 million or approximately USD 4.69 million.

![Image description: Graph showing impact of key factors on total cost of a data breach]

**The three most impactful cost amplifiers out of 27 factors.**

This chart compares organizations with the highest levels of a top-ranking cost amplifier to those with the lowest level, which in some cases could mean no instance of that same factor. This comparison differs from the prior analysis (Figure 16) in which a high presence of these factors is compared to the mean. There was a difference of USD 1.58 million or 34.6% between high levels and low levels of secrity skills shortage. A difference of USD 1.44 million or 31.6% occurred between high levels and low levels of security system complexity. And there was a difference of USD 1.04 million or 23% between high levels and low levels of noncompliance with regulations.

Organizations with a high level of security skills shortage had a USD 5.36 million average cost, which was USD 910,000 higher than the average cost of a data breach, a difference of 18.6%. Those with a high level of security system complexity had a USD 5.28 million average cost, for a difference of USD 830,000 or 17.1% compared to the average cost of a data breach. Organizations with a high level of noncompliance with regulations showed an average cost of USD 5.05 million, which exceeded the average cost of a data breach by USD 560,000, a difference of 12.6%.

![Image description: Graph showing cost of a data breach for organizations with a high level versus low level of three cost-amplifying factors]

**The three most impactful cost mitigators out of 27 factors.**

The chart compares organizations with the highest levels of a top-ranking cost mitigator to those with the lowest level, which in some cases could mean no instance of that same factor. The average cost of a breach showed a difference of USD 1.68 million or 38.4% between organizations with high levels and low levels of a DevSecOps approach. There was a difference of USD 1.49 million or 34.1% between high levels and little to no IR planning and testing. And last, there was a difference of USD 1.5 million or 33.9% between high levels and low levels of employee training.

Organizations with high levels of these cost mitigators present had a significantly lower than average cost of a data breach. High-level DevSecOps adopters had an average cost of USD 3.54 million—a difference of USD 910,000 or 22.8% compared to the overall average cost of a data breach. Organizations with a low usage of a DevSecOps approach had an average cost of USD 5.22 million, which was significantly higher by a difference of USD 770,000 or 15.9% compared to the average cost of a data breach.

![Image description: Graph showing cost of a data breach for organizations with a high level versus low level of three cost-mitigating factors]

## Ransomware and destructive attacks
This year, ransomware and destructive attacks[^2] accounted for 24% and 25% of malicious attacks, respectively. As in the 2022 report, we looked at the lifecycle of these types of breaches and the impact of paying a ransom compared to not paying a ransom. This study doesn’t include the cost of the ransom in calculating the total cost of the breach. In the 2023 report, for the first time, we examined the influence of involving law enforcement in the effort to contain a ransomware attack.

[^2]: Destructive attacks are defined as attacks that render systems inoperable and challenge reconstitution. They may or may not also involve a ransom.

**Nearly one-quarter of attacks involved ransomware.**

Destructive attacks that left systems inoperable accounted for one out of every four attacks, and another 24% involved ransomware. Business partner and software supply chain attacks accounted for 15% and 12% of attacks, respectively.

![Image description: Graph showing share of total breaches by type of malicious attack]

**Ransomware attack costs increased significantly.**

At USD 5.13 million, the average cost of a ransomware attack in the 2023 report increased 13% from the average cost of USD 4.54 million in the 2022 report. At USD 5.24 million, the average cost of a destructive attack in the 2023 report also increased 2.3% from the average cost of USD 5.12 million in the 2022 report.

![Image description: Graph showing cost of a ransomware or destructive attack]

**Organizations that involved law enforcement saw significant time and cost savings.**

37% of ransomware victims opted not to involve law enforcement to help contain a ransomware breach, but those that did experienced a less costly ransomware breach overall. The average cost of a ransomware breach was USD 5.11 million when law enforcement wasn’t involved and USD 4.64 million when law enforcement was involved, for a difference of 9.6% or USD 470,000.

![Image description: Pie chart showing share of ransomware attacks with law enforcement involved]

**Law enforcement helped shorten time to identify and contain ransomware breaches.**

Total time to identify and contain a ransomware breach was 11.4% or 33 days shorter with law enforcement involvement, at 273 days in total compared to 306 days. The mean time to contain a ransomware breach was 63 days or 23.8% shorter with law enforcement involvement compared to 80 days without. It’s clear that involving law enforcement can help reduce the cost and duration of a ransomware breach.

**Automated response playbooks or workflows cut down the time to contain a ransomware breach.**

Among organizations that experienced a ransomware attack, those that had automated response playbooks or workflows designed specifically for ransomware attacks were able to contain them in 68 days or 16% fewer days compared to the average of 80 days for organizations without automated response playbooks or workflows.

**Paying the ransom led to minimal cost savings.**

Organizations that paid the ransom during a ransomware attack achieved only a small difference in total cost, at USD 5.06 million compared to USD 5.17 million, a cost difference of USD 110,000 or 2.2%. However, this calculation doesn’t include the cost of the ransom itself. Given the high cost of most ransomware demands, organizations that paid the ransom likely ended up spending more overall than those that didn’t pay the ransom. In the 2022 report, the total cost savings were USD 630,000, with a total cost difference of 13.1%, again not including the cost of the ransom itself. The data shows that paying a ransom has become increasingly less advantageous overall, with an 82.5% decrease in savings from the 2022 to 2023 reports.
