## A Letter from the CEO
On July 1, 2003, the world’s first law that required consumers to be notified their personal information had been compromised in a data breach went into effect in California. The law only applied to residents of the Golden State and it was primarily aimed at the risk of the time – the exposure of personal information stored in filing cabinets and on disks and drives. Dumpster diving and stolen laptops were the top sources of breaches.

While many businesses were aware of the new law and the need to inform California residents of a loss of their personally identifiable information (PII), most consumers were not. Especially outside California.

That all changed in 2005 when a Georgia-based company sent letters to a small group of California consumers alerting them that their PII had been obtained by a group of organized criminals posing as legitimate businesses. On Valentine’s Day, “Data Breach Notice” appeared in the popular lexicon for the first time.

That original notice not only generated intense interest in California, but around the world. Major media outlets in the U.S. and Europe covered the story each day for 30 days and Congress held a series of hearings on the topic of data breaches. Soon, consumers outside California were informed they, too, may have been the victim of the data breach in recognition that criminals and data did not recognize state lines.

By the end of 2005, 156 other organizations had issued breach notices tracked by the ITRC and a handful of states adopted a California-style breach notice law. Fast forward to 2018 when the final two states adopted breach notice requirements, following the lead of 90 other countries, all U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia.

However, Congress did not enact a federal breach notice law. Even in the wake of a single 2017 data breach linked to a Nation/State that compromised the personal information of nearly every adult in the U.S. and millions of adults in other countries. The result was a patchwork of state laws and federal regulations with different definitions of PII, triggers for a notice, methods of notification, time frames for issuing a notice, and penalties for failing to issue a notice.

In the years between 2005 and 2018, technology advanced and identity criminals’ skills improved. Paper documents in file cabinets accessible in locked rooms were replaced by cloud environments accessible via the internet. Identity criminals shifted from lone individuals hacking for fun and street cred in their parents’ basement to highly sophisticated groups operating out of glass and stone towers in far-away lands. Hollywood shows us people in hoodies while the real identity criminals flash cash, drive Lambos and operate call centers.

First, we must acknowledge the significant impact of Supply Chain Attacks and the effect they have on all organizations. A single supply chain attack can directly or indirectly impact hundreds or thousands of businesses that rely on the same vendor. Stronger reporting requirements can help warn other vulnerable businesses of the risk associated with a similar attack. Increased due diligence when it comes to vendors and data protection are also in order.

Second, the two-decade old legislative and regulatory framework designed to alert consumers to breaches is broken. A Supply Chain Attack victim from 2020 confirmed in 2023 what was suspected for years: Businesses under or non-report breaches. We need to bring a level of uniformity to the breach notice process to help protect both consumers and business.

The sheer scale of the 2023 data compromises is overwhelming. Just the increase from the past record high to 2023’s number is larger than the annual number of events from 2005 until 2020 (except for 2017). But, we cannot let complacency, frustration, or weariness lead us to surrender the fight to protect identity crime victims. We’re not about to give-up or give-in and we hope you will join us as we seek to start a different conversation about protecting identities in 2024.

Off-the-shelf hacker tools lowered the barrier to entry for launching attacks and the wealth of personal information available from data breaches and identity scams made it easy to impersonate an individual or business using social engineering. This was the environment in 2021 that created the highest number of data compromises ever tracked by the ITRC – 1,860[^1] events impacted an estimated ~300M victims.

The highest, that is, until 2023.

In the pages that follow you’ll see the new record high: 3,205 publicly reported data compromises that impacted an estimated 353,027,892 individuals. That’s a 72 percent (72%) increase in events over the previous high-water mark and 78 percent (78%) over 2022.

See Figure 1

Each year we are asked “why the increase in events?” and “what can be done to protect against a data breach?” There’s never any one reason why compromises go up or down just as there are no actions that are 100 percent effective in stopping breaches or the identity crimes that result. We do believe there are trends that need to be highlighted and actions that need to be considered if we are to slow or stop the pace of data breaches and exposures.

[^1]: Audits of 2021 and 2022 compromises resulted in a reduction in the total number of data compromises for those years due to breaches originally reported as separate events later being updated as related events. The total number of compromises in full-year 2021 has been adjusted downward by two (2) events to 1,860 and full-year 2022 adjusted downward by one (1) event to 1,801.

![Figure 1 | Total Compromises, Year over Year](Figure 1 | Total Compromises, Year over Year)

## Glossary of Terms
One of the issues that leads to confusion around data compromises is the fact there is no single definition or set of terms used to describe a data breach that requires a notice in the U.S. Since data breach notices are largely creatures of state law, there are as many definitions and trigger events as there are states, territories and federal districts. Adding to the confusion, Federal government agencies also have their own set of terms and requirements for issuing a data breach notice, many of which have recently changed or are in the process of changing. (See SEC, FTC and FCC rule changes announced in 2023.)

Since 2020, the ITRC has published the definitions we use in compiling and publishing this report. We have updated our terms for the 2023 report.

**Data Compromise** – The overall term used to refer to events where personal information is accessible by unauthorized individuals and/or for unintended purposes. This includes data breaches, data exposures, and data leaks.

**Identity Theft** – Taking personally identifiable information (PII) as protected by state or federal laws.

**Identity Fraud** – Using stolen personally identifiable information (PII).

**Data Breach** – When unauthorized individuals access and/or remove personal information from the place where is it stored.

**Identity Crimes** – The overall term for a wide variety of state and federal criminal acts that are related to the theft and/or misuse of personal information.

**Data Exposure** – When personal information is available for access and/or removal from the place where it is stored, but there is no evidence the information has been accessed by unauthorized individuals. This typically involves cloud-based data storage where cybersecurity protections are incorrectly configured or have not been applied.

**Data Leak** – When personal information that is publicly available or willingly shared on social media and represents no or low risk when viewed as individual records; however, when aggregated, the sheer volume of personal information available in a single database creates risk to the data subjects and value for identity criminals who specialize in social engineering and phishing. When these databases are left unprotected or otherwise made publicly available, the ITRC classifies these events as Data Leaks.

## Executive Summary
The number of data compromises reported in the United States surpassed two significant milestones in 2023: the highest number of data events reported in a single year and exceeding 2,000 (and ultimately 3,000) events in a single year. The total number of data breaches, exposures, leaks and unspecified events reached 3,205, impacting an estimated 353,027,892 victims, including those affected by multiple compromises. The 2023 compromises represent a 78 percentage point increase over the previous year and a 72 percentage point hike from the previous all-time high number of compromises (1,860) set in 2021.

More than nine percent (9%) of the ~3,700 U.S. publicly traded companies issued a data breach notice in 2023, impacting ~143M victims. The 358 notices from publicly traded companies represented 11 percent (11%) of the overall number of compromises. Yet, public companies accounted for 40 percent (40%) of all data compromise victims. That compares to 2,847 data events at all other organizations, impacting ~210M victims during the course of the year.

Analysis of the breach notices also indicated that public companies were more likely to withhold actionable information about their data breach than other entities. Publicly traded companies withheld information about an attack in 47 percent (47%) of notices compared to 46 percent (46%) of private companies, government agencies, education institutions and nonprofit organizations.

As in each of the past five (5) years, the vast majority of data compromises were linked to cyberattacks in 2023. Phishing-related and ransomware attacks were down slightly, while malware and Zero Day attacks jumped significantly compared to previous years.

Compromises related to System and Human errors more than tripled in 2023, led by a 590 percent (590%) increase in data being exposed in emails and correspondence. Breaches involving a physical action – loss of a document, device theft, skimming devices – were relatively flat with single-digit increases. Physical breaches are down 65 percent (65%) since 2018.

The estimated number of victims impacted represents a 16 percentage point reduction from 2022, when more than half of the total annual victim count was related to three breaches announced late in the previous year. This is consistent with a general trend of the number of estimated victims dropping slightly each year. This is a result of organized identity criminals focusing on specific information and identity-related fraud and scams rather than mass attacks.

Based on publicly reported compromises, the total number of compromises reflects a trend where most industries saw increases, and a handful saw slight decreases in reported attacks. However, three (3) industries reported more than double the number of compromises compared to 2022: Healthcare, Financial Services and Transportation.

Healthcare led all industries in terms of the number of reported compromises in each of the past five (5) years, but Utilities companies led in the estimated number of victims in 2023.

**Analysis – 2023 vs 2022**

The trend toward opaque breach notices discussed in the 2022 ITRC Data Breach Report accelerated in 2023. The number of breach notices without specific information about the root cause of an attack nearly doubled year-over-year. In the 12 months that just ended, more than 1,400 public breach notices did not contain information about an attack vector compared to 716 in 2022 – a 98 percentage point increase.

According to a settlement agreement reached in late 2023 with 49 state attorneys general, Blackbaud notified more than 13,000 customers about the data breach and the loss of their data but did not notify the individual victims whose personal information was exposed.

Of the 13,000 Blackbaud customers impacted by the breach, only 604 organizations filed public notices tracked by the ITRC, representing an estimated 12.8M victims. The gap between the thousands of organizations that lost data and the hundreds who notified victims is a clear indicator that data breach notice laws and regulations have failed to achieve the original goal of protecting businesses and individuals.

The combination of more data from more compromises, along with revolutionary technology, means we must consider significant changes to how we protect personal information and respond when it is compromised. There are three areas where the ITRC suggests action that will help reduce the rate and impact of data breaches on individual and business victims.

Two clear trends emerged in 2023 beyond the dramatic rise in overall data compromises: 1) an equally dramatic increase in the number of organizations being impacted by Supply Chain Attacks, and 2) a trend highlighted by the rise in Supply Chain Attacks – the further break-down in the breach notification framework.

While the growth in the number of organizations targeted in Supply Chain Attacks has been relatively slow since 2018, the number of organizations impacted has surged by more than 2,600 percent (2,600%) over the same time period. The estimated number of victims has also surged to more than 54M victims, or 15 percent (15%) of the overall number of victims in 2023.

In the 20 years since California’s first-of-its-kind data breach notice law went into effect, nearly 19,000 data breaches have been publicly reported in the United States. In the U.S., there were an average of ~12 (12.3) data breaches reported each business day in 2023, while in the European Union, there were an average of 912 compromises reported each business day in 2022; the last year data was available.

The rise in Supply Chain Attacks where the breached entity may not own the data that is stolen has called into question who is responsible for making the determination of risk and notifying victims of the compromise. The 2020 Supply Chain Attack against Blackbaud illustrates the issues surrounding notification and highlights the fact breaches are under-reported.

### Trends in 2023
### Solutions
### Trend 1: Supply Chain Attacks Grow
### Uniform Breach Notice Laws
### Trend 2: Underlying Flaw in Data Breach Notice Laws

The current patchwork of 50 state laws and expanded federal regulations makes compliance difficult and expensive for businesses. Individual victims (as well as businesses vulnerable to a similar attack) increasingly receive no notice or notices with little or no actionable information. The ITRC believes that state data breach laws and federal agency regulations can be more helpful to victims by adopting uniform provisions.

Trillions of U.S. dollars were pumped into the economy in the form of enhanced government cash benefits in 2020 and 2021 to support businesses and individuals during the pandemic. Professional threat actors and their more opportunistic criminal counterparts began to systematically apply for pandemic relief benefits. Identity verification processes used to open and access accounts were no match for the volume or scale of legitimate and illegitimate applications for assistance.

Nearly a dozen states have adopted comprehensive state privacy laws, most of which also include some form of cyber risk assessment. Given the rise in Supply Chain Attacks identified earlier in this report, understanding the risk represented by vendors is imperative. Knowing both the breach history of an organization and being able to verify that history is a key to proper due diligence on current and future suppliers. So is knowing when a vendor or a vendors vendor issues a data breach notice.

The ITRC will soon launch a due diligence and alert tool that allows organizations to comply with state and federal requirements to understand the risks within their supply chains. Known as Breach Alert for Business (BA4B), this service will be available for a low annual fee directly from the ITRC. Submit your interest in BA4B by emailing dorinda@idtheftcenter.org.

As an organization that operates the largest repository of U.S. data breach information, the ITRC immediately recognized that data alone could no longer be trusted as the sole source of truth about a person’s identity in most processes. The ITRC concluded that the expanded use of facial verification and digital credentials is crucial to reducing the number of identity crimes involving the use of stolen personal information.

Facial identity verification is not the same as the controversial facial recognition. The use of a facial biometric as part of a comprehensive identity verification process provides a low-risk, equitable way to help ensure the authenticity of an applicant while lowering the overall value of compromised personally identifiable information to bad actors.

Additionally, given that many legacy identity verification solutions rely on credit data – which does not work well for individuals with little to no credit history – these biometric tools can help reach individuals who might otherwise be excluded from the ability to remotely verify their identity online.

+ Sensitive vs Non-Sensitive Data
+ Actionable vs Non-Actionable Notices

The estimated number of victims impacted represents a 16 percent (16%) reduction from 2022, when more than half of the total annual victim count was related to three breaches announced late in the previous year. This is consistent with a general trend of the number of estimated victims dropping slightly each year. This is a result of organized identity criminals focusing on specific information and identity-related fraud and scams rather than mass attacks.

See Figure 2

Statistical information is slow to develop, but cybersecurity researchers increasingly point to anecdotal evidence of identity criminals pairing stolen personal information with Generative AI tools. The result is highly effective phishing and social engineering attacks that target specific businesses or individuals rather than the traditional phishing lures that were riddled with grammar errors and launched with little knowledge of who was receiving the message.

![Figure 2 | Total Compromises, Year-Over-Year](Figure 2 | Total Compromises, Year-Over-Year)

### Year-Over-Year
The number of data compromises[^2] reported in the U.S. surpassed two significant milestones in 2023: the highest number of data events reported in a single year and exceeding 2,000 (and ultimately 3,000) events in a single year.

[^2]: The ITRC uses the generic term data compromises to describe the various ways personal information is at risk as a result of a cyberattack, system or human error or physical attack. See our Glossary for more information.

### Compromises and Victims
Based on publicly reported compromises, the total number of compromises reflects a trend where most industries saw increases, and a handful saw slight decreases in reported attacks. However, three (3) industries reported more than double the number of compromises compared to 2022: Healthcare, Financial Services and Transportation.

Healthcare led all industries in terms of the number of reported compromises in each of the past five (5) years. However, Utilities companies led in the estimated number of victims in 2023.

See Figure 3

In late 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new rules for public companies regarding the disclosure of material cyber events, including data breaches. In anticipation of the new regulations, the ITRC added a field to identify an entity as a public or private organization. This additional information pointed to some stark contrasts between how publicly traded and other entities respond to data compromises.

![Figure 3 | Compromises by Industry, Year-Over-Year](Figure 3 | Compromises by Industry, Year-Over-Year)

### Sensitive vs Non-Sensitive Data
For example, more than nine percent (9%) of the ~3,700 U.S. publicly traded companies issued a data breach notice in 2023, impacting ~143M victims. The 358 notices from publicly traded companies represented 11 percent (11%) of the overall number of compromises. Yet, public companies accounted for 40 percent (40%) of all data compromise victims. That compares to 2,847 data events at all other organizations impacting ~210M victims during the course of the year.

Analysis of the breach notices also indicated that public companies were more likely to withhold actionable information about their data breach than other entities. Public companies withheld information about an attack in 47 percent (47%) of notices compared to 46 percent (46%) of private companies, government agencies, educational institutions and nonprofit organizations.

See Figure 4

Compromises involving sensitive personal information remained the most common type of breach in 2023. The number of attacks involving only sensitive information dropped by 10 percentage points but increased in absolute terms in 2023 compared to the previous year. That’s because the number of organizations that did not provide information about the nature of the compromised information grew by 3.5x in real terms and doubled in percentage.

See Figure 5

![Figure 4 | Public Compromises & Victims, 2023](Figure 4 | Public Compromises & Victims, 2023)

![Figure 5 | Sensitive vs Non-Sensitive Records, Year-Over-Year](Figure 5 | Sensitive vs Non-Sensitive Records, Year-Over-Year)

As in each of the past five (5) years, the vast majority of data compromises were linked to cyberattacks in 2023. Based on notices that provide information about the root cause of an attack, Phishing-related and ransomware attacks were down slightly, while Malware and Zero Day attacks jumped significantly compared to previous years.

Compromises related to System and Human errors more than tripled in 2023, led by a 590 percent (590%) increase in data being exposed in emails and correspondence. Breaches involving a physical action – loss of a document, device theft, skimming devices – were relatively flat with single-digit increases. Physical breaches are down 65 percent (65%) since 2018.

See Figure 6

![Figure 6 | Attack Vectors, Year-Over-Year](Figure 6 | Attack Vectors, Year-Over-Year)

### Actionable vs Non-Actionable Notices
However, the trend toward opaque breach notices discussed in the 2022 ITRC Data Breach Report accelerated in 2023. The number of breach notices without specific information about the root cause of an attack nearly doubled year-over-year. In the 12 months just ended, more than 1,400 public breach notices did not contain information about an attack vector compared to 716 in 2022 – a 98 percent (98%) increase.

Since 2020, the percentage of notices with actionable information that can help companies and individuals take precautions against cyberattacks has dropped from ~100 percent (100%) to 54 percent (54%).

See Figure 7

![Figure 7 | Actionable vs Non-Actionable Notices, 2023](Figure 7 | Actionable vs Non-Actionable Notices, 2023)

Here are the Top 10 Compromises in 2023. For more information on compromises in 2023 and all compromises of past years, see the Appendix.

The ITRC has been tracking publicly reported data compromises since 2005. You can see the growth in the number of reported breaches as more states adopted mandatory notice laws through 2018. Since then, the growth in compromises has been fueled primarily by cyberattacks.

## Trends
+ Trend 1: Supply Chain Attacks Grow
+ Trend 2: Underlying Flaw in Data Breach Notice Laws

### Trends in 2023
Third-Party Vendor Attacks, also known as Supply Chain Attacks, are typically attacks that fall into one of the primary root causes of a compromise, most often a cyberattack such as a phishing-related attack, ransomware or malware. What makes them unique is the target is not data owned by the breached organization but rather the information of the business’s customers, clients or other vendors in a supply chain.

Rather than attack a single large organization – a large multi-national corporation with a well-resourced cybersecurity program, for example – identity criminals will attack a smaller vendor with less security protections that supports the same large multi-national company along with many other businesses. A supply chain attack can come in the form of breaching a single organization and stealing information from multiple companies or using flaws in a single product or service used by multiple companies to access the personal information stored in their databases.

See Figure 10

![Figure 10 | Supply Chain Attack](Figure 10 | Supply Chain Attack)

### Trend 1: Supply Chain Attacks Grow
Two clear trends emerged in 2023 beyond the dramatic rise in overall data compromises: 1) an equally dramatic increase in the number of organizations being impacted by Supply Chain Attacks, and 2) a trend highlighted by the rise in Supply Chain Attacks – the further breakdown in the breach notification framework.

Attackers bypass large organization’s cybersecurity & data protections by attacking smaller vendors to access larger company’s information, their customers, and other vendors.

While Supply Chain Attacks had been around for many years, the ability to automate and launch the attacks at scale accelerated in 2018. That year, an attack on third parties might impact the company attacked and a handful of other organizations.

Fast forward to today, and the MOVEit attack shows the scope and scale a Supply Chain Attack can have. For instance, 102 entities were directly impacted by threat actors exploiting a MOVEit product. However, 1,271 organizations were indirectly affected when information stored in or accessed by a MOVEit product or service was compromised via a vendor or vendors.

See Figure 12

Some organizations (25) reported being impacted by multiple vendors that used MOVEit product; more than a dozen (13) organizations reported that a vendor of a vendor experienced the breach. The entire databases of the state motor vehicle agencies in Louisiana and Oregon were compromised, exposing information that can be used to impersonate current or former residents of those states.

While the growth in the number of organizations targeted in Supply Chain Attacks has been relatively slow since 2018, the number of organizations impacted has surged by more than 2,600 percent (2,600%) over the same time period. The estimated number of victims has also surged to more than 54M victims, or 15 percent (15%) of the overall number of victims in 2023.

See Figure 11

The chart illustrating the growth in Supply Chain Attacks includes organizations impacted by one of the largest third-party vendor attacks ever – a 2023 attack against the company that offers the MOVEit file transfer software and service. Cybercriminals exploited previously unknown flaws in software and cloud versions of MOVEit used by businesses, governments, schools, hospitals and other organizations around the world to securely share documents and information.

![Figure 12 | MOVEit Supply Chain Attack, Direct and Indirect Impacts](Figure 12 | MOVEit Supply Chain Attack, Direct and Indirect Impacts)

### Trend 2: Underlying Flaw in Data Breach Notice Laws
The ITRC first identified a significant drop in the number of data breach notices with a distinct lack of actionable information in late 2021.

As noted elsewhere in this report, the opaque nature of data breach notices continued to increase during the past year at a time when the overall volume of public breach notices has grown. This lack of transparency puts businesses and individuals at increased risk of their identities being misused.

Since the earliest days of state breach notice laws, advocates for and against mandatory notices debated if breach laws would be a deterrent to lax policies and protections, and if absent strong penalty provisions, organizations would issue notices at all. For the most part, the organization that is attacked makes the decision if a breach notice is required based on their determination of risk to the data subject. If the organization determines there is no risk of harm to an individual, then no notice is required[^3].

[^3]: Oregon, for example, is an exception to the self-determination of risk after a data breach. An organization may consult with law enforcement agencies to make a joint determination if a notice to victims is required

The rise in Supply Chain Attacks where the breached entity may not own the data that is stolen has called into question who is responsible for making the determination of risk and notifying victims of the compromise. The 2020 Supply Chain Attack against Blackbaud illustrates the issues surrounding notification and highlights the fact breaches are under-reported.

In May 2020, Blackbaud, a publicly traded cloud computing provider that serves nonprofit, education, healthcare and other institutional clients, was the target of a cyberattack. The information of roughly one-quarter of the company’s customers was compromised and held for ransom. According to a settlement agreement reached in late 2023 with 49 state attorneys general, Blackbaud notified more than 13,000 customers about the data breach and the loss of their data but did not notify the individual victims whose personal information was exposed.

Of the 13,000 Blackbaud customers impacted by the breach, only 604 organizations filed public notices tracked by the ITRC, representing an estimated 12.8M victims. The gap between the thousands of organizations that lost data and the hundreds who notified victims is a clear indicator that data breach notice laws and regulations have failed to achieve the original goal of protecting businesses and individuals.
