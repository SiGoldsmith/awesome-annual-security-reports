A Letter from the CEO

On July 1, 2003, the world’s first 
law that required consumers to 
be notified their personal 
information had been 
compromised in a data breach 
went into effect in California. 
The law only applied to 
residents of the Golden State 
and it was primarily aimed at 
the risk of the time – the 
exposure of personal 
information stored in filing 
cabinets and on disks and 
drives. Dumpster diving and 
stolen laptops were the top 
sources of breaches.

While many businesses were aware of the new 
law and the need to inform California residents 
of a loss of their personally identifiable 
information (PII), most consumers were not. 
Especially outside California.

That all changed in 2005 when a Georgia\-based 
company sent letters to a small group of 
California consumers alerting them that their 
PII had been obtained by a group of organized 
criminals posing as legitimate businesses. On 
Valentine’s Day, “Data Breach Notice” appeared 
in the popular lexicon for the first time.

That original notice not only generated intense 
interest in California, but around the world. 

Major media outlets in the U.S. and Europe 
covered the story each day for 30 days and 
Congress held a series of hearings on the topic 
of data breaches. Soon, consumers outside 
California were informed they, too, may have 
been the victim of the data breach in 
recognition that criminals and data did not 
recognize state lines.

By the end of 2005, 156 other organizations had 
issued breach notices tracked by the ITRC and 
a handful of states adopted a California\-style 
breach notice law. Fast forward to 2018 when 
the final two states adopted breach notice 
requirements, following the lead of 90 other 
countries, all U.S. territories, and the District of 
Columbia. 

However, Congress did not enact a federal 
breach notice law. Even in the wake of a single 
2017 data breach linked to a Nation/State that 
compromised the personal information of nearly 
every adult in the U.S. and millions of adults in 
other countries. The result was a patchwork of 
state laws and federal regulations with different 
definitions of PII, triggers for a notice, methods 
of notification, time frames for issuing a notice, 
and penalties for failing to issue a notice.

In the years between 2005 and 2018, 
technology advanced and identity criminals’ 
skills improved. Paper documents in file cabinets 
accessible in locked rooms were replaced by 
cloud environments accessible via the internet. 
Identity criminals shifted from lone individuals 
hacking for fun and street cred in their parents’ 
basement to highly sophisticated groups 
operating out of glass and stone towers in 
far\-away lands. Hollywood shows us people in 
hoodies while the real identity criminals flash 
cash, drive Lambos and operate call centers.

Off\-the\-shelf hacker tools lowered the barrier 
to entry for launching attacks and the wealth 
of personal information available from data 
breaches and identity scams made it easy to 
impersonate an individual or business using 
social engineering. This was the environment in 
2021 that created the highest number of data 
compromises ever tracked by the ITRC – 1,8601 
events impacted an estimated \~300M victims.

The highest, that is, until 2023\.

In the pages that follow you’ll see the new 
record high: 3,205 publicly reported data 
compromises that impacted an estimated 
353,027,892 individuals. That’s a 72 percent 
(72%) increase in events over the previous 
high\-water mark and 78 percent (78%) over 
2022\.

Compromises

Each year we are asked “why the increase in 
events?” and “what can be done to protect 
against a data breach?” There’s never any one 
reason why compromises go up or down just as 
there are no actions that are 100 percent 
effective in stopping breaches or the identity 
crimes that result. We do believe there are 
trends that need to be highlighted and actions 
that need to be considered if we are to slow or 
stop the pace of data breaches and exposures.

First, we must acknowledge the significant 
impact of Supply Chain Attacks and the effect 
they have on all organizations. A single supply 
chain attack can directly or indirectly impact 
hundreds or thousands of businesses that rely on 
the same vendor. Stronger reporting 
requirements can help warn other vulnerable 
businesses of the risk associated with a similar 
attack. Increased due diligence when it comes to 
vendors and data protection are also in order.

Second, the two\-decade old legislative and 
regulatory framework designed to alert 
consumers to breaches is broken. A Supply Chain 
Attack victim from 2020 confirmed in 2023 what 
was suspected for years: Businesses under or 
non\-report breaches. We need to bring a level of 
uniformity to the breach notice process to help 
protect both consumers and business.

The sheer scale of the 2023 data compromises 
is overwhelming. Just the increase from the past 
record high to 2023’s number is larger than the 
annual number of events from 2005 until 2020 
(except for 2017\). But, we cannot let 
complacency, frustration, or weariness lead us 
to surrender the fight to protect identity crime 
victims. We’re not about to give\-up or give\-in and 
we hope you will join us as we seek to start a 
different conversation about protecting 
identities in 2024\.

1Audits of 2021 and 2022 compromises resulted in a reduction in the total number of data compromises for those years due to breaches originally reported as separate 
events later being updated as related events. The total number of compromises in full\-year 2021 has been adjusted downward by two (2\) events to 1,860 and full\-year 
2022 adjusted downward by one (1\) event to 1,801\.

Data Leak – When personal information 
that is publicly available or willingly shared 
on social media and represents no or low 
risk when viewed as individual records; 
however, when aggregated, the sheer
volume of personal information available in 
a single database creates risk to the data
subjects and value for identity criminals 
who specialize in social engineering and 
phishing. When these databases are left 
unprotected or otherwise made publicly 
available, the ITRC classifies these events 
as Data Leaks.

Identity Crimes – The overall term for a 
wide variety of state and federal criminal 
acts that are related to the theft and/or 
misuse of personal information.

Identity Theft – Taking personally
identifiable information (PII) as protected 
by state or federal laws.

Identity Fraud – Using stolen personally 
identifiable information (PII).

Glossary of Terms

One of the issues that leads to confusion around 
data compromises is the fact there is no single 
definition or set of terms used to describe a 
data breach that requires a notice in the U.S. 
Since data breach notices are largely creatures 
of state law, there are as many definitions and 
trigger events as there are states, territories 
and federal districts. Adding to the confusion, 
Federal government agencies also have their 
own set of terms and requirements for issuing a 
data breach notice, many of which have recently 
changed or are in the process of changing. (See 
SEC, FTC and FCC rule changes announced in 
2023\.)

Since 2020, the ITRC has published the 
definitions we use in compiling and publishing 
this report. We have updated our terms for the 
2023 report.

Data Compromise – The overall term used 
to refer to events where personal
information is accessible by unauthorized 
individuals and/or for unintended
purposes. This includes data breaches, data 
exposures, and data leaks.

Data Breach – When unauthorized
individuals access and/or remove
personal information from the place where 
is it stored.

Data Exposure – When personal
information is available for access and/or 
removal from the place where it is stored, 
but there is no evidence the information 
has been accessed by unauthorized 
individuals. This typically involves 
cloud\-based data storage where 
cybersecurity protections are incorrectly 
configured or have not been applied.

Executive Summary

Analysis – 2023 vs 2022

The number of data compromises reported in 
the United States surpassed two significant 
milestones in 2023: the highest number of data 
events reported in a single year and exceeding 
2,000 (and ultimately 3,000\) events in a single 
year. The total number of data breaches, 
exposures, leaks and unspecified events reached 
3,205, impacting an estimated 353,027,892 
victims, including those affected by multiple 
compromises. The 2023 compromises represent 
a 78 percentage point increase over the 
previous year and a 72 percentage point hike 
from the previous all\-time high number of 
compromises (1,860\) set in 2021\. 

The estimated number of victims impacted 
represents a 16 percentage point reduction 
from 2022, when more than half of the total 
annual victim count was related to three 
breaches announced late in the previous year. 
This is consistent with a general trend of the 
number of estimated victims dropping slightly 
each year. This is a result of organized identity 
criminals focusing on specific information and 
identity\-related fraud and scams rather than 
mass attacks. 

Based on publicly reported compromises, the 
total number of compromises reflects a trend 
where most industries saw increases, and a 
handful saw slight decreases in reported 
attacks. However, three (3\) industries reported 
more than double the number of compromises 
compared to 2022: Healthcare, Financial 
Services and Transportation. 

Healthcare led all industries in terms of the 
number of reported compromises in each of the 
past five (5\) years, but Utilities companies led in 
the estimated number of victims in 2023\.

More than nine percent (9%) of the \~3,700 U.S. 
publicly traded companies issued a data breach 
notice in 2023, impacting \~143M victims. The 
358 notices from publicly traded companies 
represented 11 percent (11%) of the overall 
number of compromises. Yet, public companies 
accounted for 40 percent (40%) of all data 
compromise victims. That compares to 2,847 
data events at all other organizations, impacting 
\~210M victims during the course of the year.

Analysis of the breach notices also indicated 
that public companies were more likely to 
withhold actionable information about their 
data breach than other entities. Publicly 
traded companies withheld information about 
an attack in 47 percent (47%) of notices 
compared to 46 percent (46%) of private 
companies, government agencies, education 
institutions and nonprofit organizations. 

As in each of the past five (5\) years, the vast 
majority of data compromises were linked to 
cyberattacks in 2023\. Phishing\-related and 
ransomware attacks were down slightly, while 
malware and Zero Day attacks jumped 
significantly compared to previous years.

Compromises related to System and Human 
errors more than tripled in 2023, led by a 
590 percent (590%) increase in data being 
exposed in emails and correspondence. 
Breaches involving a physical action – loss of a 
document, device theft, skimming devices – 
were relatively flat with single\-digit increases. 
Physical breaches are down 65 percent (65%) 
since 2018\.

The trend toward opaque breach notices 
discussed in the 2022 ITRC Data Breach Report 
accelerated in 2023\. The number of breach 
notices without specific information about the 
root cause of an attack nearly doubled 
year\-over\-year. In the 12 months that just 
ended, more than 1,400 public breach notices 
did not contain information about an attack 
vector compared to 716 in 2022 – a 
98 percentage point increase.

Trends in 2023

Two clear trends emerged in 2023 beyond the 
dramatic rise in overall data compromises: 
1\) an equally dramatic increase in the number of 
organizations being impacted by Supply Chain 
Attacks, and 2\) a trend highlighted by the rise in 
Supply Chain Attacks – the further break\-down 
in the breach notification framework.

Trend 1: Supply Chain Attacks Grow

While the growth in the number of 
organizations targeted in Supply Chain Attacks 
has been relatively slow since 2018, the number 
of organizations impacted has surged by more 
than 2,600 percent (2,600%) over the same 
time period. The estimated number of victims 
has also surged to more than 54M victims, or 
15 percent (15%) of the overall number of 
victims in 2023\.

Trend 2: Underlying Flaw in Data 
Breach Notice Laws

The rise in Supply Chain Attacks where the 
breached entity may not own the data that is 
stolen has called into question who is 
responsible for making the determination of risk 
and notifying victims of the compromise. The 
2020 Supply Chain Attack against Blackbaud 
illustrates the issues surrounding notification 
and highlights the fact breaches are 
under\-reported.

According to a settlement agreement reached 
in late 2023 with 49 state attorneys general, 
Blackbaud notified more than 13,000 customers 
about the data breach and the loss of their data 
but did not notify the individual victims whose 
personal information was exposed.

Of the 13,000 Blackbaud customers impacted 
by the breach, only 604 organizations filed 
public notices tracked by the ITRC, representing 
an estimated 12\.8M victims. The gap between 
the thousands of organizations that lost data 
and the hundreds who notified victims is a clear 
indicator that data breach notice laws and 
regulations have failed to achieve the original 
goal of protecting businesses and individuals. 

Solutions

The combination of more data from more 
compromises, along with revolutionary 
technology, means we must consider significant 
changes to how we protect personal 
information and respond when it is 
compromised. There are three areas where the 
ITRC suggests action that will help reduce the 
rate and impact of data breaches on individual 
and business victims.

Uniform Breach Notice Laws

In the 20 years since California’s first\-of\-its\-kind 
data breach notice law went into effect, nearly 
19,000 data breaches have been publicly 
reported in the United States. In the U.S., there 
were an average of \~12 (12\.3\) data breaches 
reported each business day in 2023, while in 
the European Union, there were an average of 
912 compromises reported each business day in 
2022; the last year data was available.

Additionally, given that many legacy identity 
verification solutions rely on credit data – which 
does not work well for individuals with little to 
no credit history – these biometric tools can 
help reach individuals who might otherwise 
be excluded from the ability to remotely verify 
their identity online. 

Improve Vendor Due Diligence

Nearly a dozen states have adopted 
comprehensive state privacy laws, most of 
which also include some form of cyber risk 
assessment. Given the rise in Supply Chain 
Attacks identified earlier in this report, 
understanding the risk represented by vendors 
is imperative. Knowing both the breach history 
of an organization and being able to verify that 
history is a key to proper due diligence on 
current and future suppliers. So is knowing 
when a vendor or a vendors vendor issues a data 
breach notice.

The ITRC will soon launch a due diligence and 
alert tool that allows organizations to comply 
with state and federal requirements to 
understand the risks within their supply chains. 
Known as Breach Alert for Business (BA4B), 
this service will be available for a low annual fee 
directly from the ITRC. Submit your interest in 
BA4B by emailing dorinda@idtheftcenter.org.

The current patchwork of 50 state laws and 
expanded federal regulations makes compliance 
difficult and expensive for businesses. Individual 
victims (as well as businesses vulnerable to a 
similar attack) increasingly receive no notice or 
notices with little or no actionable information. 

The ITRC believes that state data breach laws 
and federal agency regulations can be more 
helpful to victims by adopting uniform 
provisions. 

Digital Credentials \& Facial 
Comparison Systems

Trillions of U.S. dollars were pumped into the 
economy in the form of enhanced government 
cash benefits in 2020 and 2021 to support 
businesses and individuals during the pandemic. 
Professional threat actors and their more 
opportunistic criminal counterparts began to 
systematically apply for pandemic relief 
benefits. Identity verification processes used to 
open and access accounts were no match for the 
volume or scale of legitimate and illegitimate 
applications for assistance. 

As an organization that operates the largest 
repository of U.S. data breach information, 
the ITRC immediately recognized that data 
alone could no longer be trusted as the sole 
source of truth about a person’s identity in most 
processes. The ITRC concluded that the 
expanded use of facial verification and digital 
credentials is crucial to reducing the number of 
identity crimes involving the use of stolen 
personal information.

Facial identity verification is not the same as 
the controversial facial recognition. The use of 
a facial biometric as part of a comprehensive 
identity verification process provides a low\-risk, 
equitable way to help ensure the authenticity of 
an applicant while lowering the overall value of 
compromised personally identifiable 
information to bad actors.

2023 Analysis

The number of data compromises2 
reported in the U.S. surpassed two 
significant milestones in 2023: the 
highest number of data events reported 
in a single year and exceeding 2,000 (and 
ultimately 3,000\) events in a single year.

Year\-Over\-Year

Compromises and Victims

The estimated number of victims impacted represents a 
16 percent (16%) reduction from 2022, when more than half 
of the total annual victim count was related to three breaches 
announced late in the previous year. This is consistent with 
a general trend of the number of estimated victims dropping 
slightly each year. This is a result of organized identity 
criminals focusing on specific information and identity\-related 
fraud and scams rather than mass attacks.
See Figure 2

Statistical information is slow to develop, but cybersecurity 
researchers increasingly point to anecdotal evidence of 
identity criminals pairing stolen personal information with 
Generative AI tools. The result is highly effective phishing and 
social engineering attacks that target specific businesses or 
individuals rather than the traditional phishing lures that were 
riddled with grammar errors and launched with little 
knowledge of who was receiving the message.

Based on publicly reported compromises, the total number 
of compromises reflects a trend where most industries saw 
increases, and a handful saw slight decreases in reported 
attacks. However, three (3\) industries reported more than 
double the number of compromises compared to 2022: 
Healthcare, Financial Services and Transportation.

Healthcare led all industries in terms of the number of 
reported compromises in each of the past five (5\) years. 
However, Utilities companies led in the estimated number of 
victims in 2023\.
See Figure 3

Sensitive vs Non\-Sensitive Data

In late 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
adopted new rules for public companies regarding the 
disclosure of material cyber events, including data breaches. 
In anticipation of the new regulations, the ITRC added a field 
to identify an entity as a public or private organization. This 
additional information pointed to some stark contrasts 
between how publicly traded and other entities respond to 
data compromises.

For example, more than nine percent (9%) of the \~3,700 U.S. 
publicly traded companies issued a data breach notice in 
2023, impacting \~143M victims. The 358 notices from 
publicly traded companies represented 11 percent (11%) of 
the overall number of compromises. Yet, public companies 
accounted for 40 percent (40%) of all data compromise 
victims. That compares to 2,847 data events at all other 
organizations impacting \~210M victims during the course of 
the year. 

Analysis of the breach notices also indicated that public 
companies were more likely to withhold actionable 
information about their data breach than other entities. Public 
companies withheld information about an attack in 47 percent 
(47%) of notices compared to 46 percent (46%) of private 
companies, government agencies, educational institutions and 
nonprofit organizations. 
See Figure 4

Compromises involving sensitive personal information 
remained the most common type of breach in 2023\. The 
number of attacks involving only sensitive information 
dropped by 10 percentage points but increased in absolute 
terms in 2023 compared to the previous year. That’s because 
the number of organizations that did not provide information 
about the nature of the compromised information grew by 
3\.5x in real terms and doubled in percentage.

Actionable vs Non\-Actionable Notices

As in each of the past five (5\) years, the vast majority of data 
compromises were linked to cyberattacks in 2023\. Based on 
notices that provide information about the root cause of an 
attack, Phishing\-related and ransomware attacks were down 
slightly, while Malware and Zero Day attacks jumped 
significantly compared to previous years.

Compromises related to System and Human errors more 
than tripled in 2023, led by a 590 percent (590%) increase in 
data being exposed in emails and correspondence. Breaches 
involving a physical action – loss of a document, device theft, 
skimming devices – were relatively flat with single\-digit 
increases. Physical breaches are down 65 percent (65%) 
since 2018\.
See Figure 6

However, the trend toward opaque breach notices discussed 
in the 2022 ITRC Data Breach Report accelerated in 2023\. 
The number of breach notices without specific information 
about the root cause of an attack nearly doubled 
year\-over\-year. In the 12 months just ended, more than 1,400 
public breach notices did not contain information about an 
attack vector compared to 716 in 2022 – a 98 percent (98%) 
increase.

Since 2020, the percentage of notices with actionable 
information that can help companies and individuals take 
precautions against cyberattacks has dropped from 
\~100 percent (100%) to 54 percent (54%).

past years, see the Appendix.

Total Annual Compromises Since 2005

The ITRC has been tracking publicly reported data 
compromises since 2005\. You can see the growth in the 
number of reported breaches as more states adopted 
mandatory notice laws through 2018\. Since then, the growth 
in compromises has been fueled primarily by cyberattacks.

Trends

\+ Trend 1: Supply Chain Attacks Grow

\+ Trend 2: Underlying Flaw in Data Breach Notice Laws

© IDENTITY THEFT RESOURCE CEN TER 2024 \| IDTHEFTCENTER.ORG

14

Trends in 2023

Two clear trends emerged in 2023 
beyond the dramatic rise in overall data 
compromises: 1\) an equally dramatic 
increase in the number of organizations 
being impacted by Supply Chain Attacks, 
and 2\) a trend highlighted by the rise 
in Supply Chain Attacks – the further 
breakdown in the breach notification 
framework.

Trend 1: Supply Chain Attacks Grow

Third\-Party Vendor Attacks, also known as Supply Chain 
Attacks, are typically attacks that fall into one of the primary 
root causes of a compromise, most often a cyberattack such 
as a phishing\-related attack, ransomware or malware. What 
makes them unique is the target is not data owned by the 
breached organization but rather the information of the 
business’s customers, clients or other vendors in a supply 
chain.

Rather than attack a single large organization – a large 
multi\-national corporation with a well\-resourced 
cybersecurity program, for example – identity criminals will 
attack a smaller vendor with less security protections that 
supports the same large multi\-national company along with 
many other businesses. A supply chain attack can come in the 
form of breaching a single organization and stealing 
information from multiple companies or using flaws in a single 
product or service used by multiple companies to access the 
personal information stored in their databases.
See Figure 10

Figure 10 \| Supply Chain Attack

How a Supply Chain 
Attack Works
Attackers bypass large organization’s 
cybersecurity \& data protections by 
attacking smaller vendors to access larger 
company’s information, their customers,

Entities Impacted

While the growth in the number of organizations targeted in 
Supply Chain Attacks has been relatively slow since 2018, the 
number of organizations impacted has surged by more than 
2,600 percent (2,600%) over the same time period. The 
estimated number of victims has also surged to more than 
54M victims, or 15 percent (15%) of the overall number of 
victims in 2023\.
See Figure 11

The chart illustrating the growth in Supply Chain Attacks 
includes organizations impacted by one of the largest 
third\-party vendor attacks ever – a 2023 attack against the 
company that offers the MOVEit file transfer software and 
service. Cybercriminals exploited previously unknown flaws 
in software and cloud versions of MOVEit used by businesses, 
governments, schools, hospitals and other organizations around 
the world to securely share documents and information.

While Supply Chain Attacks had been around for many years, 
the ability to automate and launch the attacks at scale 
accelerated in 2018\. That year, an attack on third parties might 
impact the company attacked and a handful of other 
organizations.

Fast forward to today, and the MOVEit attack shows the scope 
and scale a Supply Chain Attack can have. For instance, 102 
entities were directly impacted by threat actors exploiting a 
MOVEit product. However, 1,271 organizations were indirectly 
affected when information stored in or accessed by a MOVEit 
product or service was compromised via a vendor or vendors.
See Figure 12

Some organizations (25\) reported being impacted by multiple 
vendors that used MOVEit product; more than a dozen (13\) 
organizations reported that a vendor of a vendor experienced 
the breach. The entire databases of the state motor vehicle 
agencies in Louisiana and Oregon were compromised, exposing 
information that can be used to impersonate current or former 
residents of those states.

Trend 2: Underlying Flaw in Data Breach 
Notice Laws

The ITRC first identified a significant drop in the number of 
data breach notices with a distinct lack of actionable 
information in late 2021\.

© IDENTITY THEFT RESOURCE CEN TER 2024 \| IDTHEFTCENTER.ORG

16

 
As noted elsewhere in this report, the opaque nature of data 
breach notices continued to increase during the past year at 
a time when the overall volume of public breach notices has 
grown. This lack of transparency puts businesses and 
individuals at increased risk of their identities being misused.

Since the earliest days of state breach notice laws, advocates 
for and against mandatory notices debated if breach laws 
would be a deterrent to lax policies and protections, and if 
absent strong penalty provisions, organizations would issue 
notices at all. For the most part, the organization that is 
attacked makes the decision if a breach notice is required 
based on their determination of risk to the data subject. If the 
organization determines there is no risk of harm to an 
individual, then no notice is required3\.

The rise in Supply Chain Attacks where the breached entity 
may not own the data that is stolen has called into question 
who is responsible for making the determination of risk and 
notifying victims of the compromise. The 2020 Supply Chain 
Attack against Blackbaud illustrates the issues surrounding 
notification and highlights the fact breaches are 
under\-reported.

In May 2020, Blackbaud, a publicly traded cloud computing 
provider that serves nonprofit, education, healthcare and other 
institutional clients, was the target of a cyberattack. The 
information of roughly one\-quarter of the company’s customers 
was compromised and held for ransom. According to a 
settlement agreement reached in late 2023 with 49 state 
attorneys general, Blackbaud notified more than 13,000 
customers about the data breach and the loss of their data but 
did not notify the individual victims whose personal information 
was exposed.

Of the 13,000 Blackbaud customers impacted by the breach, 
only 604 organizations filed public notices tracked by the ITRC, 
representing an estimated 12\.8M victims. The gap between the 
thousands of organizations that lost data and the hundreds 
who notified victims is a clear indicator that data breach notice 
laws and regulations have failed to achieve the original goal of 
protecting businesses and individuals.

Solutions

At the end of 2023, the ITRC 
issued predictions for 2024, 
including this:

An unprecedented number of data 
breaches in 2023 by financially 
motivated and Nation/State 
threat actors will drive new levels 
of identity crimes in 2024, 
especially impersonation and 
synthetic identity fraud.

It’s a safe bet, too, that Generative AI will also 
contribute to a rise in the sophistication of 
phishing attacks and other forms of identity 
fraud and scams using personal information 
stolen in data breaches. The availability of 
compromised consumer data and the use of 
large language models (LLMs) is already 
resulting in vastly improved phishing lures and 
highly effective social engineering attacks that 
are driving financial losses for businesses and 
individuals. Still, the greatest risk from 
Generative AI will continue to be mis\- and 
dis\-information because of the ease of 
automating and scaling the distribution of false 
information, not voice cloning or deep fake 
videos used to extort victims.

The combination of more data from more 
compromises, along with revolutionary 
technology, means we must consider significant 
changes to how we protect personal 
information and respond when it is 
compromised. There are three areas where the 
ITRC suggests action that will help reduce the 
rate and impact of data breaches on individual 
and business victims.

Uniform Breach Notice Laws

In the 20 years since California’s first\-of\-its\-kind 
data breach notice law went into effect, nearly 
19,000 data breaches have been publicly 
reported in the U.S. In the U.S., there were an 
average of \~12 (12\.3\) data breaches reported 
each business day in 2023, while in the 
European Union, there were an average of 
912 compromises reported each business day 
in 2022, the last year data was available.

The current patchwork of 50 state laws and 
expanded federal regulations makes 
compliance difficult and expensive for 
businesses. Individual victims (as well as 
businesses vulnerable to a similar attack) 
increasingly receive no notice or notices with 
little or no actionable information. There is wide 
variability in what triggers a breach notice, how 
a notice is to be sent, the content of the notice, 
the time frame in which the notice must be sent 
and penalties for non\-compliance.

© IDENTITY THEFT RESOURCE CEN TER 2024 \| IDTHEFTCENTER.ORG

19

The ITRC believes state data breach laws and 
federal agency regulations can be more helpful 
to victims by adopting uniform provisions. 
For example:

 \+ Entities found to have violated the 

provisions of the uniform Act should be 
fined an amount for each day a violation 
occurs.

 \+ A uniform definition of personally 

identifiable information that triggers a 
notice.

 \+ Breach notices should be filed with state 

and federal agencies of jurisdiction 
within 24 hours of any data breach. 

 \+ Together, breached entities and 

government agencies should determine 
if there is potential harm to an individual 
based on the information that has been 
compromised. If so, the breached entity 
should notify impacted individuals within 
72 hours of the initial notice to the 
government of the breach. 

 \+ In the event the release of information 

regarding the data breach is determined 
to be a threat to national security or of 
terrorism, the senior state agency official, 
in consultation with the U.S. government 
agencies of jurisdiction, may delay 
notification for no more than 30 days.

 \+ Notices should include detailed 

information about the organization and 
the event. Entities should be granted safe 
harbor from liability for data breaches, if:

 \+ An entity fully complies with the 

uniform Act, and;

 \+ Provides notice to the Identity 
Theft Resource Center for 
publication in the ITRC’s database 
of breach notifications for free 
public access to the information

 \+ Safe Harbor should not be granted in the 

event of gross negligence or willful 
misconduct leading to a data 
compromise. Willful misconduct includes 
failing to fully fund a data security 
program equal to the risk of harm.

Digital Credentials \& Facial 
Comparison Systems

In November 2023, the ITRC completed a 
year\-long review of emerging methods of 
identity verification, a key to protecting 
individuals from identity crimes. Trillions of U.S. 
dollars were pumped into the economy in the 
form of enhanced government cash benefits in 
2020 and 2021 to support businesses and 
individuals during the pandemic. Professional 
threat actors and their more opportunistic 
criminal counterparts began to 
systematically apply for pandemic relief 
benefits. Identity verification processes used to 
open and access accounts were no match for the 
volume or scale of legitimate and illegitimate 
applications for assistance. 

As an organization that operates the largest 
repository of U.S. data breach information, the 
ITRC immediately recognized that data alone 
could no longer be trusted as the sole source of 
truth about a person’s identity in most 
processes. The ITRC concluded that the 
expanded use of facial verification and digital 
credentials is crucial to reducing the number of 
identity crimes involving the use of stolen 
personal information.

© IDENTITY THEFT RESOURCE CEN TER 2024 \| IDTHEFTCENTER.ORG

20

Increasing adoption of mobile Driver’s Licenses 
(mDL) also represents an opportunity to reduce 
the value of stolen personal information and 
increase the security of personal credentials. 
Having a standards\-based mobile form of digital 
identity that offers the same trust as a 
state\-issued physical driver’s license could be 
the on ramp to a secure, uniform, consent\-based 
and fraud\-resistant identity proofing solutions. 
A digital credential can be verified with the 
issuing agency in real\-time to ensure the 
authenticity of the mDL and the identity of the 
holder, making stolen information far less 
valuable and useful. 

Improve Vendor Due Diligence

Nearly a dozen states have adopted 
comprehensive state privacy laws, most of 
which also include some form of cyber risk 
assessment. Various state and federal 
regulatory agencies have also adopted a model 
of requiring organizations to have cybersecurity 
protections in place that are “equal to the risk” 
of harm to individuals if their information were 
compromised in a data breach. 

Some states, California and New York for 
example, have proscribed that an 
equal\-to\-the\-risk approach includes ensuring 
vendors (and even vendors’ vendors) must have 
data and security protections in place that meet 
or exceed the prime organization’s criteria. 
Regular audits are required as part of the 
compliance regime. New York requires the 
prime organization to issue a data breach 
notice even if the breach occurs at an affiliate 
or vendor.

Traditional ID verification is often based on two 
factors; “something you know,” like your SSN, or 
“something you have,” such as a driver’s license, 
smartphone, or security token. Adding a third 
factor – “something you are” \- introduces a 
biometric which most adults already have (a 
photo) on file with government agencies thanks 
to the process they went through to get a 
driver’s license or passport. If someone can 
prove that their face matches the photo on their 
government ID, it provides a strong signal that 
they are the rightful owner of that document. 

Facial identity verification is not the same as the 
controversial facial recognition. The confusion 
between the two very different uses of facial 
biometrics threatens the adoption and 
implementation of beneficial uses of facial 
verification. 

 \+ Facial verification \- also known in some 
circles as “facial comparison” – begins 
with a consent\-based transaction that 
requires a person to prove they are who 
they claim to be. In the most robust 
processes that exist today, a live photo or 
selfie photo is compared to the photo on 
a credential that someone already has, 
like a driver’s license. 

 \+ Facial recognition is used by law 

enforcement and intelligence agencies to 
capture a person’s face that is then 
compared to a file that may contain 
thousands to millions of other individuals 
as part of surveillance or an investigation. 

The use of a facial biometric as part of a 
comprehensive identity verification process 
provides a low\-risk, equitable way to help 
ensure the authenticity of an applicant while 
lowering the overall value of compromised 
personally identifiable information to bad 
actors. Additionally, given that many legacy 
identity verification solutions rely on credit 
data – which does not work well for individuals 
with little to no credit history – these biometric 
tools can help reach individuals who might 
otherwise be excluded from the ability to 
remotely verify their identity online.

Given the rise in Supply Chain Attacks identified 
earlier in this report, understanding the risk 
represented by vendors is imperative. Knowing 
both the breach history of an organization and 
being able to verify that history is a key to 
proper due diligence on current and future 
suppliers. So is knowing when a vendor or a 
vendors vendor issues a data breach notice.

Breach Alert for Business

The ITRC will soon launch a due diligence and 
alert tool that allows organizations to comply 
with state and federal requirements to 
understand the risks within their supply chains. 
Known as Breach Alert for Business (BA4B), 
this service will be available for a low annual fee 
directly from the ITRC.

Submit your interest in BA4B

Data Map

The ITRC database of publicly reported data 
breaches includes a comprehensive set of data 
points described in the following data map. 
This information feeds our data breach tracking 
and alert tools that are available for free to 
consumers and for a fee to businesses under the 
notified brand name.

Data Breach – Data removed by malicious action 
or error from the database or system where it 
was created, collected, processed, or 
maintained. NIST definition: The unauthorized 
transfer of information from an information 
system.

Data Exposure – Data that was available for 
viewing or download where data was NOT 
removed (exfiltrated) from the database or 
system where it was created, collected, 
processed, or maintained. Example: a Cloud 
database where data was open to the internet 
but where there is no evidence the data was 
removed.

Data Compromise/Data Event – Generic terms 
for a data breach or data exposures.

Breach Number – Salesforce unique assigned 
value.

Date Breach orExposure Reported – Date a data 
event was reported by a compromised 
organization, government agency, or media.

Entity Name – Name of a compromised 
organization.

State – State where a compromised organization 
is headquartered or where a compromise 
occurred.

Individuals Impacted – Number of individuals 
impacted by the breach/exposure.

Sector– Standard categories used to filter data 
compromises by organization type/sector and 
industry (based on SIC code).

Publicly Traded – Indicates if a company is 
publicly traded.

Total Records Breached or Exposed – Total 
records compromised linked to a single 
individual.

Sensitive Records Exposed – Y/N \- Records 
compromised contain sensitive personal 
identifiable information (SPII) as defined by 
statute, such as passport numbers, SSN, health 
information, etc.

Nonensitive Records Exposed – Y/N \- Records 
compromised only contain non\-sensitive 
personal information (PII) as defined by statute, 
such as telephone numbers, email addresses, 
login \& passwords, etc.

Unknown Records Exposed – Y/N \- Type of 
records compromised are unknown.

Threat Actor – A threat actor is the person or 
group whose actions or failure to act results 
in a data compromise. The act or failure to act 
may be malicious or it may be an error. Internal 
actors are employees of a compromised 
organization. An external actor may be an 
independent person or group as well as an 
affiliated 3rd party such as a vendor. A Nation/
State actor is acting on behalf of a government.

© IDENTITY THEFT RESOURCE CEN TER 2024 \| IDTHEFTCENTER.ORG

38

Attack Vector – The category of method used by 
a threat actor to compromise an organization’s 
data. Cyberattacks involve compromising an 
electronic information system using software or 
computer technology. Physical attacks involve 
compromising data through a physical act. 
System or Human Errors are failures of a 
system or human being to perform as expected 
or required without malicious intent that results 
in a data compromise.

Last Modified Date – Last date information 
about a compromise was updated in the ITRC 
database.

Breach Info Source – Source of information about

Methodology

For purposes of quarterly and annual reporting, the ITRC aggregates data events based on the date the 
breach, exposure, or leak was entered into the database rather than the date the event occurred. This 
avoids the confusion and data conflicts associated with the need to routinely update previous reports 
and compromise totals. The date of the original compromise, if known, and the date of the event report 
are noted in the ITRC’s notified data compromise tracking database.

The number of victims linked to individual compromises are updated as needed and can be accessed in 
the ITRC’s notified breach tracking solution.

The ITRC reports Third\-Party/Supply Chain Attacks as a single attack against the company that lost 
control of the information. The total number of individuals impacted by third\-party incidents is based on 
notices sent by the multiple organizations impacted by the single data compromise.
