The vendors and buying approaches

The right tools for the job make it easy to spot and fix vulnerabilities, 
decrease developer workload, speed time\-to\-production, enhance 
security posture, and automate and orchestrate for fully integrated 
security practices.

The majority of respondents take a best\-of\-breed approach to tool 
selection, looking for the best vendor for any given tooling category, 
rather than opting to be a single vendor shop or build tools 
themselves. 

While this list is not exhaustive, it provides a solid baseline for a 
mature AppSec program.

Which of the following security vendors are you using in your 
software security program?

Where do we deploy?

Shifted to the cloud or running in data 
centers? In 2023, more organizations than 
ever are running most of their workloads in 
the cloud. However, on\-premises is still a 
major force and something organizations 
can’t ignore from a security perspective. 

Where do you deploy applications 
today?

Answer Choices

Reskonses %

“More than half 
of respondents 
deploy 75% or 
more of their 
applications in 
the cloud, and 
a quarter run 
full cloud.”

AppSec prioritization

What’s the most important focus of your AppSec program for 

the 12 months? 

For most organizations, visibility of application security posture and 

automation of critical application security workflows will be the main 

focus for the year. While securing the software supply chain (SBOM) 

comes in last, supply chain attacks continue to rise, increasing risk 

in this key area.

Challenges in running

a successful AppSec program

You’re working on culling too many AppSec alerts. You’re finally 

un\-siloing systems and data effectively. So what are the new 

challenges?

Not having enough funding is a standout challenge in running a 

successful AppSec program among respondents. Other notables are 

in hiring, broader AppSec awareness and lack of leadership buy\-in.

the ground

For AppSec teams, on the ground, the challenges faced day to day 

are different.

We’ve learned that teams are still extremely concerned that there are 

too many vulnerabilities with not enough prioritization. Being able to 

analyze and triangulate results across a variety of tools and highlight 

risk priorities \- even when they’re constantly shifting \- remains 

difficult.
