## Abstract
Digital trust can make or break an organization. It is fundamental to all enterprises and is a critical 
factor in the ability to innovate, expand and be resilient in a turbulent, highly connected global 
marketplace. Digital trust brings together many of the disciplines already vital to an organization—
security, risk, privacy, quality, compliance, communications, information technology, marketing and 
operations. All these areas have a significant and direct impact on how others perceive an organization, 
especially its brand and reputation, and are integral to adding value to the organization and its future 
digital transformation initiatives. 

To gain insights into global approaches and perceptions about digital trust, ISACA® conducted the 
State of Digital Trust 2023 survey in the first quarter of 2023. It is the second annual administration of 
this survey and contains both year-over-year and new data exploring areas such as familiarity, priority, 
confidence, maturity, obstacles and responsibility related to digital trust across the globe. In addition 
to survey data insights, the report also includes practical guidance and perspectives from industry 
professionals. It concludes with five key takeaways to help organizations strengthen digital trust as 
they move forward with digital transformation. 

## Executive Summary
Nearly everyone has received a phone call or 
message that their account has suspicious 
activity, someone is trying to open a credit card 
or apply for a loan in their name or a company 
that has their personal information has been 
hacked. Unfortunately, these increasingly common 
incidents demonstrate social engineering’s ability to 
prey on people. Consumers are already dealing with 
the fatigue of seemingly never-ending end-user 
license agreements and other digital circumstances 
they cannot fully understand. They are tired of their 
web activity being aggregated and sold to others 
just to be incessantly marketed to across their apps 
and browsers. In our rapidly evolving regulatory 
landscape, these patterns call such market trends 
and marketing misalignments into question, as 
compromised pieces of information allow phishing, 
smishing and vishing attempts to become more 
realistic. 

As a result, new and long-time customers, clients, 
vendors, employees, regulators, influencers and 
others start to mistrust organizations. 
These challenges can lead to damaging and time-
consuming problems, ranging from annoying to 
catastrophic, for both private- and public-sector 
organizations. They can result in disruption of 
services, education shutdown, inability to process 
payments, exposure of records, loss of customers, 
weakened market position, stock price declines, 
regulatory fines and sanctions, bond downgrades, 
shareholder unrest, disgruntled employees and 
high costs of remediation, among others.

When these problems occur, some companies 
suffer extensive financial and reputational fallout, 
while others weather the storm and retain, or even 
improve, their reputation and market position. 
The difference between the two outcomes is how 
well an organization navigates digital trust. Trust 
is an essential component that must be addressed 
long before the customer relationship begins and 
must remain a top priority at all times. As face-to-
face transactions become less common, the digital 
ecosystem is now the primary arena for conducting 
business. Customers want to know why they 
- Quality: Assure products and services meet or 
exceed expectations.
- Availability: Enable access to information and 
services in a timely manner.
- Security and privacy: Ensure all data are 
protected and kept confidential.
- Ethics and integrity: Live up to all promises. 
- Transparency and honesty: Be truthful in how 
information is used and if it is compromised. 
- Resiliency: Take steps to ensure 
organizational stability and agility.

KEY FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE 
TO DIGITAL TRUST INCLUDE:

should trust an organization, and enterprises need to 
earn that trust with every interaction and transaction. 
Results from the State of Digital Trust 2023 
survey build upon and reinforce what was 
uncovered in the first report, conducted in 2022. 
Now that the survey is in its second year, it is 
interesting to see that many of the data-driven 
insights remain aligned with what was found 
previously and that trends can be tracked year 
over year. 

Digital trust is a broad topic that goes beyond 
compliance. It involves treating siloed areas of an 
organization as part of a cohesive whole. Nearly all 
organizations are undergoing some level of digital 
transformation, so this is an ideal time to understand 
enterprise motivation and what is and is not working. 
Woven throughout the survey’s global responses 
is the knowledge that one of the most important 
initiatives with the biggest impact is also one with 
possibly the least budget outlay—digital trust. 

Digital trust helps organizations ensure that everything they do contributes to 
others having trust in them—in good times and bad. This concept does not require 
significant new budget allocations or a new C-Suite position. It does recommend an 
umbrella approach over existing functions to ensure digital trust remains a cohesive 
focus in all areas. 

## What Is Digital Trust and Why Is It Important?
Every interaction with a company is unique. It may 
involve financial, demographic, personal or product 
information, but all transactions require that the 
parties establish and maintain trust with each other. 
When transactions were mostly conducted in person, 
many felt that trust was built through eye contact, 
handshakes and physical signatures. At one time, 
these were enough, but with online shopping revenue 
in the U.S. expected to exceed US$1.7 trillion by 2027[^2] 
and 51 percent of hybrid employees saying they are 
considering transitioning to fully remote employment 
in the year ahead,[^3] digital-first work and transactions 
have become the normal way of conducting business. 

Digital trust brings together many of the disciplines 
already critical to an organization, including 
compliance, security, privacy, communications, 
information technology, marketing and operations. 
Alignment should exist between these areas 
because all have a significant, direct impact on 
how others perceive the organization—especially 
its brand and reputation—and are integral to adding 
value to the organization itself and its future digital 
transformation initiatives.

Digital trust can make or break an organization. 
It is fundamental to all enterprises and critical in 
their ability to innovate, expand and be resilient in a 
turbulent, highly connected global marketplace. 
Customers, employees, suppliers and other 
stakeholders need to know that their online 
relationships with an organization are 
reliable and trustworthy. The tolerance for 
any breach of digital trust is near zero.[^1]

Informed consumers often go through steps 
(also known as the digital trust hierarchy) on 
their journey to digital trust with a company, 
asking themselves: 
Do I trust the company enough to:
- Receive and open emails from it?
- Accept cookies from its website, thus 
beginning to trade privacy for convenience? 
- Provide personal information to the company 
via its website? 
- Download its mobile app?
- Pay it money, digitally, in exchange for a 
product or service, thus giving it access to 
credit card, online payment platform or other 
financial information?
- Embark on an ongoing, mutually beneficial 
relationship with it?
- Continue to work with—and trust it—even 
after it has been hacked or experienced a 
negative event?

## Survey Methodology
To gain insights and gather data for the State of Digital Trust 2023 report, 
in January 2023, ISACA sent an online survey to approximately 131,000 
individuals who are members of ISACA or who have earned one of ISACA’s 
certifications or credentials (e.g., CISA®, CISM®, CRISC®, CGEIT®, CDPSE™ and 
CSX-P™). Responses were collected anonymously. A total of 8,185 respondents 
completed the survey, with a margin of error of +/- 1 point. Response rates varied 
by question. The survey used multiple-choice and Likert-scale formats. The 
demographic information is shown in figure 1.

## Survey Results and Insights
Digital trust as a cohesive approach is still emerging as a mainstream initiative 
among boards of directors, executives and professionals. For the past few 
years, it has been addressed in high-level discussions as a nice-to-have but it 
has ambiguous and difficult-to-achieve aspiration. Recent business challenges, 
including new technology, a dynamic regulatory landscape and worldwide shifts in 
labor force and consumer habits—along with the growing frustration of consumers, 
professionals and government officials over repeated breaches of trust—have 
spurred businesses to move digital trust into the realm of a must-have. 

Recognizing this need, ISACA has taken steps to define digital trust in clear 
business language and work in partnership with leading experts to develop 
distinct, customizable guidance based on well-defined and executed research. 

## Familiarity With Digital Trust
Currently, digital trust as a concept has more recognition than digital trust as a 
term. Only 33 percent of survey respondents were extremely or very familiar with 
digital trust as a term prior to being shown ISACA’s definition (see p. 9). After 
hearing the definition, recognition of the term digital trust jumped to 55 percent. 
From a regional perspective, prior to being exposed to the definition, respondents 
from Africa (42 percent) were more familiar with the term digital trust than those 
from Europe (35 percent), Asia (32 percent) and North America (31 percent). 
Those in India (47 percent) were more familiar than those from the other largest 
countries represented in the sample: Canada (35 percent), the UK (33 percent), 
the US (31 percent) and Japan (13 percent).

After learning of ISACA’s definition of digital trust, 
Africa (68 percent) remains more familiar with the 
term than Oceania (60 percent), Europe (56 percent), 
North America (54 percent) and Asia (51 percent).

Across industries, familiarity prior to learning the 
definition was the same among financial/banking 
(31 percent) and government/military (31 percent) 
professionals. Those in technology services/
consulting (40 percent) were slightly more familiar. 
After learning the definition, numbers rose across 
the board with financial/banking (56 percent), 
government/military (54 percent) and technology 
services/consulting (60 percent) professionals. 

This indicates that people are aware of the concept 
and underscores the need for greater exposure to 
a globally accepted definition. Having an agreed-
on definition helps reduce confusion and supports 
common understanding. It is especially important 
as organizations around the world continue to move 
forward with accelerating digital transformation 
initiatives—61 percent believe that digital trust, as 
described in the ISACA survey, can be achieved in 
their organizations.

## Importance and Prioritization of Digital Trust
While 84 percent of respondents feel that digital trust 
is extremely/very important to organizations today, 
and 75 percent feel it is relevant to their organization, 
fewer (64 percent) say their organization prioritizes 
digital trust corresponding to its level of importance. 
Interestingly, 91 percent of those currently measuring 
digital trust maturity feel digital trust is extremely/very 
important to their organization.

When asked if their organization currently prioritizes 
digital trust corresponding to its level of importance, 
respondents from North America (66 percent), Asia 
(65 percent) and Africa (65 percent) were similarly 
aligned than those from Europe (57 percent). The 
same question found that those in India (75 percent) 
are much more likely to prioritize digital trust than 
other regions.

More than three-quarters (76 percent) agree that 
digital trust is extremely or very important to 
digital transformation. As nearly all organizations 
are planning on increasing their pace of digital 
transformation, this is a positive sign that businesses 
clearly understand that these two concepts need to 
proceed in unison. 

DIGITAL TRUST DEFINED
Digital trust is the confidence in the 
integrity of the relationships, interactions 
and transactions among providers and 
consumers within an associated digital 
ecosystem. This includes the ability 
of people, organizations, processes, 
information and technology to create and 
maintain a trustworthy digital world.

Many (82 percent) feel that in five years, digital 
trust will be more or much more important in their 
organization than it is today. Still, only 24 percent are 
planning to increase budgets for digital trust-related 
areas in the next year. This is understandable, as 
many digital trust initiatives are focused on breaking 
down barriers among established siloed areas and 
creating a cohesive lens, or umbrella, that ensures all 
areas are working together and the organization has 
a solid foundation of digital trust. 

From a regional perspective, Africa (94 percent) 
shows the highest level of agreement that digital 
trust is important to organizations, closely followed 
by Oceania (91 percent). This is statistically 
significant over Latin America (86 percent), North 
America (84 percent), Asia (82 percent) and Europe 
(82 percent). Respondents in India (90 percent) rate 
digital trust as extremely/very important, which 
is higher than the other largest countries in the 
sample—Canada (85 percent), the UK (85 percent), 
the US (84 percent) and Japan (68 percent). 

From an industry viewpoint, there is also a high 
level of importance attributed to digital trust among 
professionals in financial/banking (86 percent), 
government/military (84 percent) and technology 
services/consulting (84 percent). 

When considering scoring, 70 percent indicate it is 
extremely/very important for their organization to 
be independently graded on digital trust practices 
with results made publicly available. In addition, 
81 percent agree that organizations that can 
demonstrate their commitment to digital trust (e.g., 
with a high score or rating from an independent 
third-party assessment) will ultimately be more 
successful. This increases to 89 percent among 
those who currently measure digital trust maturity.

DIGITAL TRUST SCORING
Developing an independent, publicly 
available digital trust score for organizations 
is important. Global professionals across 
many organizations have been discussing 
the subject for a long time. This scale 
can serve as a valuable tool to hold 
organizations accountable for their actions, 
but it needs to have globally consistent 
review standards and scope, as well as 
an automated measurement mechanism. 
For example, a highly rated organization 
may have a serious negative incident that 
requires its score to drop several points in a 
matter of minutes. Assessment and review 
parameters have to be active in real time.

Why do some organizations recover and maintain loyalty after one, or even multiple, incidents 
that severely impact digital trust? For many, it relates directly to the company’s actions and 
transparent communications before, during and after an incident. People tend to understand 
and forgive a company if they feel it took precautions and treated their information carefully. 
The same people may also become frustrated and less forgiving when they perceive 
carelessness, lack of attention and lack of communication. 

Why do some organizations recover and maintain loyalty after one, or even 
multiple, incidents that severely impact digital trust? For many, it relates directly to 
the company’s actions and transparent communications before, during and after 
an incident. People tend to understand and forgive a company if they feel it took 
precautions and treated their information carefully. The same people may also 
become frustrated and less forgiving when they perceive carelessness, lack of 
attention and lack of communication. 

Questions to ask when determining why some companies fare better than others 
after an incident or attack that erodes digital trust include:
- Did the company have safety, security, privacy and related policies in place 
and were they followed?
- Did the company voluntarily disclose the incident and provide updates in a 
timely manner?
- Did the company provide remediations/solutions/compensation for 
customer losses?
- Does the company provide ongoing value and innovation to meet 
customer needs?

Survey respondents did identify certain trust-related benefits (figure 2) and 
consequences for not having a strong digital trust posture (figure 3).
The responses were similar to the ISACA State of Digital Trust 2022 report, with a few 
benefits changing places in 2023. Positive reputation was the highest-ranked benefit in 
both years, but more reliable data ranked slightly ahead of fewer privacy breaches and 
fewer cybersecurity incidents in 2023.

![Figure 3 – Consequences of a Lack of Digital Trust: Slower ability to innovate, Negative impact on revenue, Less reliable data for decision making, Loss of customers, More privacy breaches, More cybersecurity incidents, Reputation decline]

The 2023 responses for the consequences of a lack of digital trust were similar to the 2022 report, with the only change that more privacy breaches ranked slightly 
higher than more cybersecurity incidents last year.

![Figure 2 – Digital Trust-related Benefits: Higher revenue, Faster innovation due to confidence in their technology and systems, Stronger customer loyalty, Positive reputation, More reliable data for decision making, Fewer cybersecurity incidents, Fewer privacy breaches]

## Confidence and Maturity Related to Digital Trust
More than half (53 percent) of respondents are completely or very confident in the 
digital trustworthiness of their organization (figure 4). Among those that already 
measure digital trust maturity, this confidence jumps to 81 percent. 

From a regional perspective, Latin America (65 percent) has greater confidence 
in the digital trustworthiness of its organizations compared to all other regions: 
Africa (54 percent), North America (54 percent), Asia (53 percent), Europe (50 
percent) and Oceania (43 percent). 

Professionals’ level of confidence in the digital trustworthiness of their 
organization varies by the industry: technology services/consulting (61 percent), 
financial/banking (59 percent) and government/military (44 percent). 

Measurement of maturity is considered a standard business practice, but fewer 
than one in four respondents (24 percent) indicate their organization currently 
measures the maturity of its digital trust practices, even though 67 percent feel 
it is extremely or very important. Clearly, leadership is a driver of this, as among 
those that measure digital trust, 55 percent have a board of directors that 
prioritizes digital trust, and 59 percent use a digital trust framework. These figures 
are in line with the findings from the ISACA State of Digital Trust 2022 report. 

Respondents in Asia (28 percent) reported the highest level of digital trust 
measurement, with other areas following closely: Africa (26 percent), North 
America (23 percent), Oceania (21 percent) and Europe (19 percent). Those in 
India (40 percent) are overall more likely to say that their organization measures 
digital trust. 

![Figure 4 – Digital Trustworthiness of Organizations: Completely confident, Very confident, Somewhat confident, Not so confident, Not at all confident]

Figure 5 shows the common methods used to measure digital trust with customers, and figure 6 shows methods used to measure digital trust within an enterprise.

![Figure 5 – Popular Methods for Measuring Digital Trust: Customer recommendation surveys, e.g., net promoter score, Monitoring patterns in customer behavior, Monitoring customer retention, Tracking issues raised to customer service, Customer satisfaction surveys]

![Figure 6 – How Digital Trust is Measured in Organizations: Benchmarking against similar enterprises, Customer/client research, e.g., surveys, focus groups, Internal review of trust-related practices]

Despite the proven importance of measurement, 29 percent say that they do not measure digital trust within their organization at all. On the positive side, this is a slight 
improvement from the 2022 survey, which found that 33 percent of respondents did not measure digital trust. 

## Obstacles to Attaining Digital Trust
For every move forward, organizations face their own set of obstacles. One of 
the first steps toward business improvement is to find out what is hindering 
success and then outline a path to address or overcome these challenges. 
Figure 7 provides a view into what respondents are experiencing as top 
obstacles to achieving digital trust in their organizations. 

On a regional basis, overall, Africa reports more obstacles to overcome than 
other regions. It has the highest incidence in the categories of lack of skills and 
training, lack of leadership buy-in, lack of alignment with enterprise goals and 
digital trust not being a priority. Respondents from Oceania rank highest for 
noting the lack of budget. 

The top obstacle reported by industry was lack of skills and training: financial/
banking professionals (53 percent), government/military (54 percent) and 
technology services/consulting (48 percent). 

When comparing responses year-over-year, there has been a positive increase 
related to the lack of skills and training obstacle, indicating an increased 
understanding and value of the benefits of digital trust.
- In 2022, only 29 percent said that their organization offered digital trust training 
to staff, and only 28 percent said they completely understand how their role im­
pacts digital trust, even though 63 percent said digital trust is extremely or very 
relevant to their job. 
- In 2023, 32 percent say that their organization offers digital trust training to 
staff, and 31 percent indicate they completely understand how their role im­
pacts digital trust. In addition, 66 percent now say that digital trust is extremely 
or very relevant to their job today. 

![Figure 7 – Obstacles for Attaining Digital Trust: Digital trust not a priority, Lack of technological resources, Lack of budget, Lack of skills and training, Lack of alignment with enterprise goals, Lack of leadership buy-in]

## Responsibility for Digital Trust
Determining where day-to-day accountability resides 
for digital trust varies among organizations. There is 
currently no single job title or role focusing on digital 
trust that is appropriate for every organization—each 
has its own culture, structure and goals. Figure 8 
shows the top three roles that play a critical role in 
strengthening digital trust.

As part of their fiduciary duty to the organization, 
the board of directors and executive leadership 
clearly need to have ultimate responsibility for 
something as impactful and far reaching as digital 
trust. Yet, only 19 percent globally say that their 
board of directors has prioritized digital trust, and 
approximately one-third (34 percent) say that the 
senior leadership team is ultimately responsible for 
digital trust in the organization. 

From a regional perspective, respondents from 
North America say senior leadership is responsible 
for digital trust, while other regions more often 
say that the board of directors is responsible. 
Respondents in India were more likely than those in 
other countries to say that individual employees are 
responsible for digital trust. 

Professionals in financial/banking (34 percent) 
indicate the board of directors is most responsible, 
while professionals in technology services/
consulting (34 percent) and government/military 
(41 percent) are more likely to say that the senior 
leadership team is responsible. 

Although the position of Chief Digital Trust Officer 
(or similar) does exist at some forward-thinking 
organizations, at this time, many organizations 
do not have an appetite for creating this role. Only 
13 percent say their organization has a staff role 
dedicated to digital trust. Among those that measure 
digital trust maturity, however, the number jumps to 
38 percent that have a dedicated staff role. When the 
board of directors prioritizes digital trust, the number 
of those with a dedicated staff role increases to 46 
percent.

Digital trust encompasses nearly all aspects of an 
organization. As it matures, it is more likely that 
the responsibility will reside with a leader who can 
approach digital trust as an umbrella that covers 
multiple areas, such as compliance, security, 
privacy, communications, information technology, 
marketing/branding and operations. This leader 
will need to be someone who knows each of 

![Figure 8 – Top Three Roles Responsible for Digital Trust: Information technology, Security, IT strategy/governance]

these disciplines (and how they fit together) and 
contributes to a comprehensive approach toward 
digital trust. 

These skills are especially critical, as only half (51 
percent) agree that there is sufficient collaboration 
in their organization among professionals who work 
in diverse digital trust fields such as security, risk, 
governance, assurance, privacy and quality. 

## Digital Trust and Digital Transformation Tools and Frameworks
Digital transformation continues to progress and 
mature in nearly all sectors around the world. In 
recent years, the pace has increased dramatically 
as pressure from stakeholders and peers has 
intensified. 

As organizations further commit to digital 
transformation—and implement innovative, digitally 
enabled services and processes—they must take 
equal time to understand the new vulnerabilities they 
are creating. This is similar to laying down a set of 
railroad tracks that need to operate side-by-side; they 
must deliver on ambitious goals and, at the same 
time, ensure digital transformation-related policies 
and procedures are in place. 

When asked how important digital trust is to 
digital transformation, Africa (91 percent) and 
Latin America (86 percent) responded significantly 
stronger than Oceania (78 percent), Asia (77 
percent), Europe (76 percent) and North America (73 
percent).

This is where digital trust guidance will have a 
significant impact. Only 20 percent currently use 
a framework for their digital trust practices, even 
though 56 percent believe that it is extremely/
very important for an organization to have this 
framework. Among those that do use a framework, 
COBIT® (27 percent) is the most popular, followed by 
the SAFE Identity Trust Framework (10 percent). 

Asia (24 percent), Africa (24 percent) and Latin 
America (22 percent) report using a framework for 
digital trust more than respondents from North 
America (19 percent), Oceania (16 percent) and 
Europe (13 percent).

Respondents in India (34 percent) are more likely 
to have a framework and find it extremely/very 
important to have one in place (76 percent). India 
(85 percent) also had the strongest response among 
the top five countries when asked how important 
digital trust is to digital transformation. 

> Saying that digital trust is part of 
everybody’s job is different than saying 
everybody is responsible for it. Someone 
needs to have accountability for digital 
trust, and this responsibility should be 
entrusted to a leader who has the skills to 
communicate with boards and executive 
leadership effectively, the knowledge to 
manage the many moving parts and the 
ability to motivate employees to excel in 
the daily activities that build and maintain 
digital trust.

## ISACA’s Position in the Digital Trust Space
Organizations and their employees need to be as prepared as possible for known 
issues as well as the unknown and unexpected attacks and incidents awaiting 
them in the future—basically, the things that keep many executives up at night. 
This is particularly important in the fast-moving arena of digital trust. 

ISACA helps address these needs through the development of industry-leading 
tools, credentials, education and training. Respondents say that ISACA enables 
them to stay current with industry trends (84 percent) and be successful in 
their chosen profession (80 percent) and provides opportunities for them to be 
recognized as a thought leader (75 percent).

The rapid growth and challenges in the digital ecosystem mean that ISACA also 
needs to provide timely and effective guidance regarding digital trust. In this defined 
area, respondents say that ISACA is an emerging key player in digital trust (68 
percent), has the tools and resources available for IT professionals to successfully 
deliver digital trust (66 percent), is a recognized leader in digital trust (66 percent) 
and offers a recognized credentialing program in digital trust (57 percent). 

In its quest to inspire knowledge and confidence that enables innovation, 
ISACA’s global community of skilled professionals volunteer their time to develop 
guidance and tools that will help others address current and future challenges. 
Among its work, ISACA is developing a new digital trust ecosystem framework 
to help organizations ensure that their digital trust initiatives are in line with 
their unique mission, vision, values, goals and objectives. The framework will 
help organizations focus on their individual goals as they build a structure that 
supports trust, agility and resilience. 

## Strengthening Digital Trust
While each organization has its own unique goals, strategies and culture, there are many ways to become better positioned for the future. Three steps that organizational 
leaders can take to ensure they are strengthening, focusing on and delivering the highest level of digital trust are:

- ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS. 
- ESTABLISH ENTERPRISEWIDE DIGITAL TRUST GUIDELINES.
- ENSURE ALL ROLES ARE INVOLVED.

> Business leaders should be sure they are 
asking the right questions. For example: 
Does my organization understand all 
the trust factors that go into what our 
customers and stakeholders expect? Are we 
as focused on process, culture and human 
factors as we are on the product or service? 
Do we really understand all the expectations 
and how we will measure whether we meet 
them? Do all employees receive training 
on digital trust? Do our customers know 
how to identify potentially fraudulent 
communications from us and who to 
contact if they are unsure or have issues?

> Ensure that the organization has 
established digital trust as a holistic 
enterprise approach. Everything an 
enterprise does should foster or forward 
digital trust. This should extend to those 
who trust them, those who want to trust 
them and those who need to trust them. The 
approach should include all trust factors that 
enable customers and other stakeholders. 
Policies about trustworthiness are important, 
but enterprises need to go a step further 
and build digital trust into the fabric of the 
enterprise. 

> Everyone has a role to play in ensuring 
digital trust. In addition to fostering 
trust, organizations need to understand 
expectations, not only as an enterprise 
but also as every individual associated 
with or employed by the enterprise. And 
organizations need to understand what it 
means to trust others—who do they trust, 
how do they trust them and what is an 
enterprise doing to ensure that trust is 
well-founded and maintained? In our times 
of increased outsourced data and growing 
supply chain issues, it is more important 
than ever to know what an organization 
should expect and how to measure, assess 
and monitor issues related to digital trust.[^4]

## Five Key Takeaways 
Digital trust guidance should fit each organization’s specific gaps and goals—big benefits can result from 
small changes. 

1. A generally accepted definition of digital trust is the confidence in the integrity of the relationships, 
interactions and transactions among providers and consumers within an associated digital ecosystem. This 
includes the ability of people, organizations, processes, information and technology to create and maintain a 
trustworthy digital world. 

2. Digital trust can make or break an organization. It can be the factor that enables some organizations to recover after 
a major incident while others suffer from serious, time-consuming and expensive ramifications. As organizations 
increasingly move to a digital (or digital-first) business model, trust is an essential component that must be addressed 
before—and throughout—each stakeholder interaction.

3. Digital trust does not necessarily require a significant budget allocation or the creation of a new C-suite position. 
In many instances, digital trust can be approached as an umbrella that ensures existing functions are operating in 
the most optimal manner and that others have trust in the organization, even during negative situations. For some 
organizations, digital trust simply requires a new way of looking at what they are already doing. Big benefits can result 
from small changes. 

4. Today’s 24/7 Internet-connected society means that one person’s bad experience can be broadcast around 
the world in real time. Serious financial, reputational, personal and regulatory repercussions can occur if 
transparency and digital trust are not built into—and enforced in—every area of an organization.

5. Many organizations can benefit from digital trust-related guidance and frameworks by selecting the knowledge 
areas that directly benefit their unique context and business model. Enterprises do not need to adopt full 
frameworks or use a prescribed, one-size-fits-all approach. Effective modern guidance is designed to be pulled apart 
and used as best fits the organization—the organization does not need to fit the guidance or framework. 

## Conclusion
There is little disagreement that new, serious and likely unexpected 
digital issues and incidents will continue in the future. People know 
that the “next big thing” (or multiple little things) is around the corner. 
Whether it be a pandemic, unrest, natural disaster, cyberattack or 
something not yet imagined, the keys to success revolve around 
digital trust, agility and resilience. Negative events and outcomes are 
inescapable in the business environment, but these three success 
factors can help organizations make needed changes quickly, 
strengthen their reputation and retain customer respect and loyalty.
