## Executive Summary

Disruption, transformation, volatility — whichever keyword fits your style, it all points to one fact: change is the constant security teams have had to live by for years. In 2020, the pandemic stress-tested their ability to keep data secure during the global WFH movement. In 2021 and 2022, The Great Resignation exacerbated talent shortages and slowed down vulnerability management. And this year, business pivots, restructures, and hiring freezes dominate the news and security teams’ minds – how do they keep assets secure with fewer resources and more responsibilities?

For our 5th edition of The State of Pentesting, we explore three key areas:

*   The most prevalent security vulnerabilities in over 3,100 pentests completed in 2022 with the help of the Cobalt Core — our community of highly skilled and vetted pentesters;
*   How macroeconomic shifts are affecting organizations’ security standards across the US and EMEA, and;
*   How teams can avoid business disruptions, extract more value from their pentests, and maximize ROI;

**Top 5 most prevalent security issues**

*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   Outdated Software Versions
*   Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
*   Lack of Security Headers
*   Insecure Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocols

**Most Common Findings with Critical Severity**

1.  SQL Injection
2.  Remote Code Execution
3.  Using Default Credentials

**Most Common Findings with High Severity**

1.  Stored Cross-Site Scripting
2.  Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
3.  SQL Injection

**Most Common Findings with High Severity**

1.  Stored Cross-Site Scripting
2.  Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
3.  Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

A note on severity levels: Cobalt uses the OWASP Risk Rating methodology while calculating the severity of any reported finding. Where the application resides, what level of privilege is required, requirement for user interaction, business impact and many other factors which vary business to business determine a finding’s exploit likelihood and impact. Hence, some findings will appear as the most common flaws for multiple risk levels.

## PART 1

### XSS, IDOR, or SQL Injection — What’s Lurking in Your Systems?

The most common vulnerabilities from over 3,100 pentests.

This year, nearly 40% of our findings were related to Server Security Misconfigurations, with the most common issues being Lack of Security Headers, Insecure Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) Cipher Suites, and Fingerprinting/Banner Disclosure.

Other vulnerabilities we saw spanned across the following categories: Cross-Site Scripting (nearly 12% of total findings), Sensitive Data Exposure (10%), Broken Access Control (10%), and Authentication & Sessions (9%).

In fact, Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) was our most common finding for 2022, with the vast majority of discovered flaws earning a Medium or High severity level. Any feature that allows user input can be vulnerable, because it gives attackers an opportunity to inject and store malicious content into web applications. To prevent this, Cobalt recommends treating all user-supplied input as untrusted data and accepting input in select locations. We also recommend using a well-known and secure encoding API for input and output encoding, such as the OWASP ESAPI.

Another common high-impact flaw are Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), with Cobalt Core pentesters marking 85% as either Critical, High, or Medium severity. This vulnerability can give access to resources via user-supplied input, where attackers bypass authorization by modifying a value of a parameter that points directly to an object in your database. Use per-user or per-session indirect object references. Each time your application uses a direct object reference from an untrusted source, it should also make an access control check to ensure that the user is authorized to access the requested object.

Finally, a vulnerability we saw more of in 2022 compared to previous years is the use of Outdated Software Versions. When it takes dozens of apps and programs to keep a website, product, or business running, staying on top of updates for all of them can quickly spiral out of control. Despite this vulnerability having a reputation as a low-risk issue, our pentesters marked it as Critical, High, or Medium severity 14% of the time.

**Most common findings per vulnerability category.**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting**
    *   Stored XSS
    *   Reflected XSS
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure**
    *   Visible Detailed Error/Debug Page
    *   Disclosure of Known Public Information
    *   Sensitive Token in URL
*   **Broken Access Control**
    *   Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery
    *   Username/Email enumeration
*   **Authentication & Sessions**
    *   Failure to Invalidate Sessions
    *   Privilege Escalation
    *   Concurrent Logins

### Server Security Misconfigurations continue to dominate.

### Stored XSS and IDOR introduce high levels of risk.

As we work with customers to improve their security posture, we observe fewer and fewer vulnerabilities marked as high, medium, or critical severity. The majority of our 2022 findings were on the lower end of the risk scale, with nearly 60% being Low severity.

| Severity Level | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |
| :------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| Critical       |  1.4%   |  0.8%   |  1.2%   |
| High           |  13.7%  |  9.9%   |  9.2%   |
| Medium         |  30.5%  |  24.2%  |  19.5%  |
| Low            |  46.9%  |  53.8%  |  59.9%  |
| Informational  |  7.4%   |  11.2%  |  10.2%  |

*Image Description: A bar graph showing the distribution of severity levels for findings in 2020, 2021, and 2022. The graph shows that the majority of findings are low severity, and the percentage of low severity findings has increased over the years.*

And yet, teams need to remain vigilant. In 2022 we discovered more than 16,000 findings, and while the majority posed minimal impact, two of the three most repetitive flaws — Stored Cross-Site Scripting and Insecure Direct Object References — had the potential for serious damage, with pentesters marking them frequently as Medium or High severity. We recommend proactively checking for these flaws, whether through internal reviews or via a targeted pentest.

**Most Common Findings with Critical Severity**

1.  SQL Injection
2.  Remote Code Execution
3.  Using Default Credentials

**Most Common Findings with High Severity**

1.  Stored Cross-Site Scripting
2.  Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
3.  SQL Injection

**Most Common Findings with Medium Severity**

1.  Stored Cross-Site Scripting
2.  Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
3.  Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

A note on severity levels: Cobalt uses the OWASP Risk Rating methodology while calculating the severity of any reported finding. Where the application resides, what level of privilege is required, requirement for user interaction, business impact and many other factors which vary business to business determine a finding’s exploit likelihood and impact. Hence, some findings will appear as the most common flaws for multiple risk levels.

*   **Critical**: Includes vulnerabilities such as administrative access, remote code execution, financial theft, and more.
*   **High**: Includes high probability vulnerabilities with a high business impact.
*   **Medium**: Vulnerabilities that are “Medium risk <> Medium impact,” “Low risk <> High impact,” or “High risk <> Low impact.”
*   **Low**: Specifies common vulnerabilities with minimal impact on their own, but possibly dangerous if chained.
*   **Informational**: Notes vulnerabilities of minimal risk to your business.

    *   Weak Password Policy
    *   Non-Sensitive Application Data Stored Unencrypted

### A large portion of vulnerabilities remain unaddressed at each severity level.

As we help customers remediate vulnerabilities, we can observe how teams react to these findings. The scenarios we see are:

*   Teams fix the finding and request a retest to confirm if the fix is working correctly (i.e. validate). Note that we offer retests on discovered findings for free, so there is no financial barrier.
*   Teams mark the finding as “Accepted Risk” because its severity level doesn’t meet their remediation threshold, or a compromising control is in place.
*   Teams don’t request a retest. The finding could have been remediated, but a retest hasn’t checked whether their fix is working. Alternatively, it’s staying in their backlogs for an indefinite period of time.

At the time of writing this report, customers had remediated, retested, and confirmed as fixed 25% of the findings we discovered in 2022. That number changes depending on a finding’s criticality and the customer’s company size.

For example, smaller companies of up to 50 employees have retested and fixed a sizeably larger portion of their vulnerabilities compared to larger organizations, although that figure does drop considerably with lower-risk findings. This is a trend we observe across the board, which in one part should not come as a surprise — teams have to prioritize, but they do leave themselves vulnerable to chained exploits from lower-risk findings.

What gives us pause is that just 61% of critical vulnerabilities in our database, regardless of company size, have been confirmed as fixed. That number drops to as low as 31% for medium-severity findings. This suggests a considerable security gap — despite their pentests, many organizations still remain at risk of a successful attack. In the next section, we dig deeper into what might be holding them back from strengthening their security postures.

*Image Description: A bar graph showing the percentage of fixed and retested findings for 2022 per criticality level and company size. The graph shows that smaller companies tend to fix a larger portion of vulnerabilities, and that the percentage of fixed vulnerabilities decreases as the severity level decreases.*

**Percentage of fixed and retested findings for 2022 per criticality level and company size.**

*   Of 2022 findings confirmed as fixed: 25%
*   Of critical findings potentially untreated: 39%

## PART 2

### From Micro to Macro
How layoffs and budget cuts are impacting security teams’ work.

### Layoffs and budget cuts are prevalent in the US, applying more pressure compared to Europe.

Our data shows that, following the pressures of the pandemic-fueled Great Resignation in 2021, security teams now face additional industry headwinds. High employee turnover and scant bandwidth still hamstring productivity, with mounting pressure to restructure and cut costs amidst speculation of a downturn.

To best understand how security teams fare against these larger economic trends, we surveyed 1006 professionals in the field: 501 in the US, and 505 in the UK & Germany. To limit the scope of our research to the US felt shortsighted, and so we chose additional countries in an effort to better represent the global community (and hope to continue the shift in future reports).

In the US, three-fourths of respondents share that their department had been directly impacted by company layoffs in the last six months. Roughly the same number (72%) said someone from their team had also resigned, and more than half expect further firings. In addition, the majority have been affected by hiring freezes (66%) or recruitment slowdowns (67%).

In the UK and Germany, we see a very different picture. Only one-fourth said their team had been affected by layoffs, less than half (44%) said a security colleague had resigned, and less than a third (29%) expect layoffs in 2023. However, the majority (61%) reported their company has announced a recruitment slowdown for 2023.

In the finance realm, just 28% of UK and German respondents shared their budgets had been cut. That figure was more than double for the US, and we see the same trend when comparing how large the cuts had been on average: 31% for the US, and 16% for the UK and Germany.

The contrast is striking, and it’s challenging to pin this to one specific reason. Many factors can be at play, including differences in labor laws, fiscal strategies, and previous hiring decisions. But cybersecurity more often than not works as one large global ecosystem, where one breach can affect many — it’s safe to say it’s being put under considerable pressure.

**Impact on cybersecurity practitioners whose teams have been affected by layoffs and budget cuts.**

| Impact                        | US  | UK & DE |
| :---------------------------- | :-: | :-----: |
| The scope of their role increased | 95% |  29%   |
| Experiencing burnout           | 84% |  50%   |
| Want to quit                  | 60% |  20%   |

*Image Description: A table showing the impact of layoffs and budget cuts on cybersecurity practitioners in the US and UK & Germany. The table shows that US practitioners are more likely to experience increased scope, burnout, and the desire to quit.*

To ensure unbiased results, no respondents were Cobalt customers.

### Many of the affected teams struggle to maintain high security standards.

Where the similarities begin is how layoffs and budget cuts are impacting security teams’ work. The vast majority of affected teams report their workloads have become unmanageable, and both sides struggle equally with maintaining security at a high enough standard.

Not only that, but a large portion of affected US respondents (73%, 15 points higher than UK & DE) shared they’re struggling to monitor and respond to vulnerabilities and incidents. Their top-of-mind concerns are Sensitive data exposure, Server security misconfigurations, and Network security misconfigurations.

Teams in the UK and Germany have similar concerns, though they ranked Insecure data storage higher (see next page).

| Challenge                                    | US  | UK & DE |
| :------------------------------------------- | :-: | :-----: |
| Report workloads are hard to manage         | 89% |  83%   |
| Struggle to maintain high security standards | 61% |  61%   |
| Struggle to monitor and respond to vulnerabilities & incidents | 73% |  58%   |

*Image Description: A table showing the challenges faced by security teams in the US and UK & Germany due to layoffs and budget cuts. The table shows that US teams are more likely to struggle with monitoring and responding to vulnerabilities.*

### Which vulnerabilities is your security team most concerned about?

1.  Sensitive Data Exposure
2.  Server Security Misconfigurations
3.  Network Security Misconfigurations
4.  Insecure Data Storage
5.  Server-Side Injections
6.  Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
7.  Broken Access Control
8.  Broken Authentication & Session Management
9.  Cross-Site Scripting
10. Lack of Binary Hardening
11. Cross-Site Request Forgery

### Fewer resources lead to more and more unaddressed vulnerabilities.

In the US, 89% of affected teams struggle to collaborate with their dev counterparts, whereas in the UK and Germany 59% reported this problem — 30 points lower than the US, but still a sizable portion.

Both sides complained equally that their dev teams show a lack of urgency in fixing vulnerabilities. For the US, this led to nearly all (96%) of affected respondents saying critical vulnerabilities get fixed more slowly, and more than three-fourths reported the same problem for high- and medium-severity vulnerabilities. Alarmingly, 76% said their backlog of unaddressed bugs increased in 2022 due to lack of resources, and 82% said they expect this problem to only worsen.

In the UK and Germany, teams were not as pessimistic, but the picture wasn’t much improved. 79% shared that their dev team was slower to remediate critical vulnerabilities, and 65% expect the problem to worsen in 2023.

**What challenges do you experience when working with your dev team?**

| Statement                                           | US    | UK & DE |
| :-------------------------------------------------- | :----: | :-----: |
| “Fewer resources led to a backlog of unaddressed vulnerabilities in 2022.” | 76%   |  65%   |
| “I expect this problem to worsen in 2023.”           | 82%   |  80%   |

*Image Description: A table showing the impact of fewer resources on vulnerability remediation in the US and UK & Germany. The table shows that US teams are more likely to experience a backlog of unaddressed vulnerabilities and expect the problem to worsen.*

### US teams plan to lean much more on third parties compared to their European counterparts.

When it comes to how teams will move forward, US respondents plan to outsource more work compared to 2022. At the top of their outsource list are addressing discovered vulnerabilities, vendor security reviews, and pursuing optional compliance certifications, e.g., SOC 2 or ISO 27001 (see next page).

As far as what they plan to deprioritize: the top projects to go are implementing DevSecOps practices (interestingly, UK and DE respondents plan to continue pursuing this through outsourcing), hiring, and adopting new technology.

In the UK and Germany, respondents are leaning more towards deprioritizing (66%). Less time and fewer resources will go into adopting new technology, hiring, and personal development.

> Deprioritizing business-critical projects can be a dangerous move: on one hand, you’re trying to protect your team from burnout, but on the other, you’re creating more opportunity for vulnerabilities to materialize or stay unaddressed, compromising the defenses around your organization. It’s a tough balance to strike, and sometimes doing it alone is not the answer. A good external team can help balance the scales.

### Teams struggle with preparing for their pentests and experience business disruptions.

Most security teams did between one and three pentests in 2022, but a much more sizable portion in the UK and Germany did more than six pentests.

In the US, compliance was the most common goal (48% selected, see next page), followed by fulfilling customer requests, and testing new features in their application.

The top objectives in the UK and Germany were checking for specific vulnerabilities (66% selected), fulfilling a compliance requirement, and testing for cloud misconfigurations.

With time and resources in short supply, every pentest should deliver results quickly with no disruption to infrastructure. That, however, is not the case. More than half (62%) of US respondents said engagements with different vendors had disrupted their business operations, and 66% shared they had had to do unexpected clean-up after the test (not counting fixing vulnerabilities the tests had discovered).

In the UK and Germany, fewer complained of these challenges, but where they did struggle is preparing their environment accurately for the test.

Teams are under pressure to achieve more with less, and an unproductive, disruptive pentest does not help them get closer to their goals. Your pentesting vendor should take charge and ensure tests run smoothly, but that’s not to say things are entirely out of your control. In the next part of the report, we share practical steps on how to prepare for each test and extract maximum value, guided by insights from the Cobalt Core — our community of 400+ skilled and vetted pentesting professionals.

## PART 3

### Set Up Your Pentests for Success
Recommendations from Cobalt’s pentesters on how to prepare and maximize ROI.

### Set up the pentest for success with a clear objective and accurate scope.

Out of the 3,100 pentests we did in 2022, the top areas that slowed the process down were:

*   Testers lacking credentials or necessary access before the test starts
*   Scope misalignment
*   No active collaboration throughout the test
*   Missing brief/asset information

We’ll go over how your team can tackle each of these items, but let’s start at the beginning: setting an objective and scoping the test correctly. Most of the time, unclear details in this stage are what leads to misalignments and business disruptions later on.

Start with a clear, achievable objective. Before you kick off your next pentest, align internally on what you want it to achieve, what needs to get tested, and are there areas testers should prioritize. It’s important to do as much of this as you can before you kick things off with your vendor, because pentests are typically a time-bound exercise; once the clock starts ticking, clearing up details will cost you valuable time and resources.

A clear objective leads to an accurate scope, and an accurate scope means more targeted pentests. One of the first things that should happen when you approach your pentest vendor is to confirm your desired scope. To give pentesters the chance to test in depth, you should provide more than your application’s URL or how many static/dynamic pages it has. Consider including more insight into the complexity of your asset, answering questions like:

*   How many functionalities does your app support?
*   What third-party services does your app call?
*   How many user roles are there, or how many should the testers focus on?
*   Are there any unique setup requirements pentesters should fulfill to follow your internal processes? (e.g. setting up MFA, dummy credentials, signing NDAs, etc.)

Having this information will help your vendor correctly estimate how many testers need to join the project, what skills are required, and how long the engagement should take. If not shared in the preparation stage, this information will still come up — only later, once the pentest has already started and hours go into recalibrating the project instead of analyzing your assets.

> If your internal stakeholders’ expectations contradict each other, you may end up starting a white- or gray-box test, only to have to change it to a black-box exercise halfway through. The testers will no longer be in the right mindset and that will hurt results. Take 2-3 days to get everything aligned internally, and you’ll have a much more productive pentest.

**To-do list before the test starts:**

1.  Align all internal stakeholders on what the goal of your pentest is and what assets should be in scope — then communicate this information to your vendor.
2.  Describe the in-scope assets with information on endpoints, URLs, number of static and dynamic pages, etc.
3.  Include information on the complexity of your asset, covering the questions we suggest on this page for a more accurate scope — if you want a black-box test, these details don’t have
