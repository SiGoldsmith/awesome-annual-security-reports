Executive Summary

Disruption, transformation, volatility — 
whichever keyword fits your style, it all 
points to one fact: change is the constant 
security teams have had to live by for 
years. In 2020, the pandemic stress\-tested 
their ability to keep data secure during the 
global WFH movement. In 2021 and 2022, 
The Great Resignation exacerbated talent 
shortages and slowed down vulnerability 
management. And this year, business pivots, 
restructures, and hiring freezes dominate 
the news and security teams’ minds – how 
do they keep assets secure with fewer 
resources and more responsibilities?

For our 5th edition of The State of 
Pentesting, we explore three key areas:

•

•

•

The most prevalent security 
vulnerabilities in over 3,100 pentests 
completed in 2022 with the help of the 
Cobalt Core — our community of highly 
skilled and vetted pentesters; 

How macroeconomic shifts are 
affecting organizations’ security 
standards across the US and EMEA, 
and; 

How teams can avoid business 
disruptions, extract more value from 
their pentests, and maximize ROI;

A note on severity levels: Cobalt uses the OWASP Risk Rating 

methodology while calculating the severity of any reported finding. 

Where the application resides, what level of privilege is required, 

requirement for user interaction, business impact and many other 

factors which vary business to business determine a finding’s exploit 

likelihood and impact. Hence, some findings will appear as the most 

common flaws for multiple risk levels.

XSS, IDOR, or SQL Injection — 
What’s Lurking in Your Systems?

The most common vulnerabilities from over 3,100 pentests.

Server Security Misconfigurations continue to dominate.

This year, nearly 40% of our findings were related to Server Security Misconfigurations, 
with the most common issues being Lack of Security Headers, Insecure Secure Sockets 
Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) Cipher Suites, and Fingerprinting/Banner 
Disclosure. 

Other vulnerabilities we saw spanned across the following categories: Cross\-Site Scripting 
(nearly 12% of total findings), Sensitive Data Exposure (10%), Broken Access Control (10%), 
and Authentication \& Sessions (9%). 

In fact, Stored Cross\-Site Scripting (XSS) was our most common finding for 2022, with the 
vast majority of discovered flaws earning a Medium or High severity level. Any feature that 
allows user input can be vulnerable, because it gives attackers an opportunity to inject and 
store malicious content into web applications. To prevent this, Cobalt recommends treating 
all user\-supplied input as untrusted data and accepting input in select locations. We also 
recommend using a well\-known and secure encoding API for input and output encoding, 
such as the OWASP ESAPI. 

Another common high\-impact flaw are Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), with 
Cobalt Core pentesters marking 85% as either Critical, High, or Medium severity. This 
vulnerability can give access to resources via user\-supplied input, where attackers bypass 
authorization by modifying a value of a parameter that points directly to an object in your 
database. Use per\-user or per\-session indirect object references. Each time your application 
uses a direct object reference from an untrusted source, it should also make an access 
control check to ensure that the user is authorized to access the requested object.

Finally, a vulnerability we saw more of in 2022 compared to previous years is the use of 
Outdated Software Versions. When it takes dozens of apps and programs to keep a website, 
product, or business running, staying on top of updates for all of them can quickly spiral out 
of control. Despite this vulnerability having a reputation as a low\-risk issue, our pentesters 
marked it as Critical, High, or Medium severity 14% of the time.

Stored XSS and IDOR introduce high levels of risk.

As we work with customers to improve their security posture, we observe fewer and fewer 
vulnerabilities marked as high, medium, or critical severity. The majority of our 2022 findings 
were on the lower end of the risk scale, with nearly 60% being Low severity.

And yet, teams need to remain vigilant. In 2022 we discovered more than 16,000 findings, 
and while the majority posed minimal impact, two of the three most repetitive flaws — 
Stored Cross\-Site Scripting and Insecure Direct Object References — had the potential for 
serious damage, with pentesters marking them frequently as Medium or High severity. We 
recommend proactively checking for these flaws, whether through internal reviews or via a 
targeted pentest.

A large portion of vulnerabilities 
remain unaddressed at each 
severity level.

As we help customers remediate vulnerabilities, we can observe how teams react to these 
findings. The scenarios we see are:

•

•

•

Teams fix the finding and request a retest to confirm if the fix is working correctly 
(i.e. validate). Note that we offer retests on discovered findings for free, so there 
is no financial barrier.

Teams mark the finding as “Accepted Risk” because its severity level doesn’t 
meet their remediation threshold, or a compromising control is in place.

Teams don’t request a retest. The finding could have been remediated, but a 
retest hasn’t checked whether their fix is working. Alternatively, it’s staying in 
their backlogs for an indefinite period of time. 

At the time of writing this report, customers had remediated, retested, and confirmed as 
fixed 25% of the findings we discovered in 2022\. That number changes depending on a 
finding’s criticality and the customer’s company size.

For example, smaller companies of up to 50 employees have retested and fixed a sizeably 
larger portion of their vulnerabilities compared to larger organizations, although that figure 
does drop considerably with lower\-risk findings. This is a trend we observe across the board, 
which in one part should not come as a surprise — teams have to prioritize, but they do 
leave themselves vulnerable to chained exploits from lower\-risk findings. 

What gives us pause is that just 61% of critical vulnerabilities in our database, regardless 
of company size, have been confirmed as fixed. That number drops to as low as 31% 
for medium\-severity findings. This suggests a considerable security gap — despite their 
pentests, many organizations still remain at risk of a successful attack. In the next section, 
we dig deeper into what might be holding them back from strengthening their security 
postures.

PART 2
From Micro to Macro

How layoffs and budget cuts are impacting security teams’ work.

10

Layoffs and budget cuts are prevalent in the US, 
applying more pressure compared to Europe.

Our data shows that, following the pressures of the pandemic\-fueled Great Resignation in 
2021, security teams now face additional industry headwinds. High employee turnover and 
scant bandwidth still hamstring productivity, with mounting pressure to restructure and cut 
costs amidst speculation of a downturn.

To best understand how security teams fare against these larger economic trends, we 
surveyed 1006 professionals in the field: 501 in the US, and 505 in the UK \& Germany. To 
limit the scope of our research to the US felt shortsighted, and so we chose additional 
countries in an effort to better represent the global community (and hope to continue the 
shift in future reports).

In the US, three\-fourths of respondents share that their department had been directly 
impacted by company layoffs in the last six months. Roughly the same number (72%) said 
someone from their team had also resigned, and more than half expect further firings. In 
addition, the majority have been affected by hiring freezes (66%) or recruitment slowdowns 
(67%).

In the UK and Germany, we see a very different picture. Only one\-fourth said their team had 
been affected by layoffs, less than half (44%) said a security colleague had resigned, and 
less than a third (29%) expect layoffs in 2023\. However, the majority (61%) reported their 
company has announced a recruitment slowdown for 2023\.

In the finance realm, just 28% of UK and German respondents shared their budgets had 
been cut. That figure was more than double for the US, and we see the same trend when 
comparing how large the cuts had been on average: 31% for the US, and 16% for the UK and 
Germany. 

The contrast is striking, and it’s challenging to pin this to one specific reason. Many factors 
can be at play, including differences in labor laws, fiscal strategies, and previous hiring 
decisions. But cybersecurity more often than not works as one large global ecosystem, 
where one breach can affect many — it’s safe to say it’s being put under considerable 
pressure.

To ensure unbiased 
results, no respondents 
were Cobalt customers.

Where the similarities begin is how layoffs and budget cuts are impacting security 
teams’ work. The vast majority of affected teams report their workloads have become 
unmanageable, and both sides struggle equally with maintaining security at a high enough 
standard. 

Not only that, but a large portion of affected US respondents (73%, 15 points higher than 
UK \& DE) shared they’re struggling to monitor and respond to vulnerabilities and incidents. 
Their top\-of\-mind concerns are Sensitive data exposure, Server security misconfigurations, 
and Network security misconfigurations. 

Teams in the UK and Germany have similar concerns, though they ranked Insecure data 
storage higher (see next page).

What challenges do you experience when 
working with your dev team?

Fewer resources lead to 
more and more unaddressed 
vulnerabilities.

In the US, 89% of affected teams struggle to collaborate with their dev counterparts, whereas 
in the UK and Germany 59% reported this problem — 30 points lower than the US, but still a 
sizable portion.

Both sides complained equally that their dev teams show a lack of urgency in fixing 
vulnerabilities. For the US, this led to nearly all (96%) of affected respondents saying 
critical vulnerabilities get fixed more slowly, and more than three\-fourths reported the same 
problem for high\- and medium\-severity vulnerabilities. Alarmingly, 76% said their backlog of 
unaddressed bugs increased in 2022 due to lack of resources, and 82% said they expect this 
problem to only worsen.

In the UK and Germany, teams were not as pessimistic, but the picture wasn’t much 
improved. 79% shared that their dev team was slower to remediate critical vulnerabilities, 
and 65% expect the problem to worsen in 2023\.

US teams plan to lean 
much more on third parties 
compared to their European 
counterparts.

When it comes to how teams will move forward, US respondents plan to outsource more 
work compared to 2022\. At the top of their outsource list are addressing discovered 
vulnerabilities, vendor security reviews, and pursuing optional compliance certifications, e.g., 
SOC 2 or ISO 27001 (see next page). 

As far as what they plan to deprioritize: the top projects to go are implementing DevSecOps 
practices (interestingly, UK and DE respondents plan to continue pursuing this through 
outsourcing), hiring, and adopting new technology. 

In the UK and Germany, respondents are leaning more towards deprioritizing (66%). 
Less time and fewer resources will go into adopting new technology, hiring, and personal 
development.

Deprioritizing business\-critical projects can be a dangerous move: 
on one hand, you’re trying to protect your team from burnout, but 
on the other, you’re creating more opportunity for vulnerabilities to 
materialize or stay unaddressed, compromising the defenses around 
your organization. It’s a tough balance to strike, and sometimes 
doing it alone is not the answer. A good external team can help 
balance the scales.”

Teams struggle with preparing for their pentests and 
experience business disruptions.

Most security teams did between one and three pentests in 2022, but a much more sizable 
portion in the UK and Germany did more than six pentests. 

In the UK and Germany, fewer complained of these challenges, but where they did struggle is 
preparing their environment accurately for the test. 

In the US, compliance was the most common goal (48% selected, see next page), followed 
by fulfilling customer requests, and testing new features in their application.

The top objectives in the UK and Germany were checking for specific vulnerabilities (66% 
selected), fulfilling a compliance requirement, and testing for cloud misconfigurations. 

With time and resources in short supply, every pentest should deliver results quickly with 
no disruption to infrastructure. That, however, is not the case. More than half (62%) of 
US respondents said engagements with different vendors had disrupted their business 
operations, and 66% shared they had had to do unexpected clean\-up after the test (not 
counting fixing vulnerabilities the tests had discovered). 

Teams are under pressure to achieve more with less, and an unproductive, disruptive pentest 
does not help them get closer to their goals. Your pentesting vendor should take charge and 
ensure tests run smoothly, but that’s not to say things are entirely out of your control. In the 
next part of the report, we share practical steps on how to prepare for each test and extract 
maximum value, guided by insights from the Cobalt Core — our community of 400\+ skilled 
and vetted pentesting professionals.

PART 3
Set Up Your Pentests for Success

Recommendations from Cobalt’s pentesters on how to prepare and maximize ROI.

20

Set up the pentest for success with a 
clear objective and accurate scope.

Out of the 3,100 pentests we did in 2022, the top areas that slowed the process down were: 

•
•
•
•

Testers lacking credentials or necessary access before the test starts
Scope misalignment 
No active collaboration throughout the test
Missing brief/asset information

We’ll go over how your team can tackle each of these items, but let’s start at the beginning: setting an objective 
and scoping the test correctly. Most of the time, unclear details in this stage are what leads to misalignments 
and business disruptions later on.

Start with a clear, achievable objective. Before you kick off your next pentest, align internally on what you want 
it to achieve, what needs to get tested, and are there areas testers should prioritize. It’s important to do as 
much of this as you can before you kick things off with your vendor, because pentests are typically a time\-bound 
exercise; once the clock starts ticking, clearing up details will cost you valuable time and resources. 

A clear objective leads to an accurate scope, and an accurate scope means more targeted pentests. One of 
the first things that should happen when you approach your pentest vendor is to confirm your desired scope. 
To give pentesters the chance to test in depth, you should provide more than your application’s URL or how 
many static/dynamic pages it has. Consider including more insight into the complexity of your asset, answering 
questions like:

•
•
•
•

How many functionalities does your app support? 
What third\-party services does your app call? 
How many user roles are there, or how many should the testers focus on?
Are there any unique setup requirements pentesters should fulfill to follow your internal processes? 
(e.g. setting up MFA, dummy credentials, signing NDAs, etc.) 

Having this information will help your vendor correctly estimate how many testers need to join the project, 
what skills are required, and how long the engagement should take. If not shared in the preparation stage, this 
information will still come up — only later, once the pentest has already started and hours go into recalibrating 
the project instead of analyzing your assets.

If your internal stakeholders’ expectations contradict each 
other, you may end up starting a white\- or gray\-box test, 
only to have to change it to a black\-box exercise halfway 
through. The testers will no longer be in the right mindset 
and that will hurt results. Take 2\-3 days to get everything 
aligned internally, and you’ll have a much more productive 
pentest.“

Tracy Harper 

Lead Technical Project Manager at Cobalt

To\-do list before the 
test starts:

1

2

3

Align all internal stakeholders on what the goal of 
your pentest is and what assets should be in scope 
— then communicate this information to your vendor.

Describe the in\-scope assets with information on 
endpoints, URLs, number of static and dynamic 
pages, etc.

Include information on the complexity of your asset, 
covering the questions we suggest on this page for 
a more accurate scope — if you want a black\-box 
test, these details don’t have to reach the pentesters 
joining your project, but your vendor should still be 
aware in order to staff appropriately.

21

“Familiarize the pentesters with how 
things are supposed to work.

Sometimes your goal will be to simulate an external attack through a black\-box pentest, and there’s definitely 
value in that exercise. However, it’s important to note that no black\-box pentest will perfectly simulate an 
external attacker. Pentests are time\-bound, whereas externals can have unlimited time for reconnaissance. 
What’s more, insider threats can be just as destructive. To capture more scenarios, we recommend a gray\- or 
white\-box pentest, where testers have access to documentation outlining setup, business logic, and internal 
knowledge. 

Documentation gets the testers quickly up to speed and can range from diagrams to walkthrough videos to 
data flow charts — it all depends on how your asset is set up. For example, say you’re pentesting for PCI DSS 
compliance: when testers know how you meant to segment your cardholder data environment from the rest of 
your systems, they can confirm whether that is in fact working correctly and can withstand attacks. 

Documentation doesn’t just make testers’ lives easier — it also makes your findings more accurate, 
particularly their severity levels. When testers know the context around your assets and operations, they’re 
able to determine a finding’s likelihood and impact much more accurately, in a way that’s customized to your 
circumstances. They can also get creative with your functionalities: instead of following the steps A, B, and C 
listed in your documentation, they can report if it’s possible to jump from A to C, and whether that move can 
cause issues that expose sensitive information. Ultimately, giving your testers context enables them to deliver 
the value that makes pentests unique from scanners and other automated tools — you receive results that are 
specific to your situation and aligned to your business context. 

And, you guessed it, you should provide documentation as part of your test prep, not throughout the testing 
process — otherwise you’ll spend 2\-3 days meant for testing on gathering paperwork. 

As pentesters, we see a lot of applications, and we 
have only a little bit of insight before we start on our 
next project. It really helps us focus when we know 
the main areas of the application, what exactly are the 
functionalities, and are users actually able to follow your 
logic flow without breaking things. This way we can 
confirm not only where someone external can attack, but 
also where an internal user might unknowingly create a 
vulnerability or flaw in your systems.”

Decide if you want to have a black\-, gray\-, or white\-
box pentest.

Share documentation on how your asset(s) are built, 
how they are meant to function, where data flows, 
etc. 

Example documentation includes: walkthrough 
videos/demos, process diagrams, data flow charts, 
user role breakdowns, access control matrix.

“Prepare a staging environment and 
your colleagues for the test.

Business disruptions happen most often when tests are taking place in a production environment. While a test 
on production will give the most accurate picture of your vulnerabilities, we recommend creating an exact mirror 
image on a staging environment and directing your pentesters there. 

“Mirror image” is the important keyword here. If you have even a slightly outdated version of your application 
on staging, this can hurt your pentests’ results. When you request testers to replicate a discovered issue on 
production, you take time away from hunting for other issues. Not only that, but mixing environments makes 
your pentest report much more complex, which might complicate audits or conversations with customers 
reviewing your security. 

In addition to preparing your environment, you should also prepare the credentials that will grant pentesters 
the access they need to continue with their work once they’re finished reviewing your app from an 
“unauthenticated” point of view — this is a stage most pentests will start with by default. Having credentials 
sorted out in advance saves you time during the pentest. This is especially true if the setup isn’t something you 
directly manage: going back and forth with your engineers can take 2\-3 days from your pentest, wasting time 
and resources. 

We understand that credential sharing can make teams nervous, both because they involve a high degree of 
trust, and because the process can get complicated. We recommend your team creates bogus credentials you 
can quickly spin up and disable after the test’s end. In addition, pentest vendors should mandate their testers to 
work via a VPN, so you can whitelist their IP addresses prior to the test’s start and monitor their requests. If a 
separate team is responsible for security monitoring, make sure they’re aware a test will be taking place so they 
don’t unknowingly block the testers from moving forward.

In contrast to bug bounty, pentesting – in particular, 
PtaaS – encourages collaboration and professionalism, 
both with other testers as well as clients. I pentest to 
hone my skills, but also want to get high satisfaction 
ratings so I can pentest more, and earn more. So 
delivering on the concept of ‘value’ is extremely 
important. It’s something I wish more businesses were 
aware of so they could set engagements up for success 
at the outset. Our relationship is mutually beneficial.”

“Collaborate with the pentesters for 
a more productive test and better 
insights into your vulnerabilities. 

Testers love customers who are proactive and quick to 
reply. Their enthusiasm motivates us to cover even more 
in our limited time frame. The more active the customer, 
the better the pentest results.”

Harsh Bothra Lead Cobalt Pentester

You’ve gone through all the prep steps, provided documentation, set up your environment, and informed internal 
teams. The test has begun, and you can step back, right? Not quite. 

Pentests are becoming more and more of a collaborative process, where the testers communicate directly with 
customers and share updates as soon as they find issues, especially high\-severity ones. At least, this is how it 
works with Pentest as a Service. 

Testers are highly\-skilled security experts whose time you’re paying for — take advantage of that. To squeeze 
every bit of value from your pentest, instead of completely stepping away, we recommend actively engaging 
with the testers, asking them questions around their findings and methodology, and just as importantly, 
answering their questions too. When testers discover unexpected behaviors, they reach out to confirm if this 
is an undocumented functionality, or in fact a flaw. If left unanswered, pentesters will continue with their next 
steps, but the results will likely lack important context. This creates extra work for you at the end of the test — 
whether to document why you’re accepting the risk from a vulnerability your team doesn’t consider an issue, or 
dispute findings altogether. It hurts results and your bandwidth. 

Sometimes you might not have the answers and will need time to gather info from other internal teams. We 
recommend removing the silos between the pentesters and your colleagues, and not just those responsible for 
security — consider inviting members from the development team, who can answer technical questions and 
simultaneously learn more about their app’s security. Add them to the Slack channel, comment thread, or email 
chain, whichever you’re using with your vendor. This way, people have direct access to each other and can move 
things forward quickly — otherwise, you risk losing days of testing to internal alignment.

To\-do list before the 
test starts:

2

Establish a point of contact (POC) from your team 
who can liaison with the testers. 

That POC should be responsive to the results of a 
pentest, analyze results, and ask questions if more 
info is needed.

3

The POC should also be available to help remove 
blockers slowing down the testers.

“Server Security Misconfigurations like Lack of Security Headers, 
Insecure Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security 
(TLS) Cipher Suites, and Fingerprinting/Banner Disclosure continue 
to prevail in teams’ asset portfolios. Despite their reputation as low\-
risk issues, we recommend checking for these flaws and proactively 
addressing them before they enable a more dangerous chain exploit. 
To tackle the highest severity findings, we recommend reviewing 
your assets for the possibility of SQL Injections and Remote Code 
Executions, along with Using Default Credentials, Cross\-Site Scripting, 
and Insecure Direct Object References.

A large portion of teams in the US have been affected by layoffs, which 
in turn have compromised their security. More responsibilities and 
fewer resources have made workloads difficult to manage, and teams 
report larger backlogs of unaddressed security issues. While fewer in 
the UK and Germany said they were affected by layoffs, those who were 
reported similar struggles — overall, the global software and security 
ecosystem is at risk of one breach impacting many in a wide\-reaching 
domino effect. 

More often than not, pentests cause business disruptions. Teams can 
tackle this problem with a more strategic approach, where thorough 
preparation and collaborating closely with their pentest vendors can 
remove errors and significantly raise ROI without draining their budgets. 
You can find a preparation checklist on the next page.

Key Takeaways

There’s no sugarcoating it — security teams continue to face large\-scale challenges in 
keeping their organizations safe. And yet, it’s humbling to observe their resilience over the 
past 5 years with each State of Pentesting report. Whatever setback teams face, they find 
a way to adapt and move forward. We hope with this report practitioners can take away 
practical insights on how to strengthen their security posture and prepare effectively for 
each upcoming test. To summarize:

Pentest Preparation Checklist

Setting the pentest’s objective and scope (pg 21\)

1\) Align all internal stakeholders on what the goal of your pentest is and what assets should be in scope.

2\) Describe the in\-scope assets with information on endpoints, URLs, number of static and dynamic pages.

3\) Include information on the complexity of your asset, covering the questions we suggest on page 21\.

Familiarize the pentesters with how things are supposed to work (pg 22\)

4\) Decide if you want to have a black\-, gray\-, or white\-box pentest.

5\) If you want a gray\- or white\-box pentest, share documentation (walkthrough videos, demos, process diagrams, data flow charts, user role 
breakdowns, access control matrices) on how your asset(s) are built, how they are meant to function, where data flows, etc.

Methodology

Cobalt’s State of Pentesting report includes 
two types of data sets:

Anonymized pentest data collected 
via Cobalt’s proprietary Pentest as a 
Service platform (referred to later as 
“Cobalt’s Pentest Data”);

Survey responses from security teams, 
none of which are Cobalt customers 
(referred to later as “Survey Data”)

Cobalt’s Pentesting Data

Between January 1st 2022 and December 31st 2022, our Penetst as a Service (PtaaS) 
platform collected data from 3,195 pentests that covered multiple asset types:

•
•
•
•

Eric Galis Chief Information Security Officer at Cengage

“Cobalt for End\-to\-End Security 
Testing

Cobalt’s Pentest as a Service (PtaaS) platform is paired with an exclusive community of 
testers to deliver the real\-time insights you need to remediate risk quickly and innovate 
securely. The flexible, on\-demand consumption model enables security and development 
teams to proactively meet modern pentesting needs.

“

Datto’s pentesting program is evolving by using Agile 
Pentesting, as we’re able to schedule more pentests and 
allow ourselves to only look at the delta between the last 
pentest that was run and the newer pentest that would 
then occur. This gives us a better idea of what has already 
been tested and only focuses on the newer portions 
instead of always going to the same parts of the product 
that may not have changed over the course of a year, six 
months, or three months.”
