# Building long-term value by putting cyber at the heart of the business
2023
Global Future of Cyber Survey

2
No longer just an obligation or a collection of tech-focused hygiene practices, cyber has grown into a critical function for helping businesses deliver outcomes, and the results of Deloitte’s 2023 Future of Cyber Survey illuminate this. This year’s global survey—Deloitte’s largest cyber survey to date—polled leaders across industries in order to get a clearer picture of where cyber stands and where it is going. What we discovered is that cyber’s profile as an enabler is growing. Among organizations of all sizes, cyber is consistently earning a place on the agenda, becoming a focal point for business-critical initiatives and investment.

We are excited about the future of cyber, and I invite you to join us in exploring some of the key findings in this report. In addition to data derived from the survey results, the report also includes observations and insights taken directly from survey respondents, as well as additional Deloitte insights on cyber, cloud, and other technologies enabling the future of business.

Stay well,
Emily Mossburg,
Deloitte Global Cyber Leader

The answer is cyber
Today, we are seeing the emergence of powerful new attitudes when it comes to cyber. Leaders are looking at cyber through a sharp, new lens—one that reveals the inherent business value that can come by embedding cyber. Not only across the enterprise, but as a crucial part of a powerful growth strategy.

# VIEW FROM THE TOP
The future of cyber is coming into sharper focus as organizations worldwide begin to look beyond the tech-centric and threat focus toward the potential positive outcomes they can achieve by deeply integrating cyber thinking and cyber actions across their businesses.

The world is increasingly interconnected, bringing about new risks alongside the new growth opportunities. Digital technologies, exponential growth of data, and evolving business needs are expanding attack threat surfaces and bringing new challenges that elevate cyber as a strategic business issue. Collaboration across cyber, risk management, and business units is critical to neutralizing cyberthreats, protecting business value, and sustaining customer trust.

In recent years, many enterprise leaders were focusing on the continued transition to digital business processes, as well as their technology environments and the rapid evolution of the cyber threat landscape. In fact, managing hybrid IT and digital transformation have emerged as two of the greatest challenges businesses face—solidifying complexity as the new norm for the enterprise.[^1]

Today, a new reality is taking shape, based on Deloitte’s 2023 Global Future of Cyber Survey, which asked hundreds of leaders across industries and across the globe to share their views on cyber threats, enterprise activities, and the future. The survey included C-suite executives across the enterprise, as well as other senior leaders with responsibility for IT, security, and risk. This new reality is grounded by the following findings.

Cyber is evolving into a distinct functional area of the business, transcending its traditional IT roots and becoming an essential part of the framework for delivering business outcomes.

# Cyber beyond
## Relationship transformation
>“We’re starting to see a far more significant focus on cybersecurity as an enterprise business risk. Across the organization, there is a significant shift in partnership in viewing cybersecurity as a core ingredient of our transformation and not a side garnish or afterthought. We’re doing a lot in terms of embedding cyber—whether it’s DevSecOps or in product development—where we’re starting to co-create with the (internal) partners to make sure that we’re building things securely. It’s like cultural transformation.”

# VIEW FROM THE TOP
Looking ahead to 2023 and beyond, cyber is growing far beyond its technology roots. For many organizations, cyber now weaves more tightly into business operations, outcomes, and opportunities. Cyber is more than technology-focused. It is foundational. Among cyber decision-makers across an organization, it has become part of the structure of the business, an embedded element for supporting business ambitions.

Just as cyber threats shifted from an IT problem to a business problem, we also now see a shift in cyber strategies from IT to the business—ultimately to support strategic business objectives and growth. Cyber as a business priority is becoming more evident at the board level. In this year’s survey, 70% of respondents reported that cyber was on their board’s agenda on a regular basis, either monthly or quarterly. This clearly demonstrates that cyber has earned an important seat at the table where high-level, strategic business decisions are made. Organizations increasingly recognize the role cyber plays in enabling broad business success.

An overwhelming majority of survey respondents identified a strong connection between cyber and business impact—with 86% reporting that cyber initiatives made a significant, positive contribution on at least one key business priority. And most organizations are looking to build on that value proposition, with 58% planning to increase their cyber investment in the next year.

## Savvy boards
>“Boards clearly care about cybersecurity, and they will allocate resources at an impressive level. Boards are now educated enough to identify where is their competent security leadership and where is someone who’s buying their way out of the problem. And as they recognize the difference, it’s going to change the senior executives’ and board’s tolerance.”

# VIEW FROM THE TOP
Despite cyber’s potential as a business enabler, the ability to leverage it effectively can be inconsistent across organizations. Some organizations have emerged as clear leaders, defining a path to value for others to follow.

As part of this year’s survey, Deloitte identified high-performing, cyber-mature organizations based on their level of cyber planning, their engagement on cyber at the board level, and the level of strategic action they have taken on cyber. These organizations are fully implementing actions that are important for cyber hygiene, including: an operational and strategic plan, an action plan to continuously improve the organization’s information security, and a cyber risk program to monitor and track the security posture of partners and suppliers.

These organizations, especially, are making the connection between cyber efforts and business value. They are more likely to report that cyber initiatives made a positive impact to a large extent on:
*   Brand reputation
*   Customer and digital trust
*   Operational stability, including the supply chain and partner ecosystem
*   Revenue

Organizations with high cyber maturity also are more likely to report that cyber brings value to key business strategies—providing the organization with confidence to try new things, increasing business agility, and enabling efficiency. And they are more likely to report seeing very high value from the third-party cyber services that they engage.

## Moving the business forward
>“Projects, initiatives, business objectives can’t be met without thinking through information security and privacy impacts, and having that embedded into the appropriate processes. We’re brought in during the ideation phase as it relates to business components and aspects. Our strategy is 100% focused on supporting the business, recognizing that cyber and privacy do not exist without the business. We want to ensure that we are meaningfully contributing to moving the business forward, driving growth, and doing so in a manner that’s compliant and secure.”

# METHODOLOGY
## How we developed the insights
### Methodology
#### Headquarters locations of the organizations we surveyed
Deloitte designed its 2023 Global Future of Cyber Survey based on the complexity of today’s business and technology landscape, focusing on the needs of enterprise leaders who may recognize the importance of cyber yet struggle to harness its value. Deloitte based its research on a survey of more than 1,000 cyber decision-makers at the director level or higher (C-suite executives and C-suite direct reports), across 20 countries and limited to organizations with at least 1,000 employees and US$500 million in annual revenue.

To accurately capture the increased impact that cyber has on businesses today, we nearly doubled the sample size from the 2021 research, from almost 600 respondents to 1,110. Deloitte also conducted in-depth interviews with a number of senior cyber decision-makers across various industries and geographies, to glean more detailed insights and to help validate our observations. Our approach covered every aspect relevant to the future of cyber, from strategy to tactics to culture to technology implementation.

At the core of this research, we focused our intentions and efforts on:
*   Exploring how cyber has changed since Deloitte’s 2021 report
*   Applying a forward-thinking lens, to help bring the future of cyber into sharper focus
*   Understanding the business value and impact of cyber that organizations are experiencing, and the distinct actions leading organizations are taking to gain more value from cyber

# THE IMPERATIVE
By separating high-cyber-maturity organizations from their medium- and low-cyber-maturity counterparts, we can identify a distinct class of cyber leaders and more fully understand the extent to which cyber underpins business success and value.

Today, cyber means business, and it is difficult to overstate the importance of cyber as a foundational and integral business imperative. For any enterprise, the future of cyber will be shaped by the C-suite and the board’s commitment, and by the business value that the entire organization can envision with cyber. Altogether, the results of our research show a new dynamic emerging as the CISO and the rest of the C-suite, along with the board, work in partnership to lead the business and enable innovation—together.

Put another way, cyber should be embedded across the broader business strategy. It should be included in every functional area, as an essential ingredient for success—to drive continuous business value, not simply mitigate risks to IT.

## Demonstrating impact
>“Where we minimize risk, we can clearly articulate where and how we have made an impact and how we’ve allowed operations to continue in a smooth and effective way—especially relative to our business partners that in many cases have had either operational or integration challenges.”
>
>—CISO, Consumer Organization

In addition to providing essential context for how cyber has evolved over the past two years, we developed a view on cyber maturity to understand the business impact that leading organizations make when they adopt more mature cyber strategies.

## The future is cyber

# HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Both the 2021 survey and this latest survey asked respondents about their organizations’ digital transformation priorities—to help identify which technologies were important to the organization and would, therefore, need to be considered as part of future cyber strategies.

Compared to companies’ top two priorities in 2021, cloud moved from the #2 spot to the #1 spot, displacing data analytics. Operational technology/industrial control systems and artificial intelligence/cognitive computing remained in the top five, moving up slightly. Joining the top-5 list this year is newcomer 5G, reflecting the growing role of the standard in organizations’ business ambitions.

The continued importance of cloud brings with it the complex cyber considerations that are inherent in hosting data and applications off premises and often across various environments. While cloud—and cyber cloud—maturity varies considerably, findings in our recent Future of Cloud Survey suggest that many organizations are overcoming those concerns and achieving highly positive outcomes for risk-related cloud use cases. In fact, 83% of organizations say their cloud investments are driving positive outcomes in terms of mitigating business and regulatory risk.[^2] This is a positive signal regarding maturing cyber cloud capabilities, shared responsibility models, and data privacy programs being put into place.

Since our previous report in the last quarter of 2021, global industries have continued to navigate constant disruption on multiple fronts, while adjusting their priorities, business initiatives, and capabilities accordingly.

# THEN AND NOW
## The role of cyber
As part of our latest Global Future of Cyber survey, we asked about the role that cyber plays in each of these leading digital transformation initiatives. The results are clear: executives see cyber playing a crucial role for all digital transformation priorities, especially when it comes to cloud, data analytics, and 5G (Figure 1).

While digital priorities and emerging technologies have evolved, so too have the effects of cyber incidents on organizations we analyzed. Even as the organization’s focus shifts to the positive benefits and long-term business value that cyber readiness can bring, it is important to keep sight of cyber’s core ability to counter cyber threats, mitigating negative business consequences and risks.

# THEN AND NOW
## Insights on incidents and impact
The frequency of cyber incidents or breaches has been growing, with 91% of organizations reporting at least one, compared to 88% in the 2021 survey. A multitude of actors, sources, tools, and techniques are part of the cyber concerns for organizations. High-maturity organizations seem more concerned about cyber criminals and terrorists, as well as phishing, malware, and ransomware attacks. Low- and medium-maturity companies have greater concern about denial-of-service attacks. It is worth noting that organizations with low maturity report experiencing more significant cybersecurity events (Figure 2).

Organizations reporting at least one cyber incident or breach.

**91%**

### Figure 2: Number of significant cybersecurity events
(Precentage)

The figure shows a comparison of the number of significant cybersecurity events experienced by organizations with low, medium, and high cyber maturity. The categories are:
*   None
*   1-5 events
*   6-10 events
*   11-15 events
*   16 or above

The percentages for each category are shown for each maturity level, as well as the overall percentage. For example:
*   Low cyber maturity: None (29%), 1-5 events (38%), 6-10 events (17%), 11-15 events (9%), 16 or above (2%)
*   Medium cyber maturity: None (38%), 1-5 events (41%), 6-10 events (13%), 11-15 events (11%), 16 or above (4%)
*   High cyber maturity: None (45%), 1-5 events (31%), 6-10 events (8%), 11-15 events (4%), 16 or above (11%)
*   Overall: None (36%), 1-5 events (38%), 6-10 events (14%), 11-15 events (3%), 16 or above (9%)

13
# THEN AND NOW
Meanwhile, operational disruption continues to be the most significant impact of cyber incidents, although loss of revenue and loss of customer trust jumped in the rankings—to second and third place—with 56% of respondents reporting that they suffered related consequences to a moderate or large extent. One potential hypothesis in play here: Organizations with a higher level of maturity may view the impacts differently, as they have a deeper understanding of what is actually happening in their business. Less mature organizations may be evaluating theoretical impacts. Regardless, high-maturity organizations do appear to be reaping significantly more positive benefits from cyber initiatives—including improved brand reputation and trust, operational benefits, and financial benefits. Low- and medium-maturity groups seem more likely to gain benefits around brand reputation and improving trust, as opposed to other areas.

In the context of these significant impacts, the need for a risk-based cyber strategy—across the organization’s ecosystem of cyber strategies, solutions, and controls—is ever more important for the future of cyber. A zero trust architecture can enable modern enterprise environments by strengthening security posture, simplifying security management, and improving end-user experience. And the journey to zero trust requires a strategy aligned to business outcomes plus significant effort and planning, including addressing foundational cyber issues, automating manual processes, and planning for transformational changes to the security organization, the technology landscape, and the enterprise itself.[^3]

Respondents reporting that they suffered related consequences to a moderate or large extent.

**56%**

## More than zero
>A zero trust implementation is much more than a technological implementation, it is also a business and cultural transformation that is dependent on culture, communications, and awareness.
>
>A comprehensive zero trust implementation should address a number of elements, including governance (architecture and operations), enablers such as analytics and automation, and core domains such as identities, data, and devices.

### Figure 3: Feeling the pain
Cyber incidents and breaches are resulting in the following negative consequences for organizations

The figure shows a table of negative consequences resulting from cyber incidents and breaches, comparing the ranking in 2021 and 2023, as well as the percentage of respondents who selected each consequence in 2023. The consequences are:
*   Operational disruption (including supply chain/or partner ecosystem)
*   Loss of revenue
*   Loss of customer trust/negative brand impact
*   Reputational loss
*   Defunding of a strategic initiative
*   Loss of confidence in tech integrity
*   Negative talent recruitment/retention impact
*   Intellectual property theft
*   Drop in share price
*   Regulatory fines
*   Change in leadership

# WHY MATURITY MATTERS
## Understanding what it means to be cyber mature
In today’s environment of heightened cyber importance, we drew from our experience working with thousands of organizations worldwide to segment respondents according to their cyber maturity.

### Defining maturity
To define cyber maturity and identify the high performers who are shaping the future of cyber, we used three sets of leading practices to rate organizations:

*   Robust cyber planning, indicated by the presence of strategic, operational, and tactical plans to defend against and respond to cyber threats
*   Key cyber activities, such as qualitative and quantitative risk assessment, industry benchmarking, and incident-response scenario planning
*   Effective board engagement, exemplified by organizations whose boards address cyber-related issues on a regular basis

### A closer look at maturity groups
By assigning point values to each set of leading practices, we were able to segment the surveyed organizations into three groups:

*   Low cyber maturity organizations, adhering to none of the sets of leading practices **38%**
*   Medium cyber maturity organizations, adhering to 1 of the sets of leading practices **41%**
*   High cyber maturity organizations, adhering to 2–3 sets of leading practices **21%**

### Maturity at any size, in any industry
In looking across the three groups, we dug into their broader characteristics to identify any trends or traits for maturity. All three of the segments (low, medium, high) spanned industries as well as organization size and revenue—indicating that maturity level may not be significantly dependent on a company’s industry or size.

15
# WHY MATURITY MATTERS
While CISOs can serve as organizational champions for cyber, many of these leading practices only become possible through enterprisewide engagement.

That can take the form of:
*   Having a governing body that comprises IT and senior business leaders to oversee the cyber program
*   Conducting incident-response scenario planning and simulation at the organizational and/or board level
*   Regularly providing cyber updates to the board, to secure funding
*   Annual cyber awareness training among all employees

The high-maturity organizations that we identified recognize the effectiveness of distributing cyber responsibilities throughout the organization. Such efforts align with Deloitte’s common guidance of embedding cyber professionals within business units, or at least having someone in each business unit with a clear responsibility for coordinating with the cyber team. They are 31% less likely to cite inadequate governance across their organization as a top challenge in managing cyber (35% for low cyber maturity vs. 34% for medium cyber maturity vs. 22% for high cyber maturity).

Crucially, the three leading practices that we identified—cyber planning, activities, and board involvement—hinge on stakeholders recognizing the importance of cyber responsibility and engagement across the whole organization.

## Connecting maturity to value, for the entire enterprise
### Cyber planning strategies
A visual representation of the cyber planning strategies implemented across different industries is provided. The industries are:
*   Energy, Resources & Industrials
*   Government & Public Services
*   Technology, Media & Telecom
*   Financial Services
*   Consumer
*   Life Sciences & Health Care

The visual indicates whether each industry is "Slightly ahead of the pack", "Slightly behind", or "Behind" in terms of implementing cyber planning strategies.

### Cyber activities implemented
A visual representation of the cyber activities implemented across different industries is provided. The industries are:
*   Energy, Resources & Industrials
*   Government & Public Services
*   Technology, Media & Telecom
*   Financial Services
*   Consumer
*   Life Sciences & Health Care

The visual indicates whether each industry is "Slightly ahead of the pack", "Slightly behind", or "Behind" in terms of implementing cyber activities.

16
# WHY MATURITY MATTERS
### Industry
Of the six industries included in this study, three of them have five or more cyber activities implemented—slightly higher than the overall average. Those three industries include government/public services (GPS); energy/resources/industrials (ERI); and technology/media/telecom (TMT).

Two industries (ERI and life sciences/health care) have five or more cyber planning strategies implemented, at a level slightly higher than the overall average.

Meanwhile, the financial services industry is implementing four out of eight cyber planning strategies at levels slightly higher than the overall average. That industry, however, is behind the overall average when it comes to cyber activities, with only one activity rising above the overall average.

And our data showed that the consumer industry is slightly behind other industries and the overall average, with seven out of the ten key cyber activities, slightly behind the overall average, and with all of the cyber planning strategies being implemented at levels below the overall average.

### Organization size
The research also indicated that companies with 20,000 or more employees are more likely to:
*   Understand the importance of business strategies around risk management, digital transformation, digital trust, and technology modernization.
*   Recognize the importance of cyber in these business strategies.
*   Engage in cyber planning and implementing key cyber activities.

### The bottom line
Any organization, regardless of industry or size, can move toward high cyber performance and maturity. Success should not depend solely on your ability to “buy” maturity through increased investments in cyber. Rather, the actions that you take and the culture that you build will be primary factors for improving performance.

The survey defined small companies as those with revenue of US$500 million to US$1 billion. Large companies included organizations with US$10 billion or more in revenue.

### Figure 4: Where industries stand
#### Examples of cyber planning strategies
*   Analyzes and updates cyber plans annually
*   Has a governing body composed of senior business and IT leaders, to oversee the cyber program
*   Employs risk quantification tools to measure and ensure the return on cyber investments
*   Conducts incident-response scenario planning at the organizational and/or board level
*   Gets external help/outsourcing to manage cyber initiatives

#### Examples of cyber activities
*   Annual cyber awareness training among all employees
*   A cyber incident-response plan that gets updated and tested annually
*   Comprehensive plan to assess how to protect data at each step, as to where data is stored, processed, and transmitted
*   Cyber risk program to monitor and track the security posture of partners and suppliers
*   Ongoing “voice of the customer” input for cyber and data privacy preferences

A visual representation is provided, showing the impact of cyber on businesses initiatives across different maturity levels. The impacts are:
*   Enhances trust
*   Enable efficiency
*   Detects potential problems sooner
*   Improves resilience
*   Increase agility
*   Prevents bad things from happening
*   Provides confidence to try new things

The percentages for each impact are shown for low, medium, and high cyber maturity organizations. For example, for "Enhances trust":
*   Low cyber maturity: 38%
*   Medium cyber maturity: 50%
*   High cyber maturity: 65%

# WHY MATURITY MATTERS
## Bolstering the business with cyber
### Building a bigger business case for cyber
Regardless of an organization’s maturity, there is no cyber architecture or approach that can guarantee absolute security and risk mitigation. Instead, the most striking feature of highly cyber-mature organizations is their ability to extract value from their cyber investments.

High performers are doing more when it comes to engaging leadership, planning, and acting—and it appears to be generating more business value from their cyber efforts. In terms of seeing impacts like increased efficiency, resiliency, and agility, those highly mature organizations are ahead of the pack, and they are recognizing benefits that may not be typically associated with cyber.

### Generating confidence and much more
More than half of these leaders (55%) reported that cyber provides them with confidence to try new things—compared to 45% for medium-maturity organizations and 40% for low-maturity organizations. And nearly 70% of highly mature organizations said cyber was making an impact on both enhancing trust and enabling efficiency—significantly higher than the low- and medium-maturity organizations.

Likewise, a majority of highly mature leaders (65%) also cited resilience and agility as benefits of cyber—once again far ahead of their low-maturity and medium-maturity peers (Figure 5).

Highly mature organizations said cyber provides them with confidence to try new things.

**55%**

### Figure 5: Recognizing the bigger potential
#### Where cyber is making a specific impact on businesses initiatives
(Percentage)

The figure shows a comparison of the positive contributions of cyber initiatives across different maturity levels. The areas are:
*   Improved brand reputation
*   Improved digital trust (for customers and employees)
*   Improved customer trust/brand impact
*   Improved confidence in tech integrity
*   Increased talent recruitment/retention impact
*   Built long term sustainability
*   Improved operational stability including supply chain/or partner ecosystem
*   Increased resiliency
*   Improved agility
*   Minimized Intellectual property theft
*   Increased revenue
*   Increased funding of a strategic initiative
*   Avoid regulatory fines
*   Increase in share price

The percentages for each area are shown for low, medium, and high cyber maturity organizations. For example, for "Improved brand reputation":
*   Low cyber maturity: 29%
*   Medium cyber maturity: 36%
*   High cyber maturity: 64%

18
# WHY MATURITY MATTERS
The highest-performing organizations also were more likely to report positive contributions from their cyber initiatives in areas such as improved brand reputation (64%), increased revenue (47%), improved operational stability involving the supply chain and partner ecosystem (59%), talent recruitment and retention (49%), long-term sustainability (64%), improved customer trust and brand impact (62%).

Trust is an issue of paramount importance when it comes to cyber. As an “ecosystem” that can help deliver outcomes, trust needs to be built with all of your human stakeholders. A trusting workforce, for example, achieves 2x improved customer satisfaction, and customers who trust a brand are 88% more likely to buy again.[^4] Building customer trust also affects partners and improves up to 4x market capitalization, with trusted companies ultimately outperforming their peers by up to 400%.

And based on the data from our 2023 Global Future of Cyber Survey, global organizations can clearly see the connection to benefits including trust. While organizations that are investing in cyber are seeing significant gains across a range of value measures, the highest performers get more of that value across every strategic measure (Figure 6).

Building customer trust affects partners and improves market capitalization, with trusted companies ultimately outperforming their peers.

**400%**

### Figure 6: Reaping real benefits
#### Cyber initiatives are making a positive contribution in the following areas
(Percentage)

The figure shows a comparison of the value derived from third-party cyber services across different maturity levels. The areas are:
*   Cyber strategy
*   Data protection and privacy
*   Cyber cloud
*   Infrastructure security
*   Application security
*   Emerging technologies (OT, 5G, AI, Quantum computing)
*   Identity and access management
*   Detect & Respond
*   Recover & Transform

The percentages for each area are shown for low, medium, and high cyber maturity organizations. For example, for "Cyber strategy":
*   Low cyber maturity: 31%
*   Medium cyber maturity: 35%
*   High cyber maturity: 55%

## Customer expectations

19
# WHY MATURITY MATTERS
One other area in which highly mature cyber organizations exceeded their peers in the low and medium group: the value they are seeing from using third-party cyber services.

A majority of these high performers reported measurable value when it came to third-party services for cyber strategy, data protection and privacy, cyber cloud, infrastructure security, and application security. Meanwhile, a minority of low- and medium-maturity companies reported value across those areas.

Importantly, to take advantage of the value that third-party cyber services can bring, organizations should consider ways they can manage their growing services ecosystems and the inherent complexity (Figure 7).

## Lessons to learn:
### Following the leaders
Given the ability of these high-performing organizations to extract significant business wide benefits from their cyber investments, other organizations should look to the example set by cyber-mature companies—using it as a set of guideposts for achieving broader enterprise engagement on cyber.

Based on the success that these high-maturity organizations have derived from cyber, it may be time for your business to take a deeper dive into questions such as:
*   Do we have the right technology and partner ecosystem in place—and how can we manage a growing, complex network of third parties?
*   Are we investing in the right ways and in the right areas—and do we have the right framework in place to understand how and where cyber is adding value across the organization?
*   Are we investing in the right ways and in the right areas—and do we have the right “value frame” in place to understand how and where cyber is adding value across the organization?

### Figure 7: Getting value with vendors
#### Where companies are reporting seeing value from third-party cyber services
(Percentage)

The figure shows a comparison of the value derived from third-party cyber services across different maturity levels. The areas are:
*   Cloud
*   Data analytics
*   5G
*   Internet of Things
*   Artificial Intelligence/cognitive computing

The percentages for each area are shown for low, medium, and high cyber maturity organizations. For example, for "Cloud":
*   Low cyber maturity: 42%
*   Medium cyber maturity: 48%
*   High cyber maturity: 66%

## Key insights to shape the future of cyber: Five areas of focus
### Multidirectional engagement
As we have already noted, high-performing organizations engage the entire organization in cyber activities. While high-maturity organizations, by definition, leverage more cyber leading practices than their medium- and low-maturity counterparts, the disparities in organizational engagement are among the starkest.

*   **Leadership.** High-maturity organizations are nearly three times as likely as low-maturity organizations, and nearly twice as likely as medium-maturity organizations, to have a governing body comprising senior business and IT leaders, to oversee their cyber programs (60% high vs. 36% medium, 22% low).
*   **Scenario planning.** Similarly, high-maturity organizations are three times as likely as low-maturity organizations, and twice as likely as medium-maturity organizations, to conduct incident-response scenario planning at the organizational and/or board level (60% high vs. 30% medium, 20% low).

### Criticality to digital transformation initiatives
High-maturity organizations are much more likely to value cyber as central to key digital transformation priorities (Figure 8).

Adoption of these digital transformation priorities is essential to ensuring operational agility and business success. But each carries significant cyber risks, and high-maturity organizations may be especially attuned to that reality.

For example, AI can be an enabler of cyber strategies and companies’ digital business ambitions, but it also introduces the potential for cyber risk that can come with any digital technology. Beyond the leading practices we have highlighted here, our recent State of AI in the Enterprise survey report also underscores how engaging in specific risk-mitigation steps can also help drive better outcomes, such as cost reduction and entry into new markets. AI-related risks represent an issue of high importance to organizations. It also found explainability and transparency in AI decisions, data privacy or consent mismanagement, and safety concerns about AI systems, among others, all loom large as ethical risks that concern organizations.[^5]

Managing these risks can have a major impact on an organization’s AI efforts. In fact, the AI survey found that 50% of respondents cited management of AI-related risks as one of the top inhibitors to scaling AI projects. Despite such sentiments, only 33% of respondents have aligned their AI risk management with their organization’s broader risk management efforts. However, 33% of high-outcome surveyed organizations and 29% of low-outcome surveyed organizations do engage outside vendors to independently audit their AI systems.
