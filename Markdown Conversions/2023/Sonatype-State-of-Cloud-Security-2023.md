9TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN REPORT

# Introduction

In today’s fast-paced world, the pursuit of excel-
lence is a relentless journey. We all understand 
the signiﬁcance of innovation, efciency, and 
the individuals at the core of it all: developers. 
From our past eight State of the Software Sup-
ply Chain reports, we know that developer pro-
ductivity soars when they have access to supe-
rior tools and better open source components, 
making them the driving force behind better 
security and better products.

But what exactly does “better” mean in the 
ever-expanding landscape of technology 
choices? This question, in part, is the reason 
we’ve been studying the software supply chain 
for the last nine years. As we deliver the 9th 
version of this State of the Software Supply 
Chain report, that question is more paramount 
than ever. As we explore how to make “better” 
software, it’s not just about the introduction 
of AI or cutting-edge technologies; it’s about 
addressing fundamental issues that, in many 
ways, have not changed in nine years. It’s about 
the often-overlooked, yet vital, element that lies 
within our software supply chain: open source 
consumption behavior.

We aim to sift through the labyrinthine market 
of software components, not to add to the 
cacophony of choices but to streamline it. Why? 
Because choice is a double-edged sword. 
The consequences of choosing poorly are 
far-reaching. 

Consider this — last year, we revealed that a 
staggering 85% of projects in Maven Central 
— the largest public repository for Java open 
source components — are inactive. In other 
words, developers are faced with a perplexing 
array of choices, with only a fraction of them 
leading to active, well-maintained projects. Yet, 
we also found, and re-afrmed this year, that 
96% of all vulnerable downloads from Maven 
Central, had known ﬁxes available. There are so 
many choices to make, and only with the right 
tools, the right automation, can developers truly 
be set up for success. 

As we dissect the intricacies of open source 
adoption and consumption, we validate a frus-
trating truth — development practices remain 
rife with inconsistency. When choices are 
made poorly, this inconsistency translates into 
increased risks, discontent among developers, 
and, perhaps most signiﬁcantly, a loss of both 
time and money.  

The State of the Software Supply Chain report 
each year isn’t just a cautionary tale, but a call 
to action. It is a response to the pressing need 
to redeﬁne our priorities and a testament to our 
willingness to evolve. We ﬁnd ourselves in a 
period of revolution. Modernization is our ally. 
With regulations a focus in nearly every region, 
an uncertain economic climate demanding cost 
savings and efciencies, and malicious activity 
more prominent than ever, it’s time for change. 
In the following pages, we provide you with an 
in-depth update on open source usage trends 
and security practices. We continue to draw 
from public and proprietary data sources to 
illustrate a host of issues with efective supply 
chain management. We’ll look at:

▷Ongoing growth of the software supply chain, 
as well as persistent security concerns

▷The advantages of using well-maintained open 
source packages 

▷Open source consumption and trends in 
upgrade urgency of components 

▷Peer insights into the use of SBOMs and 
mature software supply chain management

▷The rise of open source and software supply 
chain regulations

▷What role AI and ML play in assisting develop-
ers, and the challenges that AI practitioners 
face in developing AI products

We also look at what it really means to have a 
Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and a Soft-
ware Composition Analysis (SCA) program, and 
ultimately shed light on the path to a more ef-
cient, cost-efective, and secure development.

9TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN REPORT

## C H A P T E R 1 : O P E N S O U R C E S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D

A monk by the name of John of Salisbury wrote 
a famous phrase in a 12th century manuscript, 
borrowed by Sir Isaac Newton and hundreds of 
others since:

“We are like dwarfs sitting on the shoulders of 
giants. We see more, and things that are more 
distant, than they did, not because our sight is 
superior or because we are taller than they, but 
because they raise us up, and by their great 
stature add to ours.”

The meaning of the passage is simple: The 
progress we make only happens because of the 
progress in learning and understanding others 
have made before us. 

Nowhere else is this seen more than in the 
adoption of open source. Nearly all of the soft-
ware shipped today relies on previous innova-
tion that is distributed freely on scafolding built 
by the utmost experts in the world, available to 
all developers free of charge. 

In past State of the Software Supply Chain 
reports, we’ve estimated that up to 90% of the 
code we run in production is of open source 
origin. Therefore, the economics of open source 
are good indicators of trends and challenges in 
the wider software market. 

For the 9th consecutive year, we continue to 
track the growth of open source adoption across 
the top four major open source ecosystems. 
These collectively account for four of the top ﬁve 
languages in GitHub, and a 60% share of the 
most popular programming languages accord-
ing to PYPL Language popularity index1. 

Leveraging our continued monitoring, we pres-
ent the combined statistics of each ecosystem in 
the table below.

### Open source supply sees a resurgence

The supply side of open source is an interesting 
metric to gauge the pace and scale of innovation 
that occurs in a given ecosystem. The more open 
source projects are published every year, the 
more innovation occurs in a given ecosystem.

New open source projects across the monitored 
ecosystems have been published at a relatively 
steady 15% average rate5 in recent years, which 
was a signiﬁcant reduction in pace from highs 
seen in 2019 and before. 

**FIGURE 1.2 OPEN SOURCE NEW PROJECT GROWTH RATE OVER THE PAST 4 YEARS**

**FIGURE 1.3 OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS AND VERSIONS GROWTH**

*5 In the 2021 report, we used a diferent method of estimating project counts for NuGet which resulted in a reduced number of projects being reported in 2022. We have corrected the NuGet historic numbers based on statistics published by the NuGet Gallery.*

This two-year slump is most likely related to 
the COVID-19 pandemic period and associated 
slowdown. While some studies suggest produc-
tivity did increase during the 2020-2023 period 
in the U.S., a negative correlation emerges in 
open source production trends. This is further 
supported by another study that found produc-
tivity rates in information and communication 
technology did decline towards 2022. One 
other explanation could be that a lot of these 
projects are in fact coming from commercial 
activity and not people with spare time, which 
was in abundance during the pandemic.

To date, the data in 2023 shows the innovation 
slowdown is now over. Each monitored ecosys-
tem showed a remarkably consistent project 
growth rate, varying just 2% across all four 
monitored ecosystems to a total average growth 
rate of 29% year-over-year.

The rate of production growth is recovering 
across the board, and both Maven Central and 
NuGet are on track to exceed the rate of growth 
seen in 2020. 

PyPi and npm, although growing, have not yet 
caught up to their original rate of growth but are 
on an upward trend. In a later section, we will 
see how breakthroughs and interest in AI and its 
related tooling are fueling the rate of growth in 
these ecosystems.

Between 2022 and 2023, the number of avail-
able open source projects grew an average 
of 29%. The average open source project in 
2023 has released 15 versions available for 
consumption, with speciﬁc ecosystem averages 
ranging from 10 to 22 across the diferent open 
source registries. That means 1-2 new versions 
every month and adds up to 60 million com-
bined releases made available in the observed 
ecosystems.

### Open source consumption is decelerating

While we’re seeing supply increase, consump-
tion isn’t keeping pace. The rate of download 
growth in open source consumption has slowed 
the past two years. In 2023, this trend continued 
with the average download growth rate sitting at 
33%, which is exactly what it was last year. This 
is a stark comparison to the all-time high of 2021, 
which saw 73% year-over-year growth. There 
is a sign of slowdown in growth in the largest 
ecosystems, which is not surprising given the 
market saturation they already have.

Despite this, both of the largest ecosystems, 
Maven and npm, are each estimated to reach 
over a trillion requests in 2023, with npm reach-
ing a staggering 2.6 trillion requests in total, con-
tinuing a modest growth that surpasses the total 
request rate of PyPI in 2022.

These two ecosystems account for 90% of the 
requests served with the remaining two growing 
at above average pace.

**FIGURE 1.4 CUMULATIVE ESTIMATED REQUESTS PER ECOSYSTEM OVER 6 YEARS**

Requests are the fundamental measure of 
how popular an open source ecosystem is and 
how lively its usage is. Other factors within an 
ecosystem may vary, such as the larger size 
and complexity of Java packages compared to 
JavaScript packages.

Investigating the rate of growth for requests 
can reveal information about the state of open 
source adoption, as well as the growth of the 
software industry at large.

Figure 1.5 charts these individual growth rates 
over time and displays an average across all 4 
ecosystems. 

Download requests for all open source ecosys-
tems are still growing, but for a third year in a 
row there are signs that the pace of growth is 
slowing down. 

We can see a clear delineation between the 
stabilization of large ecosystems like Maven and 
npm, and continued accelerated growth in PyPI 
and NuGet. 

Figure 1.6 charts the overall aggregate request 
growth across all ecosystems. It illustrates that 
although the pace of growth is slowing down, 
the absolute scale of growth continues to com-
pound on previous years’ rates. To put it simply, 
the pace of open source adoption still shows no 
signs of stopping.

### Individual ecosystem analysis

#### Java (Maven)

Through the ﬁrst 7 months of 2023, 512 billion Java 
components were requested from the Maven Cen-
tral Repository. This is a signiﬁcant jump compared 
to the 821 billion requests in 2022.

Java continues to grow at a healthy pace, hitting 
an estimated 25% YoY request growth rate. If 
previous years are any indication, we may well 
see a spike towards the end of the year.

#### JavaScript (npmjs)

npm is the juggernaut of open source registries, 
with an estimated download request count of 
over 2.6 trillion components (or to display it in 
full numbers: 2,579,310,885,518). 

The growth of npm is the slowest of all the mon-
itored ecosystems — estimated to be at 18% 
YoY. Nevertheless, owing to npm’s substantial 
footprint, this translates to a staggering 400 bil-
lion requests, surpassing the combined total of 
requests served by PyPI and NuGet.

#### Python (PyPI)

Python continues to expand at a high pace, 
fueled by the language’s popularity and innova-
tive uses, including AI. In 2023, PyPI served over 
178 billion requests. This year, we estimate PyPI 
request volume will hit 261 billion packages. This 
represents 31% YoY growth.

#### .NET (NuGet)

NuGet is the chosen ecosystem of the .NET 
family of languages and continues to serve engi-
neers working with the growing set of Microsoft 
technologies. The rate of growth in NuGet is 
estimated to be the fastest amongst the cohort. 
Developers downloaded 113 billion NuGet pack-
ages in 2022, which was well above our estimate 
last year. In 2023, NuGet is estimated to serve 162 
billion requests, representing 43% YoY growth.

### Open source software security concerns see no sign of slowing

In 2022, we reported a massive increase in the 
growth of malicious attacks on the software 
supply chain. Since our last report, this method 
of propagating security threats using trusted 
developer utilities and ecosystems has contin-
ued to evolve and ﬂourish. 

A troubling trend has emerged in the soft-
ware supply chain over the past few years 
of tailor-made packages designed to run a 
malicious payload on download — without any 
developer interaction. This form of intrusion 
relies on developers not recognizing that the 
build breakage resulting from the fake package 
might be an indication that something nefarious 
has already happened on their system. We did a 
deep dive into types of malicious attacks in last 
year’s report.

11

9TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN REPORT

## C H A P T E R 1 : O P E N S O U R C E S U P P LY A N D D E M A N D

In our YoY monitoring, at the time of writing in 
September 2023, we have logged 245,032 
malicious packages — meaning in the last year, 
we’ve seen the number of malicious packages 
tripled. Looking at it a diferent way, it also indi-
cates that in one year alone, we’ve seen twice 
as many supply chain attacks as the cumulative 
numbers in previous years 

This pace of growth is astonishing. It signals 
the role of the supply chain as one of the fast-
est growing vectors for adversaries to execute 
malicious code. Furthermore, we have seen an 
increase in nation-state actors leveraging these 
vectors (see our deep dive section below).

This is alarming news. Even though many open 
source ecosystems have implemented new 
security policies, such as mandatory MFA, they 
usually only address the issue of protecting 
existing open source publishers from attack. 
Often, packages containing malicious code 
are treated very similarly to packages with new 
security vulnerabilities — and they are taken 
down entirely based on a volunteer efort follow-
ing a vulnerability removal process, which is not 
appropriate when the code is designed to be 
malicious from the start. This approach can lead 
to the malicious packages being up longer than 
necessary, leaving developers at risk.

### Notable malicious packages and vulnerabilities

As we continue to document an overall rise in 
malicious attacks on open source ecosystems, 
the monitored 2022-2023 period has also seen 
more professional criminal campaigns emerge. 
The software supply chain lends itself well to the 
cybercriminal ecosystem — either as an initial 
access vector to Initial Access brokers or even 
as a means of distributing initial access malware 
for Advanced Persistent Threat groups. Here are 
several examples we’ve seen this year:

#### Lazarus created PyPI package ‘VMConnect’ imitates VMware vSphere connector

In August 2023, Sonatype discovered a mali-
cious Python package, ‘VMConnect,’ on PyPI, 
which mimics a legitimate VMware module. This 
is part of a wider cyber campaign called “Paper-
Pin,” and is widely thought to originate from the 
Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-afliated 
organization. The packages aim to download 
further malicious payloads from attacker-con-
trolled URLs. The focus on VMware, a wide-
ly-used virtualization platform, is particularly 
concerning, as a successful compromise could 
have far-reaching implications for enterprise 
networks and is widely attractive to state afli-
ated actors. Read our full deep dive

**FIGURE 1.7 NEXT GENERATION SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS (2019-2023)**

#### ChatGPT histories were uncovered due to a vulnerability in Redis component used by OpenAI

In March of 2023, ChatGPT users experienced 
a data leak where chat histories displayed other 
people’s queries. OpenAI identiﬁed the issue 
as a race condition vulnerability in an open 
source component called Redis, which they use 
for caching user data. This ﬂaw made sensitive 
data of about 1.2% of ChatGPT Plus subscribers 
accessible to others. The vulnerability was exac-
erbated by a recent server change that increased 
the probability of the race condition occurring. 
The issue underscores the importance of even 
rarely occurring vulnerabilities, especially in 
widely-used components like Redis, given their 
potential to cause widespread disruption and 
data exposure. Read our full analysis.

#### PyTorch namespace confusion attack targets utilities aimed at AI developers

In the past couple of holiday seasons, we’ve 
seen some big supply chain attacks, including 
one on PyTorch, a popular machine learning 
framework. The attackers used a tactic known 
as namespace confusion to speciﬁcally go after 
the experimental “nightly” build of PyTorch. They 
managed to steal sensitive data, signaling that 
hackers are increasingly setting their sights on 
AI and machine learning tools. These tools are 
becoming more critical in various sectors, mak-
ing them attractive targets. While only the exper-
imental build was hit, the incident serves as a 
wake-up call for better security in the booming 
AI ﬁeld. Read our full analysis.

#### A timeline of attacks

We have continued to curate a timeline of 
known malicious packages and malware cam-
paigns. This interactive timeline summarizes 
notable supply chain incidents, next-gen attacks 
and other incidents propagated using the soft-
ware supply chain.

### Differentiating software vulnerabilities and malware

Up until now, we’ve been talking about malware 
and malicious attacks on the software supply 
chain - or maybe better stated as malware prop-
agated using the open source supply chain. In 
this next section, we’re going to discuss soft-
ware vulnerabilities. While the two concepts are 
related, they are very distinct, so we’d like to 
quickly deﬁne the diference between a vulnera-
bility and a malware.

#### Software vulnerability: A flaw in the code

A software vulnerability is akin to a ﬂaw in code, 
much like a faulty lock on a door. However, 
unlike malware, vulnerabilities are not inten-
tional. Instead, they represent weaknesses in 
software components or projects.

Similar to how a faulty lock compromises the 
security of a building by allowing unauthorized 
access, a software vulnerability creates a gap 
in the software’s security perimeter. This gap 
becomes an entry point for intruders to exploit, 
gaining unapproved access to the system, appli-
cation, or component.

#### Malware: Malicious intent in open source

Malware, short for “malicious software,” poses a 
signiﬁcant threat to open source software eco-
systems. It encompasses a wide range of mali-
cious programs, such as viruses, worms, trojans, 
ransomware, spyware, and adware, all designed 
to gain unauthorized access to information or 
systems.

With its various forms, malware’s primary pur-
pose is to steal data, install harmful software, 
gain control of a network, or compromise soft-
ware or hardware. Threat actors employ diverse 
distribution methods, such as infected email 
attachments, malicious websites, or compro-
mised software downloads.

### Consumption behavior contributing to security concerns

Our report last year revealed a startling statistic — 
nearly 96% of component downloads with known 
vulnerabilities could be avoided as a better, ﬁxed 
version is already available. This illustrates a clear 
need for organizations to pay closer attention to 
what versions they are adopting.

**FIGURE 1.8 SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS, DEC 2021–AUGUST 2023**

There is widening evidence that whatever the 
standard practice for avoiding vulnerable com-
ponents today, the controls are not having the 
efect needed to reduce the attack surface. For 
example, as of September 2023, downloads vul-
nerable to the infamous Log4Shell vulnerability 
still account for nearly a quarter of all net new 
downloads of Log4j. It should be highlighted, 
that almost two years after the initial ﬁnding of 
this vulnerability, we’re seeing this pace con-
tinue every week — that a quarter of all down-
loads are of the vulnerable version of Log4j. 
This is only part of the story. The reality is, nearly 
1/3 of all Log4j downloads, ever, are of the vul-
nerable version. 

As we discussed last year, the numbers for other 
critical vulnerabilities that have not received 
as much widespread media attention are even 
more depressing.

This warrants concern and calls for behavioral 
adaptation at organizations because critical vul-
nerabilities are widely exploited by bad actors, 
even at the state level. For example, Log4S-
hell has topped CISA/NSA charts for active 
state-sponsored exploitation for well over a 
year now. This is also echoed in the OpenSSF’s 
recently released Consumption Manifesto, 
which calls for organizations to take respon-
sibility for the open source they use, how it is 
consumed, and how they manage the risk asso-
ciated with that consumption.

According to a joint consortium of national oper-
ators including CISA, NSA, NCSC-UK and oth-
ers, attackers are exploiting older well-known 
vulnerabilities much more frequently than new 
zero-day vulnerabilities. This is extremely 
important to understand. While we should of 
course worry about zero-days, we also know 
that 96% of vulnerable open source downloads 
have a non-vulnerable ﬁx available. Those 96% 
need to be addressed. 

For this year’s report, we’ve taken a closer look 
at how vulnerabilities are consumed from Maven 
Central, with a special focus on what sort of geo-
graphic variance might exist.

#### Vulnerable components consumed

Let’s start of by looking at the top level. In 2022 
we saw 12% of downloads served by Maven 
Central6, contained at least one known security 
vulnerability. 

This number is important when considering that 
the easiest way to reduce risk of a supply chain 
incident caused by a vulnerability is to simply 
choose a better, non-vulnerable version of a 
component.7 There is some improvement  in 
these however, the number of vulnerable down-
loads in 2021 was 14% — and the number to date 
in 2023 sits at around 10%.

*6 Countries and regions with over 100,000 annual requests*

*7 A limitation in this report is that the numbers reported are of security vulnerabilities known as of August 2023, even when inspecting retrospectively. The amount of vulnerabilities known at the time of download might have been lower, which might partially explain the improvement over time.*

However, when investigating the downloads 
that contained a vulnerability in 2022, it 
emerges well over a third of the components 
consumed that had known vulnerabilities were 
Critical8 in severity — and a further 30.
