Introduction
Privacy continues to increase in importance for organizations around the world and 
those they serve. Data privacy remains mission critical and an attractive investment 
for organizations as reflected in its integration into business priorities and processes, 
economic value, and visibility to senior management and the Board of Directors. Yet, 
organizations’ priorities regarding the use of personal data are not fully aligned to 
those of consumers, especially when it comes to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 
automation to make decisions that affect the individual. This report, our sixth annual 
review of key privacy challenges for organizations, examines privacy’s impact on 
organizations around the world.

Methodology
The data in this study is derived from the 
Cisco Security Outcomes survey in which 
respondents were anonymous to the 
researchers and not informed who was 
conducting the study. Using the same 
methodology as prior years, more than 4700 
security professionals from 26 geographies1 
completed the survey in Summer 2022\. Survey 
respondents represent major industries and 
a mix of company sizes. (See Appendix) We 
directed privacy specific questions to the 
more than 3100 respondents who indicated 
they are familiar with the data privacy program 
at their organizations. In this report, we also 
included relevant results from the Cisco 
2022 Consumer Privacy Survey2, which was 
completed in Summer 2022 by 2600 adults in 
12 geographies.

Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, 
Mexico, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, 
Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, The Netherlands, UK, US, and Vietnam.

Key findings: 

1\. Privacy continues to be an attractive 
investment for organizations globally, 
even in a difficult economic climate, 
delivering higher average benefits 
across the board, and a strong 1\.8 
times return on investment.

2\. Nearly all organizations have 
integrated privacy into their 
priorities and processes with 98% 
of respondents reporting privacy\-
related metrics to their Board of 
Directors and 95% saying “all of their 
employees” need to know how to 
protect data privacy. 

3\. Organizations are not fully in sync 
with consumers when it comes to 
building trust — especially in the 
use of their personal data for AI and 
automated decision\-making.

4\. Organizations are recognizing 

that global providers, operating at 
scale, can better protect their data 
compared to local providers.

Privacy continued to be a critical business driver for organizations around the world in 2022, 
with the vast majority of survey respondents confirming the value and importance of privacy. 
Ninety\-five percent (95%) of respondents said privacy is a business imperative, up from 90% 
last year. Ninety\-four percent (94%) said their customers would not buy from them if their 
data was not properly protected, up from 90% a year ago. And 95% said privacy is an integral 
part of their organizations’ culture, up from 92%. See Figure 1\.

“An organization’s approach to privacy impacts more than compliance. Investment in privacy drives business value across sales, security, operations, and most importantly, trust.” Dev Stahlkopf, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, CiscoDespite a difficult economic environment in 2022, privacy spending did not decrease, and in 
some cases, grew in 2022\. The average spending was $2\.7 Million, up significantly from $1\.2 
Million just 3 years ago. The most significant growth from 2021 to 2022 occurred at smaller 
organizations: spending at organizations with 50\-249 employees increased more than 17% to 
$2\.0 Million from $1\.7 Million. At organizations with 500\-999 employees, spending rose more 
than 13% to $2\.6 Million from $2\.3 Million. Spending at larger organizations remained relatively 
unchanged after steep increases from 2019 to 2020\. See Figure 2\.

At the same time, the estimated dollar value of benefits from privacy were up significantly this 
year. The average estimate rose more than 13% to $3\.4 Million from $3\.0 Million last year with 
significant gains across the various organization sizes. Benefits at organizations with 50\-249 
employees rose 35% to $2\.7 Million from $2\.0 Million, and those with 500\-999 employees rose 
18% to $3\.3 Million from $2\.8 Million. Estimated benefits at larger organizations of 1000\-9999 
employees and 10,000\+ employees also rose 6% and 8% respectively as shown in Figure 3\.

Putting spending and the estimated dollar value of the benefits together, privacy remains a 
very attractive financial investment for most organizations. The average organization is getting 
benefits estimated to be 1\.8 times spending, as it was in last year’s survey. Thirty\-six percent 
(36%) of organizations, up from 32% last year, are getting returns at least twice their spending 
with many realizing returns upwards of 3 to 5 times their investment. See Figure 4\.

including reducing sales delays, mitigating losses from data breaches, enabling innovation, 
achieving operational efficiency, building trust with customers, and making their company more 
attractive. Among this year’s respondents, over 70% indicated they were getting “significant” or 
“very significant” benefits from each of these areas. The average across the six areas was 74%, 
representing a significant increase from the 40% average response in our first survey from 2018 
and up 6% from last year. See Figure 5\.

With privacy as a critical business priority, more organizations are recognizing that everyone 
across their organization plays a vital role in protecting personal data. In this year’s survey, 95% 
of respondents said that “all of their employees” need to know how to protect data privacy. 

Additionally, privacy skills are particularly critical among those who are directly responsible for 
keeping data safe. The security professionals who completed our survey were asked to define 
their top 3 areas of responsibility: One\-third (33%) of these respondents selected “Data Privacy 
and Governance,” ranking only behind “Risk Assessment and Management” (44%) and “CISO 
or Security Leadership” (35%). See Figure 6\.

All rights reserved.This data shows that organizations recognize the need for privacy skills among all employees 
and with specific competencies for security teams to ensure that those who are authorized to 
access and work with the data will handle it appropriately. Interestingly, this percentage was 
quite consistent across the globe with regional averages in the Americas, APJC, and EMEA at 
32\-33%. No country was lower than 23% and only China was above 50% as shown in Figure 7\.

metrics, especially when they are reported to executive management and the Board of 
Directors. Among the organizations in this year’s survey, 98% are reporting one or more 
privacy\-related metrics to the Board, up from 94% in last year’s survey. See Figure 8 below.

important role in helping to ensure that governments are holding organizations accountable for 
how they manage personal data, and 157 countries (up from 145 last year) now have privacy 
laws in place3\. 

Even though complying with these laws often involves significant effort and cost (e.g., 
cataloging data, maintaining records of processing activities, implementing controls – privacy 
by design, responding to user requests), organizations recognize the positive impact on their 
organizations. Seventy\-nine percent (79%) of all corporate respondents said privacy laws 
have had a positive impact, 14% were neutral, and only 6% indicated that the laws have had a 
negative impact. The positive percentages were quite consistent across regions, with 77% in 
the Americas, 79% in EMEA, and 81% in APJC. By country, the highest average percentages 
were in India (92%), Chile (90%), France, Indonesia and Vietnam (88%). See Figure 10\.

Customers willingly share their personal data with organizations to obtain goods and services 
along with a tailored, personalized experience. Customers expect organizations to be transparent 
about their practices and treat personal data properly – a significant aspect of earning and 
building trust. As described in the Cisco 2022 Consumer Privacy Survey, 76% of consumers said 
they would not buy from an organization they did not trust with their data, and 81% agreed that 
the way an organization treats their data is indicative of how it views and respects its customers. 

Among organizations responding to this year’s Data Privacy Benchmark Survey, 96% agreed they 
have an ethical obligation to treat data properly, up from 92% in last year’s survey. However, their 
priorities are not fully consistent with those expressed by consumers. Transparency – providing 
easily accessible and clear information about how their data is being used – was the top priority 
for respondents (39%) in the consumer survey. Nearly twice as many respondents selected 
transparency as the top priority compared with not selling personal information or compliance 
with privacy laws. Yet, in this year’s survey of organizations, respondents felt compliance is the 
most important priority for building customer trust (cited by 30%), followed by transparency 
(26%). Certainly, organizations need to comply with privacy laws, but when it comes to earning 
and building trust, compliance is not enough. Consumers consider legal compliance to be a 
“given,” with transparency more of a differentiator. See Figure 11\.

While 
consumers are generally supportive of AI and many are even willing to share their anonymized 
data to help build better AI solutions, automated decision\-making remains an area of concern. It 
can be difficult for consumers to understand the algorithms and automated decisions that may 
impact them directly, such as when qualifying for a loan or getting a job interview. Ninety\-six 
percent (96%) of organizations in our survey believe they have processes already in place to 
meet the responsible and ethical standards that customers expect, which is up from 87% last 
year. Yet, the majority of consumers don’t see it that way. 

As reported in the Cisco 2022 Consumer Privacy Survey, 60% of consumers are concerned 
about how organizations apply and use AI today, and 65% already have lost trust in 
organizations over their AI practices. Fortunately, organizations may be starting to get the 
message that they aren’t doing enough. Ninety\-two percent (92%) of respondents said that 
when it comes to the application and use of AI in their solutions, their organization needs to be 
doing more to reassure customers that their data is only being used for intended and legitimate 
purposes. See Figure 12\.

would be to provide opportunities for them to opt out of the solution in which AI is applied or 
used, cited by 36% of respondents to the consumer survey. See Figure 13\.

reassure the customer? For both of these questions, providing opt\-out opportunities was 
selected least among the six options. Sixty\-three percent (63%) of organizations are ensuring 
that a human is involved in the decision\-making process, 60% provide greater transparency, 
and 55% have adopted AI ethics principles into their operations. Only 21% said that they give 
customers the opportunity to opt out. The responses are quite similar to what organizations 
believe is the most\-effective approach. Most options were selected by 41% to 58% of the 
respondents, and only 22% selected “giving customers the opportunity to opt out,” as shown in 
Figure 14\.

local providers

Many governments and organizations are putting in place data localization requirements, which 
force data to be kept within a country or region. To many, these requirements seem like a good 
idea at first, but our research indicates this view does not hold up once costs, security, privacy, 
and other tradeoffs are considered. In the Cisco 2022 Consumer Privacy Survey, for example, 
78% of consumers initially said that they thought data localization was a good idea, but support 
dropped to 41% when including the added cost for goods and services. According to 89% 
of the organizations in this year’s survey, data localization does add significant cost to their 
operations.

Results from this current study show that the vast majority (88%) of respondents believe that 
their data would be inherently safer if it is only stored within their country or region. Remarkably, 
an even larger number (90%) also said that a global provider, operating at scale, can better 
protect the data compared to local providers. When viewing these two statements together, it 
seems that while organizations would ideally like to keep their data local, they still prefer and 
trust a global provider over a local provider. Of course, their ideal solution would be to get both 
– a local instance that retains the data locally set up by a global provider. See Figure 15 below.

This research highlights the importance of privacy to organizations and the growing economic 
value of privacy investments. Even as privacy is further integrated into organizational priorities 
and processes, it will be important for organizations to meet more of consumer’s expectations 
regarding transparency and the use of personal information in AI\-driven decision making. 
Doing so will help improve an organization’s privacy posture, demonstrate trustworthiness, 
and maximize the benefits of privacy investments. The findings in this research point to these 
specific recommendations:

1\. Continue to invest in privacy and build privacy capabilities throughout your organization, 
especially among security and IT professionals and those who are involved directly with 
personal data processing and protection.

2\. Be more transparent with your customers about how their personal data is being used by the 
solutions and services your organization delivers. While organizations need to comply with the 
law, compliance alone is not enough; transparency is key to trust.

3\. When using AI in your solutions, design with AI ethics principles in mind, provide preferred 

management options to reassure customers, deliver greater transparency to the automated 
decision, and ensure that a human is involved in the process when the decision is 
consequential to a person.

4\. Consider the costs and consequences of data localization and recognize that local providers 
may be more expensive and degrade the functionality, privacy, and security of your data than 
global providers operating at scale.

Meeting our customers’ standard of trust

While organizations have always needed security and privacy to earn and build customer trust, 
today’s business environment have made them mission\-critical. As customers set their standard 
of trust, Cisco continues to listen, learn, and evolve to meet their needs. Our holistic approach 
to security and privacy – prioritizing trustworthiness, transparency, and accountability – sets us 
apart.

Over the past decade, Cisco has published a wealth of security and threat intelligence 
information for security professionals interested in the state of global cybersecurity. These 
comprehensive reports have provided detailed accounts of threat landscapes and their effects 
on organizations, as well as best practices to defend against the adverse impacts of data 
breaches.

In our new approach to thought leadership, Cisco Security is publishing a series of research\-
based, data\-driven studies. We’ve expanded the number of titles to include different reports 
for security professionals with different interests. Calling on the depth and breadth of expertise 
from threat researchers and innovators in the security industry, the reports in each year’s series 
include the Security Outcomes Report, Threat Report and Blogs, and Data Privacy Benchmark 
Study, and Consumer Privacy Survey, with others published throughout each year.
