# Methodology
Data collected for this report was obtained from publicly available resources, including 
information disclosed by threat groups themselves, and has not been validated by all 
alleged victims. As such, the number of publicly observed attacks and the actual number of 
attacks conducted may not be equal. Some groups do not publicize all of their victims, and 
almost all groups offer an option to withhold announcement if the victim pays a ransom 
within a specified timeframe or will remove posted details of the victims once a ransom has 
been paid. Additionally, some groups include incomplete information about their victim or 
claim an attack despite having successfully attacked only a small subset of their target. For 
these reasons, the data in this report is useful in aggregate, but should be evaluated as a 
report consisting of data sources that have variability. Despite this variability, we still 
consider this report as an accurate representation of the ransomware threat landscape.
We note that this report includes data and analysis of several groups that may be better 
described as "extortion" groups rather than "ransomware" groups. These groups may 
eschew encryption and instead focus only on data exfiltration and extortion, or may not 
perform intrusion operations of any kind, instead extorting or re-extorting organizations 
based on historically compromised data. While these groups do not deploy ransomware, 
we are including them in our reporting due to their relationships with other ransomware 
groups and their impact on the extortion-based cybercrime environment.
In keeping with best practices in analytic tradecraft, we have we have made efforts to 
clearly distinguish between our assessments and the underlying factual evidence which 
supports it. Statements beginning with or containing the words “we assess” should be 
considered analytic judgments based on the expertise and experience of GRIT’s analysts 
coupled with the strength and corroboration of underlying sources. Statements of 
probability – such as “likely,” “almost certainly,” and “probably” reflect levels of 
confidence in an analytic assessment based on the strength and corroboration of 
underlying sources. “Unlikely” and similar terms reflect low confidence, “likely” and 
“probably” reflect moderate confidence, and “almost certainly” reflect high confidence 
within the scope of this report. 

# Ransomware Summary
In last year’s Annual Ransomware Report, GRIT identified ransomware as "the most prolific and 
impactful threat to our networks, data, and operational capabilities," with more than 2,500 publicly 
posted victims observed in 2022. While we predicted a continuing steady increase in ransomware 
activity, 2023 outpaced our expectations, with year-over-year victim volume nearly doubling, 
driven in part by multiple mass exploitation campaigns impacting hundreds of organizations. 
In total, we observed 63 distinct ransomware groups leverage encryption, data exfiltration, data 
extortion, and other novel tactics to compromise and publicly post 4,519 victims across all 30 of 
GRIT's tracked industries, and in 120 countries.
Relative to the remainder of the year, Ransomware’s operational tempo in 2023 began slowly, 
with a progressive increase in victim posting building up to a record high of 1,353 victim posts in 
Q3, followed by a comparatively mild 1,170 victim posts in Q4. As Q4's drop-off does not appear
to correlate with any significant changes in the ransomware ecosystem, results from January 
2024 may yet show whether victim volume will decrease, remain constant, or return to form by 
increasing in the new year.

## Key Highlights
- The United States was by far the most impacted country in 2023. Among posted victims, 2,199
were US-based organizations, accounting for 49% of all observed ransomware attacks in 2023. 
Eight out of the ten most impacted countries were within North America and Europe, with Brazil 
and Australia as the sole outliers. The same "top ten" most impacted countries were home to 
76% of all observed victim organizations, of which 27% impacted non-US countries.
- From an industry perspective, GRIT observed most impacts affecting a limited subset of 
industries. 62% of all observed victims belong to one of the "top ten" most-impacted industries, 
with Manufacturing and Technology remaining the two most-impacted industries; Manufacturing 
and Technology represented 12.9% and 7.9% of all victims, respectively.
- In line with GRIT's taxonomy for classifying ransomware groups, long-term Established groups 
accounted for the overwhelming majority of observed victims (85%), followed by Developing 
groups (10%). Ephemeral and Emerging groups, as the newest and shortest-term entrants, lagged 
behind their maturing counterparts but still posed a significant threat to worldwide organizations, 
exacerbated by less "reliable" actors and frequently recycled malware. We note that for 2023, we 
have attributed only one Rebrand group in Black Suit, stemming from the now inactive Established 
group, Royal. Conversely, we have not definitively attributed any Splinter groups in 2023, though 
groups that we currently classify as Emerging or Ephemeral may, in time, show indications of 
having Splintered from other organizations.

# ANNUAL
# Ransomware Summary (cont’d)
Tactically, 2023 presented repeated opportunities for new entrants in the ransomware 
ecosystem. This was achieved either through reduced technical barriers such as the recycling of 
leaked ransomware builders and commodity malware, or the recycling of previously leaked data for 
re-extortion and claims of attacks that never were. For those established groups with resources 
and technical expertise, exploitation of high-severity and zero-day vulnerabilities provided a 
reliable means of exploiting victims at scale, a trend we assess as likely to continue into 2024 as a 
means of overcoming improvements in security.
Law enforcement disruptions and rumors thereof circulated the ransomware community in 
2023, culminating in a highly publicized takedown of Alphv's dark web leak site. Regrettably, 
Alphv chose not to go down without a fight, and its continued presence and operations highlight the 
resiliency of Ransomware's most entrenched groups. Targeting of victims previously considered 
"off limits”, such as schools and hospitals, is expected to continue, as are attempts to attract 
additional attention to high-impact ransomware attacks. This brinksmanship, which aligns with 
several of the novel coercive techniques we observed in 2023, will likely attract the attention of 
both law enforcement and potential affiliates over time.

Activity ramped up considerably throughout Q1 into Q2, then held steady at around 100-
140 posted victims per week for the remainder of 2023, with the exception of observable 
decreases in early August and October. An observable increase in victim volume in early 
September stems from a large "dump" of victim postings by the groups RansomedVC 
and Cactus.
Substantial increases in victim volume can be observed in March, June, and July following 
Clop's mass exploitation campaigns that impacted enterprise users of two distinct 
managed file transfer applications.

A quarterly breakdown of 2023's data shows a consistent and significant uptick in the volume 
of victims posted relative to the two preceding years. Emblematic of this increase, Q3 of 2023 
resulted in a higher volume of victim postings than the Q3 totals of 2021 and 2022 combined.
The rate of publicly posted ransomware victims from 2021 to 2022 saw a 4.2% decrease in 
activity year over year. Comparatively, from 2022 to 2023, ransomware victim posting 
increased by a staggering 80.1%. While mass exploitation campaigns contributed substantially 
to this large increase, such attacks contributed just over 5% of the total victims for 2023, 
demonstrating this year's significant increase in ransomware activity overall.

# Most Impactful Ransomware Threat Groups - 2023
![Graph showing Most Impactful Ransomware Threat Groups]
Following a slow close to 2022, LockBit’s activity surged considerably in the first quarter of 2023, and 
the group maintained a steady pace of operations throughout the year, even during periods when other 
groups were far less active. GRIT observed a slower summer from LockBit compared to their average, 
possibly indicating conflicts with affiliates, processes, or or infrastructure, consistent with problems 
described in open security reporting. This may have contributed to LockBit’s announcement in November, 
in which LockBit publicized a "policy" change that indicated the minimum acceptable ransom demand 
would be directly related to the victim organization revenue. Additionally, on November 15th, 2023, 
LockBit suffered an outage affecting all of it’s known Dark Web infrastructure. The issue was resolved 
later that day, with no indications as to what caused the outage.
Including Clop's mass exploitation campaigns and the May 2023 bulk posting of victims by 8Base, 
LockBit’s share among the “top 10” settled at 32% for the remainder of the year.
The Established group Royal began the year with a high and consistent volume of victims before a 
precipitous drop in Q3, when their leak site went dark. The group is believed to have since Rebranded 
as "Black Suit", which began continuing operations in Q4.
Play, a group responsible for only around 1% of observed victims in 2022, quietly and significantly 
increased their operations to become the fourth-most prolific group in 2023, in terms of observed victims.
GRIT observed the 6th- and 7th-most victims from Bianlian and Akira, despite the publication of 
ransomware decryptors which would degrade the effectiveness of encryption as leverage. Both groups 
appear to have quickly pivoted to extortion based solely on exfiltrated data and have maintained a 
significant operational capacity.
While retaining its place as the second-most impactful ransomware group, Alphv earned significant media 
coverage this Fall after claiming breaches against MGM Resorts and Caesars International through an 
elaborate social engineering campaign conducted by the prominent threat group, Scattered Spider.

# Cumulative Victims by Threat Group - 2023
![Graph showing Cumulative Victims by Threat Group]
Interestingly, while Rhysida (Developing) was not a leading group in terms of total posted 
victims, coming in 13th amongst competing groups, the group caused disproportionate impacts 
on traditionally sensitive industries, including Education, Healthcare, and Government sectors. 
46 of Rhysida's 74 posted victims belong to one of these three industries.
Among Manufacturing industry victims, the US was impacted five times as much as the next 
highest country, Germany. Specifically, the US saw 265 impacted Manufacturing victims, while 
Germany saw a significantly lower number of Manufacturing victims at 48. Manufacturing was 
the most impacted industry for almost every month in 2023, excluding May, when it placed 
behind Technology by a single observed victim.
The "top 10" most impacted industries accounted for 2,794 (62%) of all posted victims and 
were impacted by all but one of the groups tracked by GRIT – Free Civilian, a group with only 
two posted Ukrainian victims in late January 2023. Free Civilian, a self-proclaimed pro-Russian 
hacktivist group, has been reported as a Russian GRU persona by Microsoft and Mandiant. 
Given the typical diversity of impacted victims, limited victim diversity may serve as a future 
indicator for government-sponsored “faux-ransomware” operations.
Alphv's status as one of the leading ransomware groups impacting the Healthcare industry may 
continue after their response to law enforcement efforts to shut down their operations. After 
restoring operations, Alphv announced a change to affiliate rules, allowing the targeting of 
critical infrastructure. This may lead less scrupulous affiliates to disproportionately target 
hospitals and other healthcare providers using Alphv's ransomware.

Most Impacted:
Established ransomware groups dominated the ransomware ecosystem when compared to 
less mature groups as classified in our taxonomy. Despite representing less than a third of 
all distinct observed groups operating during 2023, Established groups generated 
a disproportionately high victim volume.
Established groups eventually ceded some of their dominant market share during Q4, with a 
greater portion of observed victims stemming from operations of Developing and Emerging 
groups. GRIT has previously observed a slight slowdown in the operations tempo of 
Established groups over the preceding two years. A portion of the decrease in activity could 
also potentially be attributed to law enforcement's temporary disruption of the Established 
group Alphv in December 2023.
Only one group, Black Suit, was classified as a Rebrand during 2023, whose victims account 
for a minute subset of the overall 2023 data. While other groups may be later determined by 
GRIT to be Rebrands or Splinter groups, only Black Suit's Rebrand was sufficiently attributable.

The number of days in which each group type was active in 2023 paints a clear picture of 
the distinction between them within GRIT's taxonomy. “Days active” was measured by the 
number of distinct dates on which each group type updated their data leak sites with 
additional victims.
Established groups, which most frequently follow the Ransomware-as-a-Service model, 
generally have multiple affiliates acquiring victims at any given time, which allows them to 
post a near-continuous flow of victims to their data leak sites. Such groups also possess 
greater resources and staffing, which could support more timely and frequent updates.
Ephemeral groups, by contrast, are short-lived, resulting in minimal victim postings over 
short periods of time, as indicated by their minimal activity on data leak sites.
Developing groups – defined by GRIT's taxonomy as nascent groups focused on evolution, 
improvement, and TTP refinement – have demonstrated continuing operations and the ability 
to generate a consistent stream of victims. While not as well-resourced or entrenched as 
Established groups, we still expect to see higher levels of activity from these groups than 
short-term Ephemeral groups or newly arrived Emerging groups. The observable days of 
activity for Developing groups support this definition, presenting a substantial level of activity 
second only to Established groups.

Emerging groups were the only group type with Government amongst their most victimized industries, 
and Government victims were, in turn, the most impacted by Emerging groups. Emerging groups may 
be entirely new to the ransomware ecosystem and select targets differently than more mature groups, 
who may avoid government targets to avoid undesired attention from law enforcement.
Healthcare targets rose in popularity among both Established and Developing groups in 2023. 
Healthcare victims often hold a large amount of PII data, rendering them a high-value target for more 
mature ransomware groups capable of exploiting or extorting based on large volumes of data. While 
the Healthcare industry was once considered off-limits and less frequent as targets by Established 
groups, we have witnessed this norm eroding in 2023.
Manufacturing remains one of the most highly victimized industries across most group categories. This 
is likely driven in part by cybersecurity challenges within manufacturing organizations, as well as the 
fact that these organizations often suffer significant costs from operational disruption of manufacturing 
processes, potentially rendering them more likely to pay ransoms in support of a fast recovery.

Relative to their share of the ransomware ecosystem, Developing and Emerging groups 
disproportionately impacted Healthcare organizations more often than Established groups. 
Healthcare has historically been considered “off limits” for some ransomware programs as this 
brings negative press coverage and extra attention from law enforcement agencies. Despite 
this, Established groups saw a relative increase in Healthcare victims from the previous year.
Emerging groups disproportionately victimized organizations within the Retail and Wholesale 
industry – an industry whose market value increased from $71.8 Billion to $77.2 Billion, 
according to the Business Research Company. This 7% increase in market value, coupled 
with a propensity for weaker cybersecurity postures among mid-size organizations, could 
make this industry a more appealing target for ransomware groups.
Manufacturing consistently remains the most affected industry across all group classifications. 
Over 20% of victims belong to the manufacturing industry across all group classifications 
except Emerging groups.

The United States was the most impacted country across all group classifications, 
reflecting its status as an attractive target for ransomware groups from inception 
through maturity. This is likely due to the perception of victim organizations in 
the US as more likely to pay ransoms and the profit-maximizing nature of 
ransomware operations.
Emerging and Ephemeral groups appear to target more victims outside of the 
Global North, potentially limited by language barriers or technical proficiency, or 
to maintain a lower profile while beginning operations. As groups progress across 
the maturity spectrum, victim concentration appears to shift towards North 
American and Western European targets.
Throughout 2023, GRIT hypothesized that the price of Bitcoin may correlate with ransomware 
victim posting rates. As we closed out the year, we examined the year's complete data to 
validate or refute this hypothesis.
A cursory review of victim posts and Bitcoin prices across weekly intervals in 2023 reveals two 
possible focal points. The first is the general trend of an overall rise of Bitcoin value appearing to 
correlate with an increase in ransom victim posts during the first three months of the year, along 
with a steady increase in ransomware reports.
The second is an observable and dramatic shift between the rise of Bitcoin value in contrast with 
a decline in victim reports from October until the end of the year.

![Graph showing Rate of Posted Ransomware Victims vs Price of Bitcoin in USD (2023)]
Methodically structuring our data painted a clearer picture and allowed us to better view 
trends with less noise. Firstly, Clop’s mass exploitation campaigns resulted in the posting of 
54 different victims at one time on March 18. This mass exploitation campaign is abnormal 
and skews the data that would otherwise be indicative of overall operational tempo. Similarly, 
the Developing group 8Base debuted their data leak site on May 23rd, with 66 victims posted 
simultaneously. Those victims were almost certainly acquired throughout the preceding 
months, likewise, skewing our data. These victims were removed from the associated graph
to better demonstrate the overall trend in ransomware operational tempo during 2023.
We calculated a 4-day period simple moving average to better normalize victim post data and 
account for variances between dates of initial compromise and the date of a victim's post to a 
group's site.
Comparing this moving average with the price of Bitcoin, a much stronger correlation can be 
observed between posting rates and Bitcoin value. Supporting this observable correlation 
through data, we see a correlation coefficient of .565, demonstrating a moderate correlation. 
Limiting our focus to just the data from January through September before October's drop 
further yields a 0.747 correlation coefficient, reflecting a strong correlative relationship 
between victim post rates and Bitcoin value over time.

![Graph showing Rate of Posted Ransomware Victims vs Price of Bitcoin in USD, Outliers Removed (2023)]
In reviewing the decreased correlation from October through the end of the year, we 
considered the root cause and the drivers of our hypothesis, searching for potential 
explanations. While we cannot conclusively rule out other drivers, we note that Bitcoin value 
surged during this time period, driven by announcements that the US Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) may approve Bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds (ETF), which would 
provide a path for investors to purchase Bitcoin and Bitcoin derivatives through stock market 
exchange services.
Although we cannot affirm the motivations and drivers of individual ransomware actors, we 
note our findings as potentially suggestive of ransomware group activity increasing with 
interest in Bitcoin procurement over time, with increased activity correlating a moderate to 
high amount during periods of value growth in the cryptocurrency. We observed a similar 
correlation between the price of Bitcoin and the posting rates of ransomware groups during 
our 2022 ransomware report, which strengthens our assessment of a relationship between 
the two data sets, as this now appears to be a year-over-year trend. The dataset in 2022 did 
not experience the end-of-the-year separation between the trendlines as did 2023’s data.
We note and acknowledge that we lack insight into the number of ransomware victims that 
pay ransoms across the year and that the addition of such data may substantially impact or 
change our findings.

# Major Events in Ransomware:
# 2023 at a Glance
Clop's mass exploitation of Progress Software's MOVEit managed file transfer software impacted 
hundreds of victims across multiple industries in a lightning campaign, with impacts continuing 
throughout the Summer. The incident would go on to become one of the most reported 
cybersecurity stories of the year, with reporting providing information ranging from technical details 
of the exploit through to the ensuing fallout and data publication. Notably, the campaign mirrors 
earlier Clop mass exploitation campaigns, with the group executing an elaborate, coordinated plan 
to exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities, resulting in data theft and extortion for profit.
The patience and planning demonstrated by the group in this case and other mass exploitation 
campaigns that rely on "zero-day" vulnerabilities are crucial to maximizing impact and revenue 
extraction before an associated vulnerability can be discovered and patched. To support Clop's "all 
at once" approach to exploitation, the group automated and tested a process that would extract all 
available data held by victim companies that ran the impacted application exposed to the internet. 
As the operation came to light in early June, Clop updated their data leak site with a generic 
message inviting anyone who believed that they might have been affected to reach out to them to 
prevent the publication of sensitive data collected in the campaign. This approach likely reduced 
the time burden of contacting individually impacted victims and initial communications unlikely to 
lead to settlement.
While the group worked through any ensuing negotiations with victims and began posting the data 
of non-compliant organizations to their data leak site, they very likely encountered issues with 
hosting the substantial amount of exfiltrated data on their existing infrastructure, facing limitations 
of the onion protocol, which hosted their site and the illegal nature of the data's possession. With 
necessity as the mother of invention, Clop would go on to experiment with alternative hosting 
strategies with varying levels of success. The group tried uploading data on a per-victim basis to 
clearnet sites hosted on domains directly naming the victim. This approach gained headlines, but 
the process was likely deemed too resource-intensive for Clop, who ultimately only used this 
approach on a handful of victims.
As an alternative strategy, the group also hosted victim data in a series of Torrent files. This 
strategy leveraged the inherently distributed nature of the Torrent protocol to make a more 
reliable, albeit significantly slower, solution to sharing stolen data. These actions by Clop 
demonstrate the difficulty of pulling off a true successful mass exploitation campaign, including 
managing "long tail" logistical considerations such as data storage. In spite of early issues, the 
incident would go on to be considered one of if not the largest single incident of data theft in 
history. Should mass exploitation campaigns spread as a tactic to other threat groups, Clop may 
prove to be a model for this style of attack and associated scale.

# Major Events in Ransomware:
# Clop’s MOVEit Campaign
In September 2023, two of the largest entertainment companies in the country, MGM Resorts 
International and Caesars Entertainment, confirmed downtime caused by ransomware 
attacks. As details emerged, the two attacks seemed to share a common thread, a connection 
with a threat group and new affiliate of Alphv, referred to as Scattered Spider by security 
researchers. Alphv called public attention to the attack by posting a diatribe to their data leak 
site in an attempt to place pressure on MGM after they refused payment. After weeks of 
downtime, MGM reported that their losses in this single attack would exceed $100 million 
USD. Unconfirmed details also emerged about the method of ingress for both the MGM and 
Caesars attacks; both were said to be a result of social engineering by Scattered Spider, 
which is known for its skill in English-language social engineering to circumvent Identity 
and Access Management.
A frequent tactic in this space, and one employed by Scattered Spider in the past, is 
breaching network accounts via calls to an organization’s help desk. Threat actors, armed
