The state of healthcare 
cybersecurity
Globally, cyberattacks continue to increase 
in sophistication, frequency and intensity. 
Organizations across all industries must be 
vigilant and proactive to protect against and 
respond to cybersecurity risks. For healthcare, 
the potential impact of cyberattacks 
goes beyond disruption to the availability, 
confidentiality and integrity of systems 
and data. Patient care can be impacted 
when medical devices or systems become 
unavailable or cannot be trusted due to 
cyberattacks, or when such attacks cause 
interruptions or delays. To protect patient 
safety and privacy, healthcare delivery 
organizations, medical device manufacturers 
and third-party suppliers must work together 
to guard against cybersecurity risks. By 
working to secure BD products, we are 
helping to protect the healthcare ecosystem.

2023 Product Security Annual Report
Current state
There is a collective emphasis on improving 
cybersecurity practices.
The entire healthcare industry is on a journey to continuously improve cybersecurity. Regulatory 
authorities are defining more specific cybersecurity requirements for medical devices, aimed at 
protecting patient safety. At the same time, cybersecurity expectations of manufacturers have 
increased across critical infrastructure. These changes are evident in new cybersecurity requirements 
for manufacturers in Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Practices such as managing 
cybersecurity over the full product life cycle, providing a software-bill-of-materials (SBOM), and 
communicating potential risks and vulnerabilities feature prominently in the new requirements.* 
Healthcare cybersecurity trends
Three cybersecurity trends have impacted the healthcare industry over the last year:
These trends reinforce the need for ongoing vigilance and continuous improvement. 
At BD, our product security strategy includes a total life cycle  
approach to working to protect BD products and communicating 
with our customers and patients about potential cybersecurity 
risks and emerging threats. This report summarizes our approach 
to product security, our culture of transparency in alignment with 
regulatory and industry best practices, and our ongoing efforts 
to collaborate across the industry to advance cybersecurity 
in healthcare.
*For insight regarding how BD assesses emerging regulations, see page 5.

Cyberattacks are becoming more 
frequent, advanced and adaptive.
Increased reliance on digital infrastructure and systems, 
coupled with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence 
and robotic process automation, are providing new avenues 
for threat actors to launch cyberattacks. In healthcare, the 
top motivation behind cyberattacks is financial gain[^1]. The U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) tracks large 
data breaches through its Office for Civil Rights. Between 2018 
and 2022, large breaches in the U.S. increased 93% and large 
breaches involving ransomware increased 278%[^2]. Geopolitical 
events have also increased cybersecurity risks on a global basis.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled cyberattacks  
are changing the threat landscape.
In August 2023, HHS issued a warning about ransomware attacks being launched via 
phishing emails[^3]. Around the same time, malicious generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) 
tools like WormGPT and FraudGPT began to emerge on the dark web, making it even 
easier for threat actors to plan and launch these types of attacks[^4]. In addition, Gartner
® 
predicts that “By 2025, the consumerization of AI-enabled fraud will fundamentally 
change the enterprise attack surface, driving more outsourcing of enterprise trust and 
focus on security education and awareness[^5].”

## Securing BD products

### Methodology
Cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated, frequent 
and adaptive. No company is immune; cyberattacks can 
impact even the most mature technology companies. 
BD strives to meet high security standards. We also 
recognize that new cybersecurity threats emerge daily 
across the healthcare industry—which is why we believe 
transparency and collaboration are essential. We 
base our strategic approach to cybersecurity on three 
guiding principles:

**Security by design**
BD products are designed with security in mind and 
to align with industry-leading cybersecurity standards, 
including those from the International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO) and the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST).

**Security in use**
Through collaboration,  
BD enables customers to 
secure and maintain 
BD products throughout 
their intended useful life. 

**Security through partnership**
BD seeks to be a trusted partner helping to 
advance cybersecurity across the industry by 
participating in cybersecurity working groups 
and public-private partnerships.

**Our services**
BD provides flexible servicing options for select software-enabled products.

2023 Product Security Annual Report
Securing BD products 
BD Cybersecurity, Product Security and 
Regulatory teams routinely assess emerging 
cybersecurity regulations, rules and guidance. 
These teams work cross-functionally to perform  
product-level gap assessments against our cybersecurity 
processes, and we update the BD Cybersecurity 
Framework accordingly as needed. For example, the 
BD Cybersecurity Framework was updated in 2023 to:
- Place a stronger emphasis on activities that take 
place during the project ideation and planning phase, 
including design requirements, architecture design and 
threat modeling. 
- Clarify activities that may be carried out during 
the qualification phase, including verification 
and validation, compliance against cybersecurity 
requirements, and expanded activities as part of 
cybersecurity testing.
- Provide a more comprehensive and complete view of 
cybersecurity risk management, including supplier risk 
management and supply chain risk management.

BD anticipates updating the framework to incorporate 
elements of the Medical Device and Health IT Joint 
Security Plan Version 2.0, which was published in 
March, 2024.

![Diagram of the BD Cybersecurity Framework]

Our Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) follows the BD Cybersecurity 
Framework which incorporates design requirements, including cybersecurity risk 
assessment, threat modeling, penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, software 
composition analysis, code analysis, system hardening and continuous vulnerability 
management. The framework serves as a blueprint for managing cybersecurity risk  
across BD products. It is aligned to multiple industry standards and work products, 
including the Healthcare and Public Health Sector Coordinating Council (HSCC) Medical 
Device and Health IT Joint Security Plan, the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 2900 
Standard for Software Cybersecurity for Network-Connectable Products.

### Cybersecurity risk assessments
BD regularly works with customers to respond to product-specific cybersecurity 
risk assessment questionnaires. We also participate in multiple commercially 
available third-party risk assessment programs to support our customers’ vendor risk 
management processes.

Cybersecurity certifications and third-
party attestations provide objective 
assurance regarding a company’s 
cybersecurity processes and controls.  
In a world where cybersecurity 
risks and threats are increasing, the 
perspective of an external, objective 
cybersecurity expert is highly valued. 

**Cybersecurity certifications 
and attestations**
Our certification and attestation programs include System and Organization Controls (SOC2+) and UL 
Cybersecurity Assurance Program (UL CAP). SOC2+ annual reports are available for multiple BD products 
that collect and process patient health information in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other applicable laws and regulations governing the use and 
processing of such information. These reports are prepared by an independent third party and provide 
assurance regarding the operational effectiveness of BD internal controls and the security of BD products. 
UL CAP is another independently audited certification that demonstrates the cybersecurity of 
participating BD medical devices through a rigorous program of analysis. 
For information about all of our cybersecurity certifications and attestations,  
visit the BD Cybersecurity Trust Center.

2023 Product Security Annual Report
Securing BD products 
Our technology landscape continues to rapidly evolve 
as BD delivers significant innovations to patients and 
customers as we pursue our Purpose of advancing the 
world of health
™. At the same time, cybersecurity risks 
for software and connected devices continue to grow. 
That is why we believe managing cybersecurity over 
the full product life cycle is a mission-critical initiative. 
This includes securing software as a medical device 
(SaMD), software used in medical devices and software 
used to make medical devices. It is not enough to 
release a medical device that is secure; responsible 
medical device manufacturers must work closely with 
their customers and suppliers to maintain cybersecurity 
over each product’s intended useful life. Here is what 
that looks like at BD.

### Securing the medical device ecosystem
**Legacy products**
The usability of a medical device often 
extends beyond its intended useful life. 
This is why communicating a clear End of 
Support (EOS) strategy for legacy devices 
is critical. At BD, we monitor end-of-life 
(EOL) components and tools, strategize 
proactive risk transfer, and provide targeted 
communications to keep customers 
informed before a product or its operating 
system reaches EOS. 

**In-market products**
Securing the medical device ecosystem requires transparency and collaboration. For products in the market and in use, we prioritize 
ongoing vulnerability management. We do this by leveraging SBOMs for thorough, robust vulnerability monitoring and response, 
accelerating patch deployment, periodic penetration testing and increasing observability. When BD discovers a vulnerability in one 
of our products, or a potential vulnerability is reported to us and confirmed by BD, we share that information with our customers 
to make them aware of potential risks, mitigations and compensating controls. We do this in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) guidance and in furtherance of our culture of transparency. To learn more about our responsible disclosure 
processes, see Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Process on page 10.

**Products in development**
BD is committed to security by design.  
We strive to build the latest cybersecurity 
best practices and advances into our 
products and processes from the start 
whenever possible. For example, our newest 
software-enabled products incorporate 
system-level threat modeling, rigorous 
penetration testing and code signing for 
authentication and code integrity. They are 
also designed for updateability, and their 
cybersecurity documentation includes a 
software-bill-of-materials (SBOMs).

### Coordinated vulnerability disclosure process
Report
BD welcomes vulnerability reports 
from security researchers, customers, 
third-party component vendors 
and other external groups that 
wish to report a vulnerability in a 
BD software-enabled device. Visit 
the BD Cybersecurity Trust Center 
to report a potential vulnerability or 
security concern.

Analyze
BD partners with the issue reporter 
to investigate the vulnerability. If 
confirmed, our incident response team 
collaborates with various functional 
teams including Research and 
Development (which includes Product 
Security), as well as Quality and Privacy 
to respond to the issue.

Coordinate
BD follows FDA guidance to properly 
communicate confirmed BD product 
vulnerabilities in coordination with a 
Computer Emergency Readiness Team 
(CERT). We work with the Cybersecurity & 
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to 
prepare coordinated vulnerability disclosures 
for our respective websites, and we also 
voluntarily report vulnerabilities unique to 
BD products to the FDA.

Disclose
Bulletins are published on the BD Cybersecurity Trust Center 
and the CISA website in a coordinated fashion. For maximum 
awareness, we also share BD vulnerability disclosures with 
Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) where 
BD participates, including the Health Information Sharing and 
Analysis Center (H-ISAC). H-ISAC sends hundreds of targeted 
alerts to its members each year from their Threat Operations 
Center[^6]. This practice helps healthcare delivery organizations 
of all sizes stay current with vulnerability disclosures across 
the industry.

BD has a mature coordinated vulnerability disclosure program to help customers manage 
cybersecurity risks over each product’s intended useful life to support our culture of transparency. 

Current state
Collaboration

11
2023 Product Security Annual Report
Securing BD products 
BD welcomes vulnerability reports from customers, security researchers and third-party component vendors. We also use 
multiple methods, including vulnerability scanning, threat modeling and penetration testing, to uncover potential risks 
and vulnerabilities during the design process and throughout the software development life cycle. 
When a vulnerability is discovered and confirmed in a BD product, we follow 
FDA guidance to disclose the vulnerability so customers and/or patients can 
apply mitigations and compensating controls and, if a patch is available, 
prioritize patch management in accordance with the vulnerability severity 
and potential impact to patient safety and/or privacy.
When a vulnerability exists in a third-party component used in association 
with a BD product, BD collaborates with our third-party partners to better 
understand the potential impact to BD products. If BD determines that 
BD offerings are in scope, we issue a product security bulletin on the 
BD Cybersecurity Trust Center. Additionally, when patches are made 
available by third-party component vendors, we test and validate those 
patches before making them available to BD customers. 
BD is also authorized as a Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE
®) 
Numbering Authority by the CVE Program. When a vulnerability is unique 
to a BD device, we assign a CVE number which helps customers manage 
their internal vulnerability and patch management processes efficiently. 
We also report the vulnerability to the FDA and work closely with CISA to 
prepare public disclosures that are published on the CISA website and the 
BD Cybersecurity Trust Center in coordinated fashion.
Sharing vulnerabilities in this way is an essential component to enabling 
healthcare providers to mitigate risks. However, we also recognize that 
our customers work with hundreds of medical device manufacturers, and 
they use Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations to stay up to 
date on medical device vulnerability disclosures. That is why we also share 
our vulnerability disclosures with the Health Information Sharing and 
Analysis Center (H-ISAC) to maximize awareness.
Vulnerability disclosure indicates maturity in an organization’s cybersecurity 
practices. BD has led the way in this open, transparent approach and strives 
to help customers manage cybersecurity risks properly through awareness 
and guidance.

### More about coordinated vulnerability disclosure
**Cybersecurity resources  
for BD customers**
