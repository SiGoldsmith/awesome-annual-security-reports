Introduction
CyberEdge’s annual Cyberthreat Defense Report (CDR) plays a 
unique role in the IT security industry. Other surveys do a great 
job of collecting statistics on cyberattacks and data breaches 
and exploring the techniques of cybercriminals and other bad 
actors. Our mission is to provide deep insight into the minds of IT 
security professionals. 
Now in its eighth year, the CDR has become a staple among IT 
security leaders and practitioners by helping them gauge their 
internal practices and security investments against those of their 
counterparts across multiple countries and industries. If you want 
to know what your peers in IT security are thinking and doing, 
this is the place to look. 
CyberEdge would like to thank our Silver, Gold, and Platinum 
research sponsors, whose continued support is essential to the 
success of this report.
Top Five Insights for 2021
As always, our latest CDR installment yields dozens of actionable 
insights. But the following are the top five takeaways from this 
year’s report:
1\. Successful cyberattacks make the biggest jump in six 
years. When CyberEdge launched the first CDR in 2014, 62% of 
organizations were compromised by successful cyberattacks. 
That number has risen to 86%. The percentage of organizations 
experiencing a successful attack rose 5\.5% this year, the largest 
increase in six years. We believe this surge is due in large part 
to the dramatic rise in BYOD policy adoptions and a massive 
increase in third\-party risks.
2\. Rewarding ransom payers is good for business (if you 
are a cybercriminal). For the first time, more than two\-thirds 
of organizations (69%) were victimized by ransomware. The 
percentage of ransom\-paying organizations that recover their 
compromised data has increased steadily in recent years, from 
49% in 2018 to 72% in 2021\. Cybercriminals have learned 
that withholding data following payment receipt is bad for 
business. Unfortunately, this trend has enticed most victims 
to pay ransoms (57% in 2021\), which in turn has funded more 
ransomware attacks, resulting in more organizations being 
compromised by ransomware than ever before.
3\. Adoption of cloud security solutions is rising. The 
COVID\-19 pandemic has sparked more interest in cloud\-based IT 
security solutions than ever before. A year ago, 36% of security 
applications and services were delivered via the cloud. This year, 
that number has risen to 41%. 
4\. IT security spending increases are slowing. For the first 
time since we began tracking this statistic four years ago, the 
percentage of a typical IT budget spent on security has remained 
flat (at 13%) rather than rising. And for the first time in our 
eight\-year CDR history, the percentage of organizations with 
rising security budgets has fallen (from 85% to 78%) and the 
average security budget increase has also declined (from \+5% to 
\+4%). So, overall IT security spending is still rising, but at a slower 
pace than usual.
5\. Pessimism is the new normal. Eight years ago, 38% of 
CDR respondents felt that it was more likely than not that their 
company would be compromised by a successful cyberattack 
in the coming year. Sadly, eight years later, that number has 
doubled to 76%. IT security professionals are no longer just 
measured on their abilities to prevent cyberattacks from 
happening, but also their abilities to detect, terminate, and 
remediate from in\-progress attacks.

Introduction
About This Report
The CDR is the most geographically comprehensive, vendor\-
agnostic study of IT security decision makers and practitioners. 
Rather than compiling cyberthreat statistics and assessing 
the damage caused by data breaches, the CDR surveys the 
perceptions of IT security professionals, gaining insights into how 
they see the world.
Specifically, the CDR examines:
v The frequency of successful cyberattacks in the prior year and 
optimism (or pessimism) about preventing further attacks in 
the coming year
v The perceived impact of cyberthreats and the challenges 
faced in mitigating their risks
v The adequacy of organizations’ security postures and their 
internal security practices
v The organizational factors that present the most significant 
barriers to establishing effective cyberthreat defenses
v The investments in security technologies already made and 
those planned for the coming year
v The health of IT security budgets and the portion of the 
overall IT budget they consume
By revealing these details, we help IT security decision makers 
and practitioners gain a better understanding of how their 
perceptions, concerns, priorities, and defenses stack up against 
those of their peers around the world. IT security teams can 
use the data, analyses, and findings to shape answers to many 
important questions, such as: 
v Where do we have gaps in our cyberthreat defenses relative 
to other organizations?
v Have we fallen behind in our defensive strategy to the point 
that our organization is now the “low\-hanging fruit” (i.e., likely 
to be targeted more often due to its relative weaknesses)?
v Are we on track with our approach and progress in 
addressing traditional areas of concern, while also tackling 
the challenges of emerging threats?
v How does our level of spending on IT security compare to 
that of other organizations?
v Do other IT security practitioners think differently about 
cyberthreats and their defenses, and should we adjust our 
perspective and plans to account for these differences?
Another important objective of the CDR is to provide developers 
of IT security technologies and services with information they 
can use to better align their solutions with the concerns and 
requirements of potential customers. Our data can lead to better 
market traction and success for solution providers, along with 
better cyberthreat protection technologies for all the intrepid 
defenders out there.
The findings of the CDR are divided into four sections:
Section 1: Current Security Posture
Our journey into the world of cyberthreat defenses begins 
with respondents’ assessments of the effectiveness of their 
organization’s investments and strategies relative to the 
prevailing threat landscape. They report on the frequency of 
successful cyberattacks, judge their organization’s security 
posture in specific IT domains and security functions, and provide 
details on the IT security skills shortage. The data will help readers 
begin to assess:
v Whether, to what extent, and how urgently changes are 
needed in their own organization
v Specific countermeasures they should add to supplement 
existing defenses

Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns
In this section, our exploration of cyberthreat defenses shifts 
from establishing baseline security postures to determining the 
types of cyberthreats and obstacles to security that most concern 
today’s organizations. The survey respondents weigh in on the 
most alarming cyberthreats, barriers to establishing effective 
defenses, and high\-profile issues such as ransomware and cloud 
security. These appraisals will help readers think about how their 
own organizations can best improve cyberthreat defenses going 
forward.
Section 3: Current and Future Investments
Organizations can ill afford to stand still when it comes to 
maintaining effective cyberthreat defenses. IT security teams 
must keep pace with changes occurring in business, technology, 
and threat landscapes. This section of the survey provides data 
on the direction of IT security budgets, and on current and 
planned investments in network security, endpoint security, 
application and data security, security management and 
operations, and identity and access management. Readers will be 
able to compare their organization’s investment decisions against 
the broad sample and get a sense of what “hot” technologies 
their peers are deploying.
Section 4: Practices and Strategies
Mitigating today’s cyberthreat risks takes more than investing 
in the right technologies. You must ensure those technologies 
are deployed optimally, configured correctly, and monitored 
adequately to give your organization a fighting chance to avoid 
being a front\-page news story. In the final section of the survey 
our respondents provide information on how they are deploying 
and using leading\-edge technologies and services such as 
security analytics and IT security delivered from the cloud. We 
also look at how IT security training and professional certification 
can help enterprises address the serious shortfall in skilled IT 
security staff.

Current Security Posture
v Most successful attacks in six years. The percentage of 
organizations compromised by successful attacks rose by 
5\.5% – the largest annual increase in six years (page 7\)!
v Deepening pessimism. For the first time, three\-quarters 
(76%) of security professionals believe a successful attack is 
imminent – up from 38% seven years ago (page 9\).
v The weakest link: mobile devices. Following a rise in WFH 
and BYOD policy adoptions, mobile devices are rated as most 
challenging to secure (page 11\).
v Shedding light on third\-party risks. A new entrant in this 
year’s CDR, third\-party risk management (TPRM), is deemed 
the most challenging IT security function (page 13\).
v Feeling overwhelmed. The vast majority (87%) of organi­
zations are experiencing an IT security skills shortfall, and it 
has worsened during the pandemic (page 15\).
Perceptions and Concerns
v Cyberthreat migraines. Malware, ransomware, and spear 
phishing continue to cause the most headaches; zero\-day 
attacks not as much (page 17\).
v Web and mobile attacks. Nine out of 10 organizations 
(91%) have been affected by cyberattacks targeting web and 
mobile applications (page 19\).
v Fueling ransomware. More than two\-thirds of organizations 
(69%) were victimized by ransomware and most (57%) paid 
the ransom (page 21\).
v Security awareness gap. For the second consecutive year, 
the number one barrier to IT security’s success is “low security 
awareness among employees” (page 24\).
v Unified app and data security. “Simplified security 
monitoring” is the top benefit achieved by integrating applica\-
tion and data security to the same platform (page 26\).
v Cybersecurity career boosts. Nearly all (99%) respondents 
agree that achieving a specialized cybersecurity certification 
would benefit their career (page 27\).
Current and Future Investments
v Security spending plateau? The percentage of a typical IT 
budget spent on security remained flat (12\.7%) for the first 
time in three years (page 29\).
v Slowing security spending. For the first time in CDR history, 
the percentage of organizations with rising security budgets 
has declined (from 85% to 78%) and the average security 
budget increase has declined (from \+5% to \+4%) (page 31\).
v Pandemic\-fueled spending reprioritization. The COVID\-19 
pandemic forced around seven out of eight (86%) organizations
to reprioritize IT security spending (page 33\).
v Network security’s top picks. NGFWs, DoS/DDoS 
prevention, and deception are the top network security 
technologies planned for acquisition in 2021 (page 35\).
v Endpoint security shopping list. Deception and browser 
isolation are the endpoint security technologies most sought 
after this year (page 37\).
v The stars of app/data security. API gateways and WAFs 
remain supreme, while bot management and FIM/FAM are 
on many shopping lists for 2021 (page 39\).
v TIPs tipping the scale again. Threat intelligence platforms 
(TIPs) are atop the list of security management and 
operations technologies planned for acquisition (page 41\).
v Biometrics still red hot. Biometrics tops the list of identity 
and access management (IAM) technologies planned for 
acquisition this year (page 43\).
v Demand for ML/AI holds strong. Once again, 85% of 
respondents prefer security products that feature machine 
learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) (page 45\).
Practices and Strategies
v Security is going cloud. 41% of security applications are 
delivered via the cloud, up from 36% last year (page 47\).
v Reaping the benefits of DevSecOps. More than nine 
out of 10 organizations (93%) are realizing the benefits of 
DevSecOps (page 49\).
v Decryption challenges. Nearly nine in 10 organizations 
(88%) are facing challenges with decrypting SSL/TLS traffic 
for cyberthreat inspection (page 51\).
v Embracing emerging technologies. Most organizations 
have embraced emerging security technologies: SD\-WAN 
(82%), zero trust (75%), and SASE (74%) (page 53\).

Section 1: Current Security Posture
How many times do you estimate that your organization’s global network has been compromised by a 
successful cyberattack within the past 12 months? 
Past Frequency of Successful Cyberattacks
The last year has been enormously challenging, both personally 
and professionally, on so many levels. When the world was 
turned upside down by the COVID\-19 pandemic, cybercriminals 
exploited the situation in many ways. Phishing campaigns, 
deceptive domains, and malicious apps are just a few of the 
tactics these crooks employed to convert pain into profit.
In last year’s CDR, we saw a small uptick in successful cyber­
attacks as we crossed the 80% threshold for the first time in our 
report’s history. This year, we saw the largest annual increase in 
successful attacks within the last six years. Just over 86% of our 
responding organizations experienced at least one successful 
cyberattack within the preceding 12 months, with about four in 
10 organizations experiencing six incidents or more (see Figures 
1 and 2\).
Of the seven major industries surveyed for this report, education 
was the hardest hit with 92\.3% of organizations reporting a 
successful attack, followed by manufacturing (90\.3%), telecom 
and technology (87\.4%), and finance (85\.5%). Next came 
healthcare (84\.6%) and retail (81\.7%). The bright spot this year 
Figure 1: Frequency of successful cyberattacks in the last 12 months.
was government, with only 72\.5% of respondents experiencing a 
successful attack (see Figure 3\). 
Geographically, Colombia claimed the top spot this year for the 
most organizations experiencing a successful attack (93\.9%). 
Down the list, China (91\.5%), Germany (91\.5%), Mexico (90\.6%), 
Spain (89\.8%), and the United States (89\.7%) were a bit above 
average. Countries that fared the best included the United 
Kingdom (71\.1%), Japan (80\.9%), Australia (81\.6%), and Turkey 
(82\.0%) (see Figure 4\).

Aside from COVID\-19\-specific threats, what other trends caused 
such a big jump in successful cyberattacks? We’re glad you asked. 
Last year, CyberEdge conducted a multi\-sponsor research study 
titled, “The Impact of COVID\-19 on Enterprise IT Security Teams” 
(see page 55 for more information). 
We surveyed 600 enterprise IT security professionals from seven 
major countries. Key revelations included:
v 114% increase in remote workers
v 59% increase in BYOD adoptions
v 73% observed increased third\-party risks
With the majority of IT security organizations already under­
staffed before any of us knew what a coronavirus was, having 
to support so many additional remote workers, many of whom 
were (and perhaps still are) using unmanaged devices, caused 
organizations’ collective attack surfaces to increase exponentially 
almost overnight. Frankly, we’re fortunate that we didn’t see 
more than a 5\.5% increase in victimized organizations. 
Our hats are off to all of you who worked so tirelessly to defend 
your company’s digital assets during such trying times! We 
dedicate this year’s CDR to you.

Section 1: Current Security Posture
Future Likelihood of Successful Cyberattacks
Figure 5: Percentage indicating compromise is “more likely to occur than not” in the next 12 months.
In a 2019 study published by the National Academy of Sciences 
of the United States, Boston\-area scientists found that the most 
optimistic people live an average of 11\-15% longer than their 
more pessimistic peers. While most view optimism to be a healthy 
trait, we’re not so sure that mentality bodes well for cybersecurity 
professionals. And our CDR respondents certainly agree.
When we first asked the question at the top of this page for 
our 2014 CDR, only 38\.1% felt like a successful cyberattack in 
the coming year was more likely than not. Fast forward to last 
November when our survey was live, and that number nearly 
doubled to 75\.6% (see Figure 5\). Now, considering that 86\.2% 
of organizations were victimized by successful attacks last year, 
75\.6% actually reflects a degree of optimism that the coming 12

What is the likelihood that your organization’s network will be compromised by a successful 
cyberattack in 2021?

months will see an improvement. But over time, cybersecurity 
professionals have come to realize that it’s more of a question 
of when their organization will be victimized by a data breach 
than if. 
On an industry basis, the proportion of respondents saying 
a compromise was more likely to occur than not was highest 
in manufacturing (80\.0%), retail (78\.0%), and telecom and 
technology (75\.6%). The most confident respondents 
(relatively) were in healthcare (63\.8%) and government (70\.9%) 
(see Figure 6\). 
Of the 17 countries we surveyed, the majority of respondents 
in each one felt that a successful cyberattack on their employer 
was more likely than not. Respondents in China were the 
most pessimistic, and in fact the percentage there expecting a 
successful attack soared from 63\.3% last year to 90\.0% this year. 
Respondents in Australia and the United States also turned 
much more pessimistic, with those expecting successful attacks 
rising from 70\.0% to 86\.0% and from 71\.6% to 82\.1%, respec­
tively. Respondents in Brazil (52\.9%), South Africa (54\.2%), and 
Italy (56\.0%) were the least pessimistic. 
So, how can IT security organizations channel all of this 
pessimism toward a positive outcome? Well, you can start by 
planning for the worst while still hoping for the best. Specifically, 
smart IT security teams should:
v Invest in modern malware detection and cyberthreat hunting 
technologies that leverage machine learning (ML) and 
artificial intelligence (AI)
v Select security analytics solutions that can quickly help you 
determine whether any data was compromised/leaked 
v Adopt security orchestration, automation, and response 
(SOAR) technology that enables security teams to work more 
cohesively and accomplish more with fewer resources
v Pre\-determine policies and procedures to accelerate recovery 
from ransomware and other attacks
v Invest in training and certification as tactics for both 
recruitment and retention to help close that IT security 
skills gap
Long gone are the days of evaluating cybersecurity professionals 
solely on their abilities to prevent data breaches from occurring. 
These days, IT security teams are evaluated on their abilities to 
rapidly detect, validate, investigate, terminate, and recover from 
cyberattacks.

Section 1: Current Security Posture
On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate your organization’s overall security posture 
(ability to defend against cyberthreats) for each of the following IT components:
Security Posture by IT Domain
Figure 7: Perceived security posture by IT domain.
The IT security component rated most challenging to secure this 
year is mobile devices (see Figure 7\). That’s up from fourth last 
year. The reason for the jump? Two words: COVID and BYOD.
Last year, CyberEdge published a multi\-sponsor survey report 
titled, “The Impact of COVID\-19 on Enterprise IT Security Teams” 
(see page 55\). Upon surveying 600 IT security professionals 
regarding how the pandemic has affected their practices and 
security investments, we learned that the number of organi­
zations with bring\-your\-own\-device (BYOD) policies jumped 
nearly 60% due to the massive, almost\-overnight increase in 
remote workers. These mobile devices were largely, if not almost 
entirely, unmanaged with few or no security protections. 
Next in line are Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which in the 
context of business equate to copiers, VoIP phones, building 
automation systems, closed\-circuit TV (CCTV) systems, climate 
control systems, alarm systems, and more. Each of these 
IP\-enabled components has an operating system, an application, 
and the potential for exploitable vulnerabilities.
The third type of IT component that causes the most security 
concerns includes industrial control systems (ICS) and SCADA 
devices. These devices are commonly used by manufacturers, 
electric power generators, nuclear power plants, chemical 
manufacturers, oil refineries, and water and wastewater

treatment facilities. Just like IoT devices, each has an operating 
system and an application with potentially exploitable 
vulnerabilities. 
On a positive note, servers, websites and web applications, 
and datastores are of lesser concern, most likely because these 
are static assets that can be more easily monitored. Cloud 
applications used to be a significant headache for IT security 
teams. But with modern\-day cloud access security broker (CASB) 
capabilities often baked into next\-generation firewall (NGFW) 
and secure web gateway (SWG) solutions, the “shadow IT” 
phenomenon has declined significantly as an issue. 
So, in the grand scheme of things, how do this year’s overall 
security posture assessments compare to last year’s? Well, of the 
13 IT components depicted in this survey question, confidence 
has declined in 12\. 
Section 1: Current Security Posture
“The IT security component rated
most challenging to secure this year is
mobile devices. That’s up from fourth
last year. The reason for the jump?
Two words: COVID and BYOD.” 
The only IT component that respondents are more bullish about 
defending this year is application containers, which rose to \#9 
on the list from \#13 last year. Kudos to those innovative security 
vendors who’ve launched new solutions to safeguard Docker, 
Kubernetes, and other application container platforms. Our 
proverbial hats are off to you!
In case you’re wondering, IT components that reflect the greatest 
drop in safeguarding confidence are:
v Network perimeter / DMZ (public web servers) (\-0\.12\)
v Mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) (\-0\.11\)
v Internet of Things (IoT) (\-0\.08\)

Section 1: Current Security Posture
On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate the adequacy of your organization’s capabilities 
in each of the following functional areas of IT security:
Assessing IT Security Functions
Figure 8: Perceived adequacy of functional security capabilities.
In this question, we presented a list of 11 IT security functions 
and asked respondents to rate the adequacy of their capabilities 
(see Figure 8\). We added three new IT security functions to the 
list this year:
v Third\-party risk management (TPRM)
v Brand protection
v Governance, risk and compliance (GRC)
We’d sure like to thank our sponsors that play in the TPRM space 
for encouraging us to add it to the list because, as it turns out, 
TPRM is the IT security function rated most challenging this year! 
And it makes sense, given several high\-profile data breaches that 
have stemmed from victims’ partners, suppliers, and contractors. 
Companies that suffered breaches included Target (2013\), Home 
Depot (2014\), Capital One (2019\), Quest Diagnostics (2019\), 
Facebook (2019\), Marriott (2020\), and General Electric (2020\). 
And let’s not forget about FireEye, Microsoft, VMware, and dozens 
of other companies affected by last year’s SolarWinds zero\-day 
vulnerability.
Attack surface reduction – which includes vulnerability 
management, patch management, security configuration 
management, and penetration testing – was rated as the 
second\-biggest challenge this year. In our humble opinions, too 
many organizations underinvest in this critically important area. 
If security teams were more efficient at finding and mitigating 
security risks, we wouldn’t need to rely as much on “next\-gen”

threat detection technologies because so many cyberthreats 
would be rendered harmless if the vulnerabilities they were 
designed to exploit were already patched.
The functional area with the greatest decline in confidence over 
the past year was incident investigation and response, which fell 
three places on our list. There are two reasons why we believe 
this is a direct result of the massive, almost\-overnight increases 
in remote workers and BYOD policy adoptions (see page 55\) 
stemming from the COVID\-19 pandemic. First, we already 
know that the sheer volume of cyberthreats increased last year, 
resulting in a record number of successful attacks. This equates to 
an increased volume of incidents to investigate and remediate. 
Second, it’s far more challenging to investigate employee\-owned, 
unmanaged devices than company\-owned laptops and 
smartphones.
Brand protection is a new entrant to our list this year and is 
also the newest IT security function to get on CISOs’ radar. In 
the context of cybersecurity, it relates to protecting intellectual 
property (IP) of companies and their associated brands against 
counterfeiting, copyright piracy, trademark squatting, patent 
theft, rogue websites, and social media impersonation. As this 
Section 1: Current Security Posture
“We’d sure like to thank our sponsors for 
encouraging us to add TPRM to the list,
because it is the IT security function rated
most challenging this year!” 
security capability is still emerging, it naturally ranks high on the 
list of most\-challenging IT security functions. Thankfully, several 
security vendors have rolled out brand protection solutions that 
help track down and shut down fraudulent activities on the web.
From there, the next set of IT security functions are rated 
pretty close together. The security function that IT security 
organizations are most bullish about – despite being among 
the hardest to do well – is security engineering/architecture and 
design. Kudos to all of the security architects out there who are 
helping to make smart investments to keep their organizations 
safe (or as safe as they can be).

Section 1: Current Security Posture
Select the roles/areas for which your organization is currently experiencing a shortfall of skilled IT security 
personnel. (Select all that apply.) 
The IT Security Skills Shortage
Figure 9: Percent of organizations experiencing a shortfall of skilled IT 
security personnel.
If there was ever a year when we needed plenty of skilled 
IT security personnel, it was 2020 – when the tidal wave of 
remote workers and new BYOD policy adoptions occurred. IT 
security teams had to immediately figure out how to more than 
double remote access capacity and secure unmanaged devices 
practically overnight.
Unfortunately, nearly nine in 10 organizations (87%) experienced 
a shortfall in IT security personnel last year (see Figure 9\), which 
is a new CDR record and a 2\.2% increase from the previous year. 
Two percentage points don’t seem like a lot, but overworked 
security professionals definitely felt the impact of being thrown 
into the fire to contend with the ripple effect of the pandemic 
(i.e., more unmanaged devices, larger attack surface, increased 
cyberthreats, and more incidents to investigate).
To add insult to injury, many organizations (especially in 
the travel, leisure, and hospitality industries) were forced to 
reduce workforce spending, including IT security staffing. As a 
result, many IT security teams had to contend with furloughs, 
reductions in hours, and layoffs.
If we break down the data by role, we see the greatest shortfalls 
in IT security are IT security administrators (40\.4%), who 
are responsible for installing, configuring, monitoring, and 
maintaining IT security infrastructure components. Next are IT 
security analysts, operators, and incident responders (35\.0%). 
These workers are on the front line of monitoring the organi­
zation for potential data breaches and other attacks. IT security 
architects and engineers were at the top of last year’s list of job 
shortages; however, this group has fallen to third position this 
year at 32\.6% (see Figure 10\).
Surprisingly, DevSecOps engineers (25\.7%) are least in demand. 
It’s not because IT security organizations haven’t embraced 
DevSecOps, as this year’s CDR shows an impressive 93% of 
“Unfortunately, nearly nine in 10 organizations 
(87%) experienced a shortfall in IT security 
personnel last year, which is a new CDR record.”

organizations have implemented, or are starting to implement, 
DevSecOps practices (see page 49\). The most likely reason for 
this seeming contradiction is that many enterprises are training 
application developers and testers to integrate security into their 
jobs, rather than hiring people with DevSecOps titles.
Just like last year, IT security skill shortages are felt the hardest 
by organizations with 10,000 to 24,999 employees (91%). 
Organizations with only 1,000 to 4,999 employees (85\.1%) are 
not as impacted but still are definitely feeling the pain like 
everyone else.
Figure 10: Cybersecurity skills shortage, by role.
 ■ 2021 ■ 2020
With regard to major industries, telecom and technology (89\.6%), 
retail (87\.4%), and healthcare (87\.3%) are the most affected by 
the shortage. Education (83\.6%) and government (83\.7%) are the 
least affected.
Around the world, we found the greatest shortages in Japan 
(whoa… 98\.0%), Singapore (93\.9%), and Canada (89\.8%). IT 
security teams in Brazil (76\.5%), China (80\.0%), and the United 
Kingdom (81\.4%) are faring a little better than the 87\.0% 
global average.

Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns
On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate your overall concern for each of the following types of 
cyberthreats targeting your organization. 
Concern for Cyberthreats
Figure 11: Relative concern for cyberthreats by type.
Of the 12 classes of cyberthreats we track each year, concern for 
malware has been atop the list for six straight years (see Figure 
11\). According to the 2020 Verizon Data Breach Investigations 
Report (DBIR), 17% of the data breaches researched for that 
report involved malware. So, it makes sense that malware, once 
again, achieved the highest 1\-to\-5 rating with a score of 4\.04\.
The next two classes of cyberthreats – ransomware (3\.99\) and 
phishing/spear\-phishing attacks (3\.99\) – have appeared in the 
top three for the last four years. This year, they tied for second 
place, closely followed by account takeover/credential abuse 
attacks (3\.98\) and denial of service (DoS/DDoS) attacks (3\.98\), 
which tied for fourth place.
“IT security professionals are 
more concerned about cyberthreats
than ever before.” 
The biggest gainer in this year’s CDR is advanced persistent 
threats (APTs)/targeted attacks (3\.97\), up 0\.10 from last year. The 
next biggest gainer is web application attacks (3\.94\), up 0\.09 
from last year.

At the bottom of the list for the second straight year is zero\-day 
attacks (3\.86\), as it should be, since less than 1% of registered 
vulnerabilities in MITRE’s CVE database originate as zero\-day 
vulnerabilities in any given year. Plus, security vendors have made 
incredible strides over the years at detecting never\-before\-seen 
cyberthreats without the use of threat signatures. First, it was 
sandboxing and now it’s ML and AI algorithms to the rescue. 
As a reminder, respondents completed our survey in November 
2020, about a month before the world learned of the infamous 
SolarWinds zero\-day attacks that wreaked havoc on hundreds of 
commercial and government agencies around the globe. Next 
year’s CDR survey will be conducted in November 2021\. It will be 
interesting to see whether concern for zero\-day attacks lingers 11 
months after the SolarWinds catastrophe.
One class of cyberthreat that we want to keep our eyes on in the 
years ahead is brand reputation attacks (3\.87\). We added this to 
the list last year and it remains in second\-to\-last position. But we 
believe that this low level of concern may be an “ignorance is 
bliss” phenomenon, as monitoring social media and the web for 
hijacked and/or impersonated social media accounts, counterfeit 
goods websites, and fraudulent websites will become more of a 
concern in the cybersecurity community as:
v Incidents become more frequent and serious
v Marketing discovers these concerns and asks IT for help 
v Digital risk protection (DRP) and brand protection solutions 
become more prevalent
Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns
Figure 12: Threat Concern Index, depicting overall concern for 
cyberthreats.
Finally, with all of the chaos that IT security professionals 
experienced last year stemming from the COVID\-19 pandemic 
(see page 55\), how has overall concern for all classes of cyber­
threats changed from a year ago? CyberEdge’s “Threat Concern 
Index” averages the 1\-to\-5 ratings across all 12 cyberthreat 
classes to produce a single composite rating (see Figure 12\). In 
our 2020 CDR, the Threat Concern Index rating was 3\.89, a new 
record at the time. This year, that record has been broken with a 
rating of 3\.94\. Put another way, IT security professionals are more 
concerned about cyberthreats than ever before.

Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns
Which of the following attacks on your web and mobile applications are most concerning? 
(Select up to three.)
Concern for Web and Mobile Attacks
Figure 13: Most\-concerning web and mobile application attacks.
Because attacks on web and mobile applications continue to rise, 
we added a new question to this year’s CDR survey. From the five 
most common types of web and mobile application attacks, we 
asked respondents to select up to three that concern them the 
most. The results are insightful (see Figure 13\).
Atop the list, as no surprise to many, is account takeover attacks 
(43\.7%), which commonly use a technique called “credential 
stuffing.” This is an automated attack that uses breached 
username/password pairs to fraudulently gain access to 
consumer or business user accounts. 
“Our data also confirmed that web an
 mobile attacks are pervasive. More than nine 
out of 10 organizations surveyed reported 
being affected by cyberattacks targeting web 
and mobile applications.”

Here’s how it works:
1\. The attacker acquires usernames and passwords from the 
dark web following a website data breach.
2\. The attacker uses automated bots to test the stolen 
credentials against retail e\-commerce, financial services, and 
social media websites, or alternately against the websites of 
targeted enterprises.
3\. Successful logins (usually around 0\.1% to 0\.2% of total 
login attempts) allow the attacker to take over the account 
matching the stolen credentials.
4\. The attacker exfiltrates credit card numbers and other 
personally identifiable information (PII) from a consumer’s 
account, or leverages a business user’s credentials to obtain 
privileged access, move laterally through the enterprise’s 
data center and cloud applications, and steal intellectual 
property, personal information, financial account numbers, 
and other goodies.
Next on the list is PII harvesting (39\.7%), which involves 
exploiting security vulnerabilities in JavaScript or other 
third\-party code components. Security flaws in client\-side 
code provide attackers the means of injecting malicious code 
designed to gain access to the user data at the point of entry, 
including PII such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, 
credit card numbers, and more.
Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns
In third place is malicious browser extensions (37\.6%). These 
are malicious programs posing as third\-party web browser 
extensions linked to popular social media and online shopping 
sites such as Facebook, Rakuten, and Honey. These extensions, 
commonly written in JavaScript, are designed to exfiltrate 
information about the user or to download and execute 
malicious code.
Rounding out the list are the bottom three:
v Carding/payment fraud attacks (35\.3%), where attackers use 
bots to test lists of recently stolen credit/debit card details on 
merchant websites
v Digital skimming/Magecart attacks (29\.6%), where attackers 
inject malicious code into third\-party JavaScript to steal 
credit card data
v Unauthorized ad injections (23\.0%), where attackers (often 
through malicious browser extensions) inject banner ads that 
replace or overlay original, legitimate ads and redirect users 
to malicious websites
Our data also confirmed that web and mobile attacks are 
pervasive. More than nine out of 10 organizations surveyed 
(91%) reported being affected by cyberattacks targeting web 
and mobile applications.

Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns
If victimized by ransomware in the past 12 months, did your organization pay a ransom
(using Bitcoins or other anonymous currency) to recover data? 
Responding to Ransomware 
Ransomware is unrelenting! The past 12 months saw a record\-
setting number of successful ransomware attacks. According to 
this year’s CDR research, 68\.5% of organizations were affected by 
one or more successful ransom attacks (see Figure 14\). That’s an 
all\-time high, up from 62\.4% last year. 
Why the continuing surge in attacks? Here at CyberEdge, we 
think it may be the result of a three interacting trends, illustrated 
in Figure 15\. 
The first trend is that the percentage of organizations that 
successfully recovered their data following a ransom payment is 
at an all\-time high of 71\.6%, up from 66\.8% a year ago. But this 
is a double\-edged sword. The more confident organizations are 
that they will recover their data upon paying ransoms, the more

likely they’ll be to actually pay the ransoms. That percentage has 
risen over the past two years to the 57% range. Finally, the trend 
of more organizations paying ransoms motivates cybercriminals 
to increase their volume of ransomware attacks, which means 
another surge in the number of ransomware victims. This is a 
vicious cycle that, unfortunately, doesn’t seem likely to be broken 
anytime soon.
Another trend – toward exponentially higher ransom payments – 
is elevating ransomware to the status of a bona fide catastrophe 
for many victims. According to research by Coveware, a 
ransomware incident response vendor, average ransomware 
payments increased 1,732% between the first quarter of 2019 
and the third quarter of 2020, from $12,762 to $233,817 (see 
Figure 16\). The average fell unexpectedly in the fourth quarter of 
2020, to $154,108\. Perhaps organizations are saying “no more,” or 
perhaps they are negotiating more effectively with the cyber­
criminals. Regardless, while a $12,000 payment two years ago 
was a nuisance, a $154,000 ransom today can be a serious blow 
to small businesses, hospitals, school districts, local government 
agencies, and other small and medium\-sized organizations that 
have recently become the target of choice for ransomware. 
Other notable findings from this year’s CDR regarding successful 
ransomware attacks include:
v Australia (79\.6%), the United States (78\.5%), and Saudi 
Arabia (77\.6%) were the countries most affected, while Japan 
(56\.0%), Singapore (57\.1%), and the United Kingdom (57\.9%) 
were least affected (see Figure 17\).
v The most severely affected major industries were telecom 
and technology (75\.4%) and education (72\.7%), while the 
least affected were government (50\.0%) and healthcare 
(59\.4%) (see Figure 18\).
v When the data is broken down by organization size, those 
with more than 25,000 employees fared the best (56\.9%). 
Organizations with employee numbers ranging from 500 to 
9,999 were about equally affected (range of 68\.6% to 70\.6%).
Figure 16: Average ransom payments, by quarter (data source: Coveware 
Quarterly Ransomware Reports). 
In September of last year, for a brief period, we thought we 
had seen the world’s first death by cyberattack. A woman in 
Düsseldorf, Germany, with a life\-threatening condition had to be 
transported to a hospital in Wuppertal 30 kilometers (19 miles) 
away because the local hospital in Düsseldorf was victimized by a 
ransomware attack. The attack compromised 30 of the hospital’s 
servers, which prevented it from processing new patients. 
Unfortunately, that woman died. 
At first, the media touted the occurrence as the first fatality 
caused by a cyberattack. But two months later, German 
authorities concluded that the delay in transport was not a 
contributing factor in the patient’s death. 
Given steady increases in successful attacks in the multi\-billion\-
dollar ransomware industry, many of which affect hospitals, will 
2021 be the first year we witness death by cyberattack?

Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns
On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being most serious, rate how each of the following inhibit your organization from 
adequately defending itself against cyberthreats.
Barriers to Establishing Effective Defenses
Figure 19: Inhibitors to establishing effective cyberthreat defenses.
Each year, we ask respondents to tell us what’s inhibiting them 
from adequately defending their organizations against cyber­
threats. What’s standing in the way of their success? Is it lack of 
budget? Inadequate security defenses? 
Our two perennial leaders, low security awareness among 
employees and lack of skilled personnel, remain atop the list this 
year (see Figure 19\). They highlight two longstanding problems 
that have plagued security teams for years.
First, too many organizations only train employees once – when 
they join the company or government agency \-\- on how to avoid 
falling victim to cyberattacks. Smart security teams do things 
differently. They provide all employees with ongoing security 
“Smart security teams are investing
in IT security training and certification as both
a recruiting and a retention tool.”

awareness training. Also, they employ simulated phishing 
platforms. These send harmless phishing emails to employees 
every month to expose carelessness and educate potential 
victims on the importance of constant vigilance. Both initiatives 
dramatically increase security awareness and reduce risks of 
ransomware and successful data breaches
Second, we previously learned that 87% of organizations 
experienced an IT security skills shortfall last year (see page 15\). 
Smart security teams are investing in IT security training and 
certification as both a recruiting and a retention tool. Also, we 
know that 81% of IT security professionals would like to work 
from home part or all of the time. By relaxing requirements to 
report to the office every day, a sensible work\-from\-home policy 
can improve job satisfaction and make it a little easier to recruit 
the security personnel you’re looking for.
Third on this year’s list of inhibitors is poor integration/interop­
erability between security solutions, up from the number six 
position last year. This factor is also responsible for this year’s 
highest rating change (0\.17 increase). Nobody wants security 
solutions that work in isolation. The best security solutions share 
intelligence and perform functions with other security solutions, 
even if they are provided by different vendors.
On the opposite end of the spectrum is lack of budget. It is once 
again at the bottom of the list despite the fact that, as we’ll later 
learn, security is now consuming a slightly smaller percentage of 
the overall IT budget (see page 29\) and IT security budgets this 
year are not rising as much as in previous years (see page 31\). 
If you average out all of the 1\-to\-5 ratings from research partici\-
pants for all 10 of the inhibitors represented in our survey, you 
get a single number. That number is represented in our Security 
Concern Index (see Figure 20\). This is a way for us to gauge how 
stressed IT security professionals are from one year to the next. 
Are things getting worse or are they getting better?
Well, this year’s Security Concern Index is 3\.65, which is an 
all\-time high, up from 3\.53 a year ago. And for the second 
consecutive year, all 10 inhibitor ratings increased year\-over\-year. 
Of course, given all of the personal and professional challenges 
stemming from the COVID\-19 pandemic over the last year, it’s no 
wonder stress levels are through the roof. Many security team 
members have been asked to do more with fewer resources 
– while at home with screaming kids in the background. Once 
again, our proverbial hats are off to IT security professionals 
everywhere.

Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns
Which of the following have been the biggest benefits of leveraging a unified platform for application 
and data security defenses (e.g., WAF, DDoS protection, RASP, API security, data risk analytics, database 
security)? (Select up to three.)
Benefits of Unified App and Data Security Defenses
Figure 21: Benefits achieved by unifying application and data security defenses.
If you ran an ice cream parlor, it would be unrealistic (and 
colossally stupid) to source your chocolate ice cream from one 
supplier, your vanilla ice cream from another, and your strawberry 
ice cream from a third. There are enormous efficiencies to be 
gained from sourcing all your ice cream flavors from one supplier. 
We believe this same concept holds true for application and data 
security defenses. Sure, there are pure play API security vendors, 
and pure play risk analytics vendors, and pure play database 
security vendors. But wouldn’t it be great if you could source 
all of your application and data security defenses from a single 
vendor? Our respondents think so.
We asked our respondents to select up to three benefits of 
unifying their application and data security defenses within a 
single platform. The results are insightful (see Figure 21\). 
At the top of the list is simplified security monitoring (50\.0%). 
Security analysts have one pane of glass to stare at instead of 
many. Next is an improved customer support experience (41\.6%), 
which makes perfect sense as security administrators have 
one number to call when they need technical assistance. Third 
is simplified administration and reporting (39\.2%). A unified 
platform means one management interface and one set of 
reports for all application and data security concerns.
The three remaining benefits are reduced cost (36\.6%), simplified 
third\-party integration with key security tools like SIEMs (35\.5%), 
and a simpler acquisition process (30\.1%). It’s interesting to note 
that no single benefit achieved less than 30%. Our data reinforces 
the notion that smart security teams are selecting one reputable 
vendor that can satisfy all of their application and data security 
needs rather than sourcing solutions from two, three, or more 
niche vendors. The economies of scale are just too compelling.

Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns
Based on your organization’s current climate, which of the following types of cybersecurity certifications do 
you believe would be most beneficial to your career path? (Select up to three.)
Boosting Careers with Cybersecurity Certifications
Figure 22: Types of specialty cybersecurity professional certifications deemed most beneficial to IT security career paths.
CyberEdge has always been a huge proponent of IT security 
training and certification. Our founder and CEO, Steve Piper, 
has maintained his CISSP certification from (ISC)2 for more than 
a decade. And many of CyberEdge’s research and marketing 
consultants have earned cybersecurity certifications from (ISC)2 
and other prominent providers. Last year, CyberEdge surveyed 
600 IT security professionals to assess how the pandemic has 
affected their respective security teams (see page 55\). One of the 
valuable lessons we learned is that 78% of those respondents

is the specialty security certification most 
sought after today by IT professionals (51\.2%).”

felt their IT security professional certifications better equipped 
them to meet the cybersecurity challenges they faced during the 
pandemic.
So, being proponents of IT security training and certification, 
we asked the 1,200 respondents to this year’s CDR to select 
up to three of nine cybersecurity certification types that they 
believe would be beneficial to their career paths. Nearly all of our 
respondents (99%) acknowledged that achieving at least one 
cybersecurity certification would help their career (see Figure 22\).
It makes perfect sense that cloud security is the specialty security 
certification most sought after today by IT professionals (51\.2%). 
One of the most notable paradigm shifts in the IT security 
industry in recent years is the move from on\-premises appli­
cations and security packages to cloud\-hosted applications and 
cloud\-native security solutions. In last year’s COVID\-19 impact 
study, a whopping 75% of respondents said the pandemic 
Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns
affected their preferences for cloud\-based security solutions. 
Later in this report, we’ll see that the percentage of security 
applications and services delivered via the cloud increased 
substantially from a year ago (see page 47\).
The second most sought\-after specialty cybersecurity certifi­
cation is software security (50\.0%), which relates to another 
paradigm shift in cybersecurity thinking. Eliminating vulnera­
bilties during coding is an extremely cost\-effective way to reduce 
your attack surface.
In third place is security administration (38\.3%), which is partic­
ularly timely since the IT security role in greatest demand this 
year is IT security administrator (see page 16\). Beyond that, the 
six remaining specialty certifications, while relevant to specific 
job roles and industries, rate between 12\.8% (health care) and 
23\.1% (management).

What percentage of your employer’s IT budget is allocated to information security 
(e.g., products, services, personnel)? 
IT Security Budget Allocation
Figure 23: Percentage of IT budget allocated to information security, 
by year.
Each year we ask our CDR respondents to specify the percentage 
of their employer’s overall IT budget that is allocated to infor­
mation security. For the first time since we asked this question, 
four years ago, the percentage of IT budget allocated to security 
has gone down rather than up (see Figure 23\). Globally speaking, 
that percentage is 12\.7%, down from 12\.8% a year ago. Now, 
we’re only talking about one\-tenth of one percent. But the fact 
that this is our first\-ever decline is noteworthy.
We think the explanation for this change lies in the non\-security 
operational costs of supporting so many new remote workers 
created by COVID\-19\. Yes, organizations have increased their 
budgets for IT security (see page 31\), but they are also spending 
more on laptops, network connections, help desk support, and

other costs related to remote work. We don’t think the flattening 
of this trend represents less commitment to security, but rather 
a host of unavoidable expenses related to provisioning and 
supporting WFH and BYOD. 
Of course, the portion of IT budgets consumed by security varies 
by country, by industry, and by organization size. Let’s review 
statistics from each of these perspectives.
Geographically speaking, organizations from Brazil (15\.0%), 
Colombia (14\.7%), and Saudi Arabia (14\.0%) dedicate the largest 
portions of their respective IT budgets to security, while organi­
zations from Italy (10\.1%), Singapore (10\.5%), and Germany 
(10\.8%) assign the smallest. The United States, at 13\.7%, is a full 
percentage point higher than the global mean of 12\.7% (see 
Figure 24\).
From an industry perspective, education (13\.7%), telecom and 
technology (13\.2%), and finance (12\.8%) are above the global 
mean. Health care (11\.7%), government (11\.8%), manufacturing 
(11\.8%), and retail (12\.6%) are below it (see Figure 25\).
Finally, from a size perspective, smaller organizations with 
500\-999 employees (13\.4%) dedicate the largest portion of IT 
budget to security, while mid\-size enterprises with 5,000\-9,999 
employees (12\.2%) and 10,000\-24,999 employees (12\.1%) 
dedicate the smallest (see Figure 26\).
“For the first time since we asked
this question, the percentage of
IT budget allocated to security has
gone down rather than up.”

Do you expect your employer’s overall IT security budget to increase or decrease in 2021? 
IT Security Budget Change
Figure 27: Percentage of organizations with rising security budgets.
Every year for eight consecutive years, CyberEdge has asked IT 
security professionals whether their operating budgets were 
increasing or decreasing in the coming year, and by how much. 
For the first time in our CDR history, we’ve seen a decline in the 
percentage of organizations whose security budgets are rising 
(see Figure 27\).
Furthermore, this is a first\-ever decline in the amount of IT 
security budget increases (see Figure 28\). Over the preceding 
three years, IT security budgets have gone up by 4\.7%, 4\.9%, and 
5\.0%, respectively. This year, the average IT security budget is 
“only” going up by 4\.0%.
Now, before we all hit the panic button, let’s put this into 
perspective. First, we’re still in the midst of a global pandemic. 
Despite the progress that nations have made in distributing 
COVID\-19 vaccines, it’s not over yet. And some industries (e.g., 
hospitality and retail) have been harder hit by the pandemic than 
others (e.g., government and utilities). Second, we’re not saying 
that the average IT security budget has shrunk this year. Quite the 
contrary. In fact, more than three\-quarters (77\.8%) of IT security 
budgets have increased this year. It’s just that these budgets, on 
average, aren’t growing as fast as they have in the past.
Figure 28: Mean annual increase in IT security budgets.
From a regional perspective, IT security budgets in Brazil (\+5\.8%), 
South Africa (\+5\.0%), and Mexico (\+4\.8%) aren’t as adversely 
affected. However, IT security budgets in Spain (\+2\.8%), Canada 
(\+2\.9%), and Germany (\+3\.0%) have been harder hit. In the 
United States, average IT security budgets are rising by 3\.8% this 
year, just under the \+4\.0% global mean (see Figure 29\).
Looking at our seven major industries, healthcare (\+4\.8%), 
telecom and technology (\+4\.5%), and government (\+4\.2%) are 
all above the global mean. Retail (\+4\.0%) and finance (\+4\.0\) align 
with the global mean. Education (\+3\.2%) and manufacturing 
(\+3\.9%) are both below the global mean (see Figure 30\).
Organization size does not appear to be a major influencer with 
regard to 2021 IT security budget changes. Mid\-size enterprises 
with 5,000\-9,999 employees seem to have the most IT security 
budget growth (\+4\.5%), while the very largest enterprises with 
25,000 or more employees (\+3\.5%) are experiencing the smallest 
IT security budget growth (see Figure 31\).
In short, although the growth of IT security budgets has slowed, 
the IT security profession is a great place to be from a job security 
perspective.

How has the COVID\-19 pandemic affected your organization’s priorities for acquiring new IT security 
products and services?
COVID\-19 Effects on IT Security Purchase Priorities
Figure 32: Effects of the COVID\-19 pandemic on IT security spending priorities.
The COVID\-19 pandemic turned all of our lives upside 
down—both personally and professionally. From an IT security 
perspective, security teams had just finished budget planning at 
the end of 2019 and were starting to execute their plans in the 
first quarter of 2020\. Then all hell broke loose.
Once again, last year’s “The Impact of COVID\-19 on Enterprise 
IT Security Teams” yielded many valuable insights (see page 55\), 
including:
v 114% average increase in remote workers
v 59% increase in BYOD policies 
v Insufficient remote access capacity
v Massive increase in cyberthreats and security incidents
v 75% of respondents have increased their preference for 
cloud\-based security solutions
One question that we didn’t ask in that report is how the 
pandemic affected the big picture with regard to IT security 
spending priorities. As you can imagine, the pandemic had a 
significant effect (see Figure 32\). In fact, just over half (50\.5%) 
of organizations said the pandemic triggered a major re\-
prioritization of new IT security investments, while 35\.8%

reported some spending re\-prioritization. Only 13\.7% – we’ll call 
them the lucky ones – felt the pandemic had no impact on their 
IT security spending priorities.
From an industry perspective, the organizations where major 
re\-prioritization was required were more common in finance 
(54\.5%) and manufacturing, while organizations in the 
government (32\.0%) and healthcare (34\.8%) sectors were not 
as impacted (see Figure 33\).
From a geographical perspective, organizations in Turkey (68\.0%), 
Mexico (66\.7%), Colombia (60\.6%), and the United States (60\.2%) 
experienced the highest incidence of major changes in spending 
priorities. Organizations in Canada (30\.6%), the United Kingdom 
(31\.6%), and Germany (35\.1%) were not as affected as much.

priorities last year to accommodate a massive increase in remote 
workers, to secure a plethora of unmanaged personal devices, 
and to deal with a massive increase in cyberthreats and other 
security risks. Let’s all be grateful that the end of this pandemic is 
near so life can return to at least some semblance of normalcy.

Which of the following network security technologies are currently in use or planned for acquisition 
(within 12 months) by your organization? 
Network Security Deployment Status
Table 1: Network security technologies in use and planned for acquisition.
Security technologies are the foundation of IT security programs. 
But it can be difficult to decide which of the many choices to 
prioritize. Certainly it would be helpful to know what your peers 
think. What cybersecurity products and services are must\-haves? 
Which are the up\-and\-comers needed to fill gaps and address 
emerging threats? Are some technologies more hype than 
reality?
In this section and the four that follow, we enable you to compare 
your organization’s current and planned usage of common 
security technologies against those of 1,200 of your peers around 
the globe – starting with network security technologies.The first 
column depicts the percentage of responding organizations that 
are currently using each technology in production. The middle 
column portrays organizations that are planning to acquire the 
technology this year. The last column reflects organizations that 
haven’t firmed up their plans yet. 
To make the results easier to absorb, we color\-coded the cells. 
Dark blue highlights technologies that are widely used now or 
are most likely to be deployed soon. Lighter shades indicate 
lower adoption levels and fewer planned acquisitions. The cells 
with the “no plans” percentages are gray. 
Let’s start by examining which network security technology 
is most widely used these days. In Table 1 we see only one

“It wouldn’t surprise us at all
if demand for DDoS prevention solutions
spiked after Amazon Web Services was hit by a 
gigantic DDoS attack in February 2020\.” 
Section 3: Current and Future Investments
year. We can remember when sandboxing first emerged 
as an enterprise\-class product, initially within on\-premises, 
purpose\-built appliances. But rapidly, sandboxing became a 
commoditized feature. It was often provided as an inexpensive 
cloud\-based add\-on to next\-generation firewalls (NGFWs), 
secure web gateways (SWGs), and secure email gateways (SEGs). 
Then, of course, the “bad guys” found ways to evade sandboxing 
analysis by suppressing malicious routines in files until a human 
later triggered them. 
That’s about the same time when security products featuring ML 
and AI algorithms designed to detect advanced and zero\-day 
threats arrived on the scene. Nowadays, organizations can’t 
afford to rely on network security technologies that feature 
signature\-based detection alone. That’s why advanced malware 
analysis boasts the highest combined adoption percentage 
(91\.7%) of organizations that are planning to acquire this 
technology or are already using it in production. This certainly 
augers well, as malware is the number\-one class of cyberthreat 
on the minds of security professionals this year (see page 17\).
Shifting gears, let’s examine which network security technology 
is at the top of most shopping lists this year. Once again, we’ve 
got one dark blue cell. This time, it’s NGFW. Although NGFWs 
have been around for more than a decade, not all organizations 
have realized the benefits of integrating firewall, intrusion 
prevention system (IPS), and application control technologies 
into one unified, single\-pass architecture. One potential “political” 
concern is firewall admins from network teams feeling they 
might lose administrative control to their security counterparts. 
But that really shouldn’t be an issue, especially since modern 
NGFWs provide role\-based access control so network and 
security personnel can maintain control over the NGFW settings 
and data that are most relevant to their respective roles.
In second place this year is DoS/DDoS prevention technology 
(38\.6%), which also represents the biggest year\-over\-year gainer 
with regard to acquisition plans. It wouldn’t surprise us at all if 
demand for DDoS prevention solutions spiked after Amazon 
Web Services was hit by a gigantic DDoS attack in February 2020\. 
Plus, have you heard about “extortion DDoS attacks” yet? It’s like 
ransomware meets DDoS. Thousands of organizations received 
emails last year from cybercrime syndicates demanding that 
Bitcoin ransoms be paid or else full\-scale DDoS attacks would 
follow. Some demonstrated their capabilities by committing 
pre\-emptive DoS attacks. While most organizations that rejected 
the ransom payment were unaffected, some were victimized by 
multivector DDoS floods, which peaked at around 200 Gbps.
In third place is deception technology/distributed honeypots 
(37\.2%). If you haven’t looked at this technology yet, do yourself a 
favor and check it out. It’s a smart and fairly easy way to uncover 
infiltration attempts by detecting would\-be invaders as they 
move laterally across your network or a simulated replica of your 
network. You gain not only valuable intelligence on your cyber­
adversaries, but also the ability to sever their connections to your 
network mid\-attack.
That wraps up this year’s network security buying intentions. 
Next up is endpoint security (see page 37\).

Which of the following endpoint security technologies are currently in use or planned for acquisition 
(within 12 months) by your organization? 
Endpoint Security Deployment Status
Table 2: Endpoint security technologies in use and planned for acquisition.
We repeated the same approach used to assess adoption of 
network security technologies to gain insight into deployment 
status and acquisition plans for endpoint security technologies 
(see Table 2\). As with Table 1, percentages in dark blue 
correspond to a higher frequency of adoption and acquisition 
plans, while those in light blue correspond to a lower frequency.
Once again, let’s start out by focusing our attention on the 
first column in the table and identify which endpoint security 
technology is most widely used. Likely not a surprise to anyone, 
basic signature\-based anti\-virus/anti\-malware (70\.5%) is at 
the top of the list – and probably won’t budge from that spot 
for many years to come. Although we all know that relying on 
signature\-based defenses alone is an exercise in futility, they 
do play a critical role by filtering out all of the easy (i.e., known) 
stuff so security solutions with more\-sophisticated capabilities 
aren’t overwhelmed as they detect more\-advanced threats that 
signature\-based defenses missed.
Let’s now discuss the endpoint security technology that is most 
sought\-after in 2021: deception technology/honeypot (41\.3%). 
As we mentioned in the network security section (see page 36\), 
deception technology provides a smart and fairly easy way to 
uncover infiltration attempts by detecting would\-be invaders as 
they move laterally across your network or a replica. Again, you 
not only gain valuable intelligence on your cyberadversaries, 
but also the ability to sever their connections to your network 
mid\-attack. User laptop and desktop computers dramatically

increase the quantity of potential “traps” that cyberattackers may 
fall into, improving the odds of detecting threats early.
Close behind deception technology/honeypot is browser or 
Internet isolation/micro\-virtualization technology (38\.3%). 
Browser isolation technology, in particular, has grown in 
popularity in recent years – no doubt sparked by the use of 
so many unmanaged devices during the pandemic. Instead 
of viewing content accessed via the Internet using local appli­
cations, users open content within applications in the cloud. 
This change is seamless to users, who view the applications 
as if they were running locally. This approach prevents client 
operating systems and applications from being accessed and 
“Demand for browser isolation technology
has increased so much that it boasts the
biggest ‘change in use’ gain among
all other endpoint security technologies 
depicted in this study.”
compromised by malware. Because browser isolation services are 
cloud\-based, they are a good fit for organizations that want to 
move more security solutions to the cloud. Demand for browser 
isolation technology has increased so much that it boasts the 
biggest “change in use” gain among all other endpoint security 
technologies depicted in this study. 
In third place this year is advanced anti\-virus/anti\-malware 
technology (36\.1%) equipped with ML, behavior monitoring, 
and/or sandboxing mechanisms. This technology complements 
traditional, signature\-based endpoint defenses by detecting 
advanced and zero\-day threats that those defenses miss. 
Sometimes this technology operates as a standalone endpoint 
detection and response (EDR) solution, while at other times it is 
integrated with a full\-fledged endpoint protection platform (EPP) 
offering.
Now that we’ve covered endpoint security technologies most 
in demand this year, let’s explore application\- and data\-centric 
security technologies (see page 39\).

comes to application and data security. As DevSecOps adoption 
continues to soar (see page 49\), several other technologies on 
this list will gain traction, such as SAST/DAST/IAST (48\.6%) and 
RASP (48\.2%) testing tools. 
With regard to what’s hot on this year’s application and data 
security shopping list, a new CDR entrant, bot management, 
takes the top spot (40\.4%). This rising star technology protects 
your websites, mobile applications, and APIs from automated 
attacks, helping to mitigate the risk of data breaches while 
improving operational efficiency. It can help prevent a variety 
of modern cyberthreats, including account takeover attacks, 
carding attacks, and business logic attacks such as inventory 
hoarding and content scraping (see page 19\).
Second on this year’s list is file integrity/activity monitoring (FIM/
FAM), an “oldie but goodie” in the application and data security 
industry. FIM provides an essential layer of defense that helps 
detect illicit activity across critical file systems so security teams 
can shut down attacks before they have a chance to cause 
damage. FAM discovers and monitors sensitive data (e.g., credit 
card numbers, Social Security numbers) on servers and can 
provide an early warning upon detecting a potential data breach.
In third place this year are the aforementioned SAST/DAST/
IAST application security testing tools (38\.2%) – staples among 
DevSecOps professionals. Although ranked a little lower on this 
year’s application security wish list, demand for RASP (35\.9%) is 
also growing. If you are unfamiliar with these acronyms, read on:
v 
Static application security testing (SAST), also known as 
“white box testing,” allows developers to uncover security 
vulnerabilities in application source code early in the software 
development life cycle.
v Dynamic application security testing (DAST), also known as 
“black box testing,” is designed to discover security vulnera­
bilities within a running web application after the software 
development life cycle is complete.
v Interactive application security testing (IAST) combines 
elements of both SAST and DAST approaches by placing an 
agent within the application that performs all of its analysis 
inside the app in real time at any point during the software 
development life cycle.
v The term “runtime application self\-protection” (RASP) was 
coined by Gartner in 2012\. It’s a security technology built 
into the application runtime environment that is capable 
of controlling application execution while detecting and 
preventing attacks in real time.
Now that we’ve delved into what’s hot in the application and 
data security space, let’s now dive into the world of security 
management and operations technologies (see page 41\).
“On this year’s application and data security 
shopping list, a new CDR entrant, bot 
management, takes the top spot (40\.4%).”

Security Management and Operations Deployment Status
Which of the following security management and operations technologies are currently in use or planned 
for acquisition (within 12 months) by your organization?
Table 4: Security management and operations technologies in use and planned for acquisition.
Next up, we have security management and operations. These 
technologies serve several important purposes, such as reducing 
an organization’s attack surface, detecting advanced threats, 
and automating key security operational functions. As usual, 
percentages in dark blue correspond to a higher frequency 
of adoption or acquisition plans, while those in light blue 
correspond to a lower frequency.
At the last Gartner Security and Risk Management Conference 
that CyberEdge participated in before COVID\-19 struck, one of 
the speakers presented three strategies for dramatically reducing 
cybersecurity risks – patch, patch, and patch. So, it’s no wonder 
why patch management (56\.7%) has appeared at the top of the 
“currently in use” column for three years running.

Advanced security analytics (56\.1%) equipped with ML and/or 
AI threat detection engines jumped from last place in 2019 to 
second place in 2020\. This year, it remains in second place as one 
of the top cyberthreat hunting solutions in the industry, while 
security configuration management (55\.2%) remains a top\-three 
contender for the third consecutive year.
Let’s now explore the hottest security management and 
operations technologies planned for acquisition this year. At the 
tippy top of the list (sorry… had to…) for the second consecutive 
year is the threat intelligence platform, or TIP (43\.5%). TIPs 
help automate, streamline, and simplify the entire process of 
researching, aggregating, and organizing threat intelligence 
data. There are multiple use cases for this compelling technology.

In our 2019 CDR, we asked our respondents to identify key 
motivations for deploying TIPs. They were:
v To improve our ability to detect cyberthreats (53\.7%)
v To improve our ability to validate security alerts (52\.9%)
v To improve our ability to prioritize responses to security 
alerts (43\.3%)
In second position this year is penetration testing (39\.9%), 
which accounts for the highest percentage increase in planned 
adoption this year. Penetration testing, sometimes called pen 
testing or ethical hacking, refers to the process of using hacking 
techniques to probe computer systems for vulnerabilities and 
security misconfigurations that hackers could exploit. 
Third on the list of hottest security management and operations 
technologies, for the second consecutive year, is full\-packet 
capture and analysis (38\.8%). In our view, this is the “microwave 
oven” of security tools. Before the microwave oven came along, 
our parents didn’t realize how life\-changing this appliance would 
be. Similarly, once you start using a full\-packet capture and 
analysis tool, you’ll soon forget what life was like before it arrived. 
That’s because it’s such a powerful tool for detecting advanced 
threats, validating security incidents, and assessing the impact of 
a successful cyberattack.
That covers the highlights of security management and 
operations technologies. One more category to go – identity 
and access management (see page 43\).

Identity and Access Management Deployment Status
Which of the following identity and access management (IAM) technologies are currently in use or planned 
for acquisition (within 12 months) by your organization?
Table 5: Identity and access management technologies in use and planned for acquisition.
As we hit the home stretch of security technology investments, 
we turn to the innovative world of identity and access 
management, or IAM, a staple of every IT security organization. 
As mentioned on more than one occasion (five, actually), 
percentages in dark blue correspond to a higher frequency 
of adoption or acquisition plans, while those in light blue 
correspond to a lower frequency.
Leaping to the top of the currently\-in\-use list, from eighth 
place last year to first place this year, is adaptive/risk\-based 
authentication (56\.3%), also known as step\-up authentication.

asks users for specific credentials whenever they log in or access 
corporate resources, adaptive/risk\-based authentication asks 
for different credentials depending on the situation. A low\-risk 
request from the user’s usual device might require a single, 
simple form of authentication, while a high\-risk transaction 
requested from an unusual device in a location new to the user 
might entail additional security questions, a code sent to a 
smartphone or email address, or a biometric signature. Adaptive/
risk\-based authentication reduces the friction for users trying to 
get their work done while providing additional security where 
appropriate.

Next on the currently\-in\-use list is password management/
automated reset (54\.6%), an important component of most 
IAM strategies for saving valuable IT administration cycles 
and improving user experiences. In third position is privileged 
account/access management (51\.4%), or PAM, which helps 
organizations prevent insider attacks and unauthorized privilege 
escalation while enforcing principles of least privilege. This is 
particularly important, because outside attackers and malicious 
insiders can wreak havoc if they secure the accounts of privileged 
users like executives and system administrators.
Section 3: Current and Future Investments
Regaining the number\-one spot on IAM shopping lists from two 
years ago is biometrics (40\.1%). Biometric technologies–such 
as fingerprint readers, facial recognition, iris recognition, hand 
geometry, and voice recognition–provide highly accurate, 
convenient, and hacker\-proof ways to authenticate user access to 
systems, applications, data, and physical locations. 
In second place on IAM shopping lists this year is federated 
identity management (37\.4%), which got bumped from 
first place last year. This technology helps enterprises and 
applications share identities so subscribers can use the same 
credentials to access various applications. It’s what enables you 
to log into so many websites with your Google or Facebook 
account.
In third place this year is single sign\-on (36\.6%), or SSO. SSO has 
been around for years, making it so much easier for workers 
to access disparate systems and applications using one set 
of credentials. SSO is tightly coupled with two\-/multi\-factor 
authentication (2FA/MFA) technology, providing an additional 
layer of IAM security.

Preferences for Machine Learning and AI
Select the option that best describes your organization’s overall preference for purchasing security products 
that feature machine learning (ML) and/or artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.
Figure 34: Preference for security products with machine learning and AI.
There’s no question about it. Machine learning and artificial 
intelligence algorithms in cybersecurity products are here to stay. 
Period. But while ML and AI are often used interchangeably, they 
refer to different things. Let’s break it down.
v AI is the ability of a system to complete tasks that are usually 
done by humans because they require human intelligence 
and discernment. 
v 
ML is a subset of AI and, in the context of cybersecurity, is 
arguably the most common method for achieving AI. ML 
gives systems the ability to learn from experience without 
any explicit programming or expertise. ML relies on special 
algorithms, such as decision trees, neural networks, and 
regression.
We benefit from ML in our everyday lives and may not realize it. 
Gmail now has a smart reply feature that suggests brief responses 
to whatever mail you’ve received based on the content present 
in the email. Netflix uses ML to constantly improve movie and TV 
show recommendations based on what customers have watched 
previously. Uber uses ML to determine how long it will take for

your driver to arrive. UberEATS does the same, but also factors 
in food preparation time based on your chosen restaurant. We 
could go on and on.
In the context of cybersecurity, ML and AI have improved our 
ability to:
v 
Discover new malware variants and zero\-day threats
v 
 
Improve detection of phishing and spear\-phishing emails
v 
Detect malicious network activity and stop attacks
v 
Uncover potential insider threats based on user behaviors
v 
Automate repetitive human tasks such as triaging incidents 
Let’s turn to the results of our survey question (see Figure 34\). For 
the second year, we asked our respondents to gauge their overall 
preference for purchasing security products that feature ML and/
or AI technology. And for the second straight year, the sum of 
those who indicated a strong preference (40\.5%) and a moderate 
preference (44\.8%) came to 85\.3%, exactly. Even the industries 
with the most interest (telecom and technology at 90\.2%) and 
least interest (government at 76\.0%) in security products that 
feature ML and/or AI were the same as last year (see Figure 35\). 
It’s almost like watching Bill Murray in Groundhog Day! (Yeah, we 
love that movie, too.)

Figure 35: Strong or moderate preference for security products with ma­
chine learning and AI, by industry.
Preferences for security products that feature ML and/or AI 
technologies by country did change a bit this year. Last year, ML 
and AI were all the rage in Turkey (100%). This year, respondents 
from Saudi Arabia (98\.0%) surpassed Turkish respondents (96\.0%) 
for the top honors. Respondents from France (73\.3%) 
and Germany (71\.6%) were less bullish (see Figure 36\).
As the results of this survey question are so close between 
our 2020 and 2021 CDRs, next year we’ll be asking a different 
question about ML and AI. Sorry… no Groundhog Day sequel 
next year.

Security Applications Delivered via the Cloud
What percentage of your information security applications and services is delivered via the cloud?
Figure 37: Percentage of 
security applications and 
services delivered via the cloud.
Before any of us knew what a coronavirus was, our industry was 
already experiencing a tidal wave of cloud\-based cybersecurity 
solutions. Not only solutions for monitoring security in the cloud 
(i.e., IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), but also solutions leveraging the cloud to 
host security tools that monitor for risk everywhere, from cloud 
to core.
Before we delve into the results of the survey question referenced 
above, let’s recap a few key statistics from last year’s “The Impact

of COVID\-19 on Enterprise IT Security Teams” survey report (see 
page 55\). Two findings are particularly noteworthy:
v Three in four (75\.1%) of the 600 IT security professionals who 
completed our survey last August indicated a significant or 
moderately increased preference for cloud\-based security 
solutions versus traditional on\-premises options.
v The top three IT security technologies that were specifically 
selected to address COVID\-19 pandemic challenges were 
cloud\-based SWG, cloud\-based NGFW, and cloud\-based SEG. 
Noticing a trend here? These days, smart IT security teams are 
turning to cloud\-based security solutions like never before. In our 
2020 CDR, respondents indicated that 35\.7% of their collective 
security applications and services were delivered via the cloud. 
This year, that figure has risen to 40\.6%, which equates to nearly a 
14% increase in just 12 months (see Figure 37\).
Section 4: Practices and Strategies
From a geographic perspective, the United States (47\.5%) has the 
highest adoption rate for cloud\-based security solutions, with 
Brazil (44\.4%), Saudi Arabia (42\.6%), and Australia (42\.4%) not far 
behind. Cloud\-based security solutions just aren’t as prevalent 
(yet) in Italy (27\.4%), Canada (33\.6%), and Japan (35\.6%) (see 
Figure 38\).
From an industry perspective, IT security professionals in 
the healthcare (42\.5%), manufacturing (41\.8%), and finance 
(41\.6%) industries certainly have their heads in the cloud. Their 
counterparts in the education (36\.7%) and government (37\.1%) 
industries, not as much (see Figure 39\).
Organization size doesn’t seem to be a significant factor, with the 
range varying from 500\-999 employees (45\.9%) to 10,000\-24,999 
employees (37\.4%).
Most agree that life may never return to exactly the way it was 
before the COVID\-19 pandemic began. Once the pandemic is 
over and we’re living in the “new normal,” many believe that 
organizations will begin to relax restrictions that previously 
prevented employees from working from home, now that 
they’ve seen first\-hand that remote workers can still be 
productive. This should entice organizations to invest even 
more in cloud\-based security solutions – a new normal for the 
security industry.
“These days, smart IT security team
 are turning to cloud\-based security solutions 
like never before.”

Benefits of Embracing DevSecOps Practices
Which of the following have been the biggest benefits of DevSecOps practices for your organization? 
(Select up to three.)
Figure 40: Most significant benefits of DevSecOps practices.
For those who aren’t familiar with DevSecOps, or simply haven’t 
jumped on the bandwagon yet, DevSecOps is a profound 
culture shift in the software industry that aims to bake security 
into the rapid\-release cycles. These are typical of modern (agile) 
application development and deployment, also known as 
DevOps. Instead of securing applications after coding is finished, 
organizations “shift left” by baking security into the application 
development process from the very beginning of the software 
development life cycle (SDLC).
We asked our 1,200 respondents about the most notable benefits 
of DevSecOps practices that they’ve seen in their respective 
organizations (see Figure 40\). Before we delve into the findings, 
it’s worth noting that the benefit at the bottom of the list 
achieved a 38\.3% rating. So, all five of these key benefits are 
compelling.
The top two items on the list of DevSecOps benefits are 
tightly coupled around the same topic–speed. Specifically, our 
respondents cited “increased speed of deploying application 
updates” (47\.2%) and “increased speed of deploying new 
applications” (45\.8%). Instead of tossing new applications and 
updates to existing applications over the wall to the security 
team to assess and approve, security is built and tested in during 
the development process, saving considerable time and, in many 
instances, accelerating business advantages.

If you’d like to know more about the tools that DevSecOps 
professionals use to embed security within modern applications, 
turn to page 40 to learn about SAST, DAST, IAST, and RASP
.
Third on the list of DevSecOps benefits is “improving relations 
between DevOps and SecOps personnel” (42\.9%). (We can 
visualize many of you shaking your heads as you read this.) 
Historically, tension has existed between DevOps teams and 
SecOps teams because they have widely divergent goals. One 
is focused on application features and functionality, while the 
other is focused on mitigating application cyber risks. This lack 
of cohesion between these two teams is detrimental to their IT 
organizations and the companies they serve.
To be clear, DevSecOps is a culture shift. Peter Drucker, widely 
regarded as the founder of modern management, once said, 
“Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” What he meant is that a 
company’s strategy, while by no means unimportant, takes 
a back seat to its culture. The same concept holds true 
within IT security teams. DevSecOps mandates continuous 
communication, transparency, and shared outcomes between 
DevOps and SecOps personnel. Suddenly, security is 
everyone’s responsibility!
“The top two items on the list of
DevSecOps benefits are tightly coupled
around the same topic–speed.”
This culture shift drives the next two beneficial outcomes on the 
list–reduced costs (38\.5%) and fewer application security risks 
(38\.3%). There’s no question that implementing DevSecOps has a 
positive impact on a company’s bottom line. Thus, DevSecOps is 
one of the fastest\-growing segments of the IT security industry. 
So much that we’re happy to report 93\.0% of our responding 
organizations have already begun to implement DevSecOps 
practices. Of the small group that hasn’t, 71\.4% plan to get 
started soon.

SSL/TLS Traffic Decryption Challenges
Which of the following challenges does your organization face with regard to decrypting SSL/TLS traffic and 
inspecting it for threats? (Select all that apply.)
Figure 41: Percentage of organizations facing SSL/TLS traffic 
inspection challenges.
WARNING: Please stand back as CyberEdge steps onto the 
proverbial soap box and preaches for a bit.
We all have pet peeves. Last year, SurveyMonkey surveyed 544 
ordinary people and asked them to rank their most significant 
pet peeves. The top three were leaving common spaces messy 
(63%), neglecting to take out the trash (45%), and talking loudly 
on the phone (30%). Well, we at CyberEdge have our own pet 
peeves about the security industry, and organizations failing 
to decrypt SSL/TLS traffic for inspection by security tools is one 
of them. It’s second on our list, if you must know, right behind 
security vendors saying “on premise” when they really mean “on 
premises.” But we’ll save that for another day.
Last year’s 2020 CDR provided an eye\-opening statistic on this 
topic. We asked our respondents to estimate the percentage of 
their organization’s SSL/TLS\-encrypted web traffic that is actually 
being decrypted for inspection by network security tools. The 
Section 4: Practices and Strategies
mean response was 34\.5%. That was shocking to us. With 85% 
or more (industry reports tend to vary between 85%\-95%) of 
web traffic encrypted, only decrypting a third of that traffic 
for inspection creates an enormous blind spot for security 
professionals.
So, this year we wanted to understand why more organizations 
aren’t decrypting web traffic for inspection. Specifically, we asked 
our respondents to select from four key SSL/TLS decryption 
challenges. But before we assess the rankings of those 
challenges, we’d like to point out a scary statistic from this year’s 
CDR. Exactly 88% of this year’s respondents indicated that their 
organizations are, indeed, experiencing challenges decrypting 
SSL/TLS web traffic (see Figure 41\). What’s frustrating is that we 
know it doesn’t have to be this way. (More on that later.)
The number\-one challenge our respondents face with regard 
to decrypting SSL/TLS web traffic is the significant decrease in 
performance within network security tools (44\.1%) (see Figure 
42\). We can remember when IPS, NGFW, and SWG vendors 
started to build SSL/TLS decryption into their respective products 
about 15 years ago. In some instances, performance decreased 
by 90%. These days, the performance hit on typical network 
security appliances is still significant.
“Exactly 88% of this year’s respondents 
indicated that their organizations are 
experiencing challenges decrypting SSL/TLS 
web traffic. What’s frustrating is that we know
it doesn’t have to be this way.”

Section 4: Practices and Strategies
The second\-biggest challenge pertaining to decrypting SSL/
TLS traffic is the potential for violating regulatory requirements, 
such as PCI DSS and HIPAA (42\.9%). If all network traffic is 
decrypted, outside attackers and unauthorized employees have 
more opportunities to read credit card numbers, medical data, 
and other information protected by regulations. To prevent this, 
solutions need “application intelligence” so they can decrypt 
selectively.
The third\-biggest challenge relates to the complexity of network 
architectures (41\.5%), followed by the fact that not all network 
security tools are even capable of SSL/TLS decryption (29\.0%).
Okay, so why is this subject such a pet peeve for CyberEdge? It’s 
because purpose\-built, dedicated SSL/TLS inspection appliances 
have been on the market for years and too few organizations are 
taking advantage of them. These appliances decrypt ingress and 
egress SSL/TLS traffic and direct it to a “closed loop” of network 
security tools (e.g., firewall, IPS, NGFW, SWG, DLP). After the traffic 
Figure 42: Challenges faced with decrypting SSL/TLS traffic for inspection.
has been inspected and malicious traffic has been blocked, 
the traffic is re\-encrypted before being forwarded to its final 
destination. Also, decryption can be selectively disabled for traffic 
that contains data protected by regulations.These SSL inspection 
appliances are so powerful that neither throughput nor latency 
of your Internet traffic is adversely impacted.
So, what does this mean for IT organizations? It means you 
can have your cake and eat it, too. By using dedicated SSL/TLS 
inspection appliances, you avoid performance impacts to your 
existing network security tools, you maintain compliance with 
regulatory standards, you maintain your network architecture, 
and you don’t have to worry about security tools that are 
incapable of decrypting web traffic. Given that the majority of 
modern malware uses encryption to conceal command and 
control (C\&C) communications, payload delivery, and data 
exfiltration, how can organizations afford to ignore this problem 
any longer?

Emerging IT Security Technologies
Describe your organization’s deployment plans for each of the following emerging IT security 
technologies / architectures.
Figure 43: Plans for implementing emerging IT security technologies / architectures.
To wrap up this year’s CDR findings, let’s assess the extent to 
which IT organizations are embracing three emerging security 
technologies: SD\-WAN, ZTNA, and SASE. For each technology, we 
asked our respondents whether it was already in production, if 
implementation was already in progress, if implementation was 
to begin soon, or if they had no plans at all for deployment.
Before we assess adoption rates, here’s a quick primer on each of 
these three emerging security technologies:
v Software\-defined networking (SD\-WAN) is the next 
generation of WANs and an important step in the evolution 
of networking. Instead of using dozens or hundreds of 
individually configured routers over expensive MPLS 
“If your organization hasn’t already
embraced any of these technologies,
we hope this year’s CDR will provide the 
evidence you need to influence change,
so your organization doesn’t end up at a 
competitive disadvantage.”

circuits, SD\-WAN simplifies network policy configuration 
and management while operating over broadband Internet 
connections, resulting in dramatically lower network costs.
v Zero trust network access (ZTNA) is a security framework that 
reduces network security risks by removing implicit trust and 
enforcing strict user and device authentication throughout 
the network. Unlike VPNs, which grant complete access to a 
LAN following user authentication, ZTNA denies access to all 
corporate resources with the exception of applications and 
systems to which the user has been explicitly granted access.
v Secure access service edge (SASE) is a cloud architecture that 
combines SD\-WAN with key network security functions, such 
as firewall as a service (FWaaS), secure web gateways (SWG), 
cloud access security brokers (CASB), isolation, and DLP
.
A common misconception is that organizations must choose 
between ZTNA and SASE approaches. This couldn’t be further 
from the truth. Each solution solves different challenges. And 
most importantly, ZTNA is an important ingredient of a compre­
hensive SASE architecture.
So, with our primer complete, let’s explore the results of the 
aforementioned survey question. And we’ll do so in two ways. 
First, Figure 43 illustrates current adoption, with percentages 
that depict organizations that have already deployed each 
technology or are in the process of deploying it now. Here we 
see that 82\.3% of organizations have already embraced SD\-WAN, 
which makes sense since it’s been around a few years longer. To 
a slightly lesser extent, 74\.5% of responding organizations have 
implemented ZTNA and 74\.1% have adopted SASE.
At the end of the day, all three of these emerging technologies 
play important roles in modern security architectures. If your 
organization hasn’t already embraced any of these technologies, 
we hope this year’s CDR will provide the evidence you need 
to influence change, so your organization doesn’t end up at a 
competitive disadvantage.

COVID\-19 Pandemic Impacts
The Impact of COVID\-19 on the IT 
Security Industry
The COVID\-19 pandemic and its shock to world economies 
have profoundly altered work environments and cybersecurity 
priorities. COVID\-19 has prompted a massive work\-from\-home 
(WFH) movement, leading to the skyrocketing use of videocon­
ferencing, collaboration tools, and cloud\-based applications. 
Networks and remote access infrastructure have come under 
pressure. New threats targeting these technologies and pandemic\-
related anxieties have emerged. Meanwhile, many IT security 
teams are forced to do more with the same or fewer resources.
How has the COVID\-19 pandemic specifically affected IT security 
organizations? How are they rethinking their priorities and 
investments? Well, thanks to research conducted by CyberEdge 
last year (and the generous support of our sponsors), we now 
have the answers.
In August 2020, CyberEdge surveyed 600 enterprise IT security 
professionals from seven countries and 19 industries. Our 20 
survey questions were related to the following four topics:
v 
IT security budgets and personnel
v 
Work\-from\-home movement
v 
IT security challenges
v 
Technology investments
This culminating report is titled, “The Impact of COVID\-19 on 
Enterprise IT Security Teams.” It contains dozens of helpful 
insights. Here are our top five takeaways:
1\. The 2020 budget shocker. Just when everyone thought 
that 2020 could finally be the year that IT security budgets 
stalled, we came along and are now dispelling that rumor. 
Our research indicates that the average enterprise IT 
security budget has received a 5% mid\-year “boost” during 
the pandemic to fund additional remote access capacity, 
to secure personally owned devices accessing company 
applications and data, and to pretty much buy anything and 
everything that begins with the word “cloud.”
2\. Remote workforce tidal wave. Prior to the COVID\-19 
pandemic, about 24% of an enterprise’s global workforce was 
working from home on a part\-time or full\-time basis. That 
number has risen to 50%, which equates to a 114% increase 
almost overnight. The implications of this so\-called WFH 
movement are profound and, we believe, will influence the 
“new normal” for enterprises moving forward.
3\. Spike in BYOD adoption. Before the pandemic, about 42% 
of enterprises employed bring\-your\-own\-device (BYOD) 
policies that enable employees to use their home computers, 
smartphones, and tablets to access company applications 
and data. That number has spiked to 66%, equating to a 59% 
increase in a matter of months. 
4\. Not enough aspirin for these headaches. Every IT security 
team in every enterprise is feeling the effects of this global 
pandemic, including dealing with an increased volume 
of cyberthreats (37%), insufficient remote access and 
VPN capacity (35%), and increased risks stemming from 
unmanaged devices (35%). 73% of our respondents are also 
experiencing increases in third\-party risks.
5\. A cloudy forecast. Three out of four (75%) IT security 
professionals now prefer cloud\-based security solutions to 
traditional on\-premises security solutions–and with good 
reason. This makes perfect sense as the top\-three IT security 
technology investments made specifically to address new 
challenges stemming from the COVID\-19 pandemic begin 
with the “c\-word.”

The Road Ahead
COVID\-19 Has Transformed the Workplace 
and Security Priorities
In most of our Cyberthreat Defense Reports, “The Road Ahead” 
section highlights the most critical emerging threats for the 
coming year–advanced malware, APTs, phishing, DDoS attacks, 
ransomware, etc.–and the latest security technologies being 
developed to meet them. 
In 2021, however, we are obliged to take a different approach 
and focus on how the COVID\-19 pandemic has created new 
security challenges by profoundly altering workplaces. The 
percentage of the global workforce working from home on a 
part\-time or full\-time basis has more than doubled, to roughly 
half of all workers. One direct effect has been a 59% surge in the 
number of enterprises implementing BYOD policies. Work from 
home and BYOD are likely to remain the new normal for most 
organizations. 
This transformation of the workplace has had a profound effect 
on the goals of security teams. Many of them now must protect 
far more remote and mobile workers than in the past, as well as 
their devices and the data on them. For once, emerging threats 
have been overshadowed by the imperative to upgrade the 
security of remote and mobile workers (while maintaining appli­
cation performance and controlling network and support costs).
Let’s look first at how this new imperative is likely to play out for 
security organizations and security vendors in 2021\.
Improving security and ease of use for remote workers: 
zero trust network access
Balancing security and ease of use for remote workers has always 
been a challenge for IT security organizations. But pre\-COVID, 
the limited number of remote and mobile workers meant that 
getting the balance right was just not a top priority. Today, with 
half of employees working remotely at least part\-time and BYOD 
part of the new normal, security organizations must focus on 
strengthening security for remote workers while making their 
lives easier (or at least not harder).
That’s why this year we are looking for a big push toward 
implementing zero trust network access. Zero trust technologies 
aim at enforcing user and device authentication consistently 
across remote and headquarters\-based workers, while tightly 
controlling access to applications and systems in data centers 
and cloud platforms on a “need to know” basis. Our survey data 
on page 53 shows very strong intent to implement and improve 
zero trust network access, and we expect this to continue to be 
a top priority for security organizations throughout 2021 and 
beyond.
Combining security and network management: SASE, 
SD\-WANs, NPBs, and more
The surge in remote work also has profound implications 
for the interaction between security and networking. In the 
past, enterprises could afford to backhaul all network traffic 
to corporate data centers for inspection and cleaning by 
on\-premises security tools. But with many more remote workers, 
far higher volumes of unpredictable network traffic, and more 
applications hosted in the cloud, that architecture becomes very 
problematic. When applications reside on cloud platforms:
v Backhauling large volumes of traffic via VPNs and MPLS 
circuits is expensive.
v Routing traffic through corporate data centers instead of 
directly to the cloud degrades application performance.
v It is much more difficult to take advantage of the new 
security tools designed to work on cloud platforms.
These factors are causing enterprises to examine how managing 
security and networks together can reduce costs, improve 
performance, and strengthen protection for remote workers. 
For example, SASE architectures, along with technologies such 
as SD\-WANs, network packet brokers (NPBs), and secure web 
gateways (SWGs) facilitate secure, direct\-to\-web connections 
for remote workers and branch offices, thereby reducing 
backhauling over VPNs and MPLS connections. They support 
capabilities like routing high\-priority applications over the

best\-performing network links and providing automatic failover 
when a link goes down. They also allow to traffic to be sent 
directly to cloud\-based security solutions that are integrated with 
cloud\-hosted applications.
These architectures and technologies were being implemented 
before COVID, but we believe the pandemic has greatly accel­
erated their adoption.
Security applications delivered via the cloud
As we related on page 47, over the past year the percentage of 
information security applications and services delivered via the 
cloud leapt almost 5%, from 35\.7% to 40\.6%. This transition has 
been going on for years but was accelerated by the pandemic. 
The higher the percentage of remote workers in an organization, 
the greater the incentive to connect them directly to cloud\-based 
security solutions rather than backhauling network traffic to data 
centers for inspection by on\-premises security products. We think 
that security organizations, and IT security vendors, will maintain 
a rapid march toward cloud\-based security in 2021 and beyond.
New Threats and New (and Improved) 
Technologies
Although the transformation of the workplace wrought by 
COVID\-19 has had the biggest impact on IT security directions, 
we should still note the influence of emerging threats and the 
new and improved technologies being developed to meet them.
Unified monitoring across platforms featuring 
machine learning
We have discussed for many years the disappearance of the 
hard perimeter for keeping threats out of the enterprise. Over 
time, the emphasis of security teams has evolved toward 
monitoring networks and systems to quickly detect and stop 
malicious activity. Now that task has become more challenging 
because your computing environment may now be spread 
across on\-premises data centers, SaaS applications, and cloud 
platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, 
and Google Cloud Platform. Detecting malicious activity requires 
monitoring and correlating tens of thousands of security events 
on all those platforms.
How are security vendors responding? First, by creating new 
monitoring tools or extending existing ones to capture security 
events and data across on\-premises, SaaS, and cloud platforms. 
Second, by embedding into their solutions improved ML tools 
that can sift through vast quantities of data to detect patterns 
correlated with attacks and emerging threats. The survey data 
on page 45 confirms the overwhelming preference of organi­
zations for security products that feature ML or AI. We think this 
preference will continue to feed an ever\-stronger trend toward 
greater use of ML and AI across more\-comprehensive security 
data sets.
It is your problem: third\-party risk management and brand 
protection
Traditionally, groups dedicated to third\-party risk management 
(if they existed at all) operated separately from IT security, often 
in purchasing or in governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) 
departments. In a similar way, brand protection programs, 
assigned to scan social media and ecommerce sites for scams 
and negative references that could damage an enterprise’s brand, 
often belonged solely to marketing.
But enterprises are worried that these siloed approaches increase 
risk. On page 13 you can see that of 11 security functions, 
respondents are least confident about the adequacy of their 
organization’s third\-party risk management (TPRM) capabilities. 
Brand protection is close behind as a major concern.
We believe forward\-thinking executives will increasingly realize 
that IT security organizations should share responsibility for 
third\-party risk management and brand protection. Security 
organizations at larger enterprises need to help their suppliers 
and other third parties find vulnerabilities and improve security 
processes. Likewise, the experience and skills of security groups 
are needed to help marketing groups detect brand\-related 
scams, fraud, counterfeit goods, and misleading information on 
websites and social media platforms.

This trend will offer new job options for IT security team 
members, and will also create new opportunities for GRC, 
threat intelligence, and brand protection vendors to tailor their 
solutions for a more diverse customer base.
More innovative technologies 
Here are some of the other innovative concepts and technologies 
we see becoming more prominent in 2021 and beyond:
v 
Security automation, orchestration, and response (SOAR) 
solutions will play an increasingly important role in managing 
and integrating security products on highly automated cloud 
platforms.
v 
DevSecOps concepts and products will help ensure that new 
applications are systematically tested for vulnerabilities and 
security policy violations.
v 
Browser isolation technology continues to improve and 
gain acceptance in large enterprise environments, and we see 
growing adoption ahead.
v 
Continuous security validation technology will help 
organizations confront evolving threats and changing attack 
surfaces. Instead of waiting for an attack to test security 
controls, this technology launches simulated attacks across 
an organization’s networks and systems, validating that 
controls are performing as expected in production, and 
facilitating incident response exercises and purple teaming 
(a technique where red and blue teams work together to 
challenge and remediate defenses).
v 
Threat intelligence platforms (TIPs) and services 
enable organizations to identify and prioritize indicators of 
compromise (IoCs) and other clues about ongoing attacks 
faster and more accurately. We are seeing improvements in 
these solutions that will widen their applicability, such as the 
ability to correlate open\-source threat data with events on an 
enterprise’s network and to initiate automatic scans based on 
new threat data. Page 41 shows that 43\.5% of organizations 
plan to implement a threat intelligence platform or service in 
2021, the highest “planned for acquisition” rate of any single 
technology in our survey.

Appendix 2: Research Methodology
CyberEdge developed a 27\-question, web\-based, vendor\-
agnostic survey instrument in partnership with our research 
sponsors. The survey was promoted via email to 1,200 IT security 
professionals in 17 countries and 19 industries in November 
2020\. The global survey margin of error for this research study 
(at a standard 95% confidence level) is 3%. All results pertaining 
to individual countries and industries should be viewed as 
anecdotal as their sample sizes are much smaller. CyberEdge 
recommends making actionable decisions based on global 
data only.
All respondents had to meet two filter criteria: (1\) they had to 
have an IT security role and (2\) they had to be employed by a 
commercial or government organization with a minimum of 500 
global employees. 
At CyberEdge, survey data quality is paramount. CyberEdge goes 
to extraordinary lengths to ensure its survey data is of the highest 
caliber by following these industry best practices:
v Ensuring that the “right” people are being surveyed by 
(politely) exiting respondents from the survey who don’t 
meet the respondent filter criteria of the survey (e.g., job role, 
job seniority, company size, industry)
v Ensuring that disqualified respondents (who do not meet 
respondent filter criteria) cannot restart the survey (from the 
same IP address) in an attempt to obtain the survey incentive
v Constructing survey questions in a way that eliminates survey 
bias and minimizes the potential for survey fatigue 
v Only accepting completed surveys after the respondent has 
provided answers to all of the survey questions
v Ensuring that respondents view the survey in their native 
language (e.g., English, German, French, Spanish, Japanese, 
Chinese)
v Randomizing survey responses, when possible, to prevent 
order bias
v Adding “Don’t know” (or comparable) responses, when 
possible, so respondents aren’t forced to guess at questions 
they don’t know the answer to
v Eliminating responses from “speeders” who complete the 
survey in a fraction of the median completion time
v Eliminating responses from “cheaters” who apply consistent 
patterns to their responses (e.g., A,A,A,A and A,B,C,D,A,B,C,D)
v Ensuring the online survey is fully tested and easy to use on 
computers, tablets, and smartphones
CyberEdge would like to thank our research sponsors for making 
this annual research study possible and for sharing their IT 
security knowledge and perspectives with us.
