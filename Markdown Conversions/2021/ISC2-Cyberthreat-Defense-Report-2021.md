## Introduction
CyberEdge’s annual Cyberthreat Defense Report (CDR) plays a unique role in the IT security industry. Other surveys do a great job of collecting statistics on cyberattacks and data breaches and exploring the techniques of cybercriminals and other bad actors. Our mission is to provide deep insight into the minds of IT security professionals. 
Now in its eighth year, the CDR has become a staple among IT security leaders and practitioners by helping them gauge their internal practices and security investments against those of their counterparts across multiple countries and industries. If you want to know what your peers in IT security are thinking and doing, this is the place to look. 
CyberEdge would like to thank our Silver, Gold, and Platinum research sponsors, whose continued support is essential to the success of this report.

### Top Five Insights for 2021
As always, our latest CDR installment yields dozens of actionable insights. But the following are the top five takeaways from this year’s report:
1. **Successful cyberattacks make the biggest jump in six years.** When CyberEdge launched the first CDR in 2014, 62% of organizations were compromised by successful cyberattacks. That number has risen to 86%. The percentage of organizations experiencing a successful attack rose 5.5% this year, the largest increase in six years. We believe this surge is due in large part to the dramatic rise in BYOD policy adoptions and a massive increase in third-party risks.
2. **Rewarding ransom payers is good for business (if you are a cybercriminal).** For the first time, more than two-thirds of organizations (69%) were victimized by ransomware. The percentage of ransom-paying organizations that recover their compromised data has increased steadily in recent years, from 49% in 2018 to 72% in 2021. Cybercriminals have learned that withholding data following payment receipt is bad for business. Unfortunately, this trend has enticed most victims to pay ransoms (57% in 2021), which in turn has funded more ransomware attacks, resulting in more organizations being compromised by ransomware than ever before.
3. **Adoption of cloud security solutions is rising.** The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked more interest in cloud-based IT security solutions than ever before. A year ago, 36% of security applications and services were delivered via the cloud. This year, that number has risen to 41%.
4. **IT security spending increases are slowing.** For the first time since we began tracking this statistic four years ago, the percentage of a typical IT budget spent on security has remained flat (at 13%) rather than rising. And for the first time in our eight-year CDR history, the percentage of organizations with rising security budgets has fallen (from 85% to 78%) and the average security budget increase has also declined (from +5% to +4%). So, overall IT security spending is still rising, but at a slower pace than usual.
5. **Pessimism is the new normal.** Eight years ago, 38% of CDR respondents felt that it was more likely than not that their company would be compromised by a successful cyberattack in the coming year. Sadly, eight years later, that number has doubled to 76%. IT security professionals are no longer just measured on their abilities to prevent cyberattacks from happening, but also their abilities to detect, terminate, and remediate from in-progress attacks.

## About This Report
The CDR is the most geographically comprehensive, vendor-agnostic study of IT security decision makers and practitioners. Rather than compiling cyberthreat statistics and assessing the damage caused by data breaches, the CDR surveys the perceptions of IT security professionals, gaining insights into how they see the world.
Specifically, the CDR examines:
- The frequency of successful cyberattacks in the prior year and optimism (or pessimism) about preventing further attacks in the coming year
- The perceived impact of cyberthreats and the challenges faced in mitigating their risks
- The adequacy of organizations’ security postures and their internal security practices
- The organizational factors that present the most significant barriers to establishing effective cyberthreat defenses
- The investments in security technologies already made and those planned for the coming year
- The health of IT security budgets and the portion of the overall IT budget they consume

By revealing these details, we help IT security decision makers and practitioners gain a better understanding of how their perceptions, concerns, priorities, and defenses stack up against those of their peers around the world. IT security teams can use the data, analyses, and findings to shape answers to many important questions, such as: 
- Where do we have gaps in our cyberthreat defenses relative to other organizations?
- Have we fallen behind in our defensive strategy to the point that our organization is now the “low-hanging fruit” (i.e., likely to be targeted more often due to its relative weaknesses)?
- Are we on track with our approach and progress in addressing traditional areas of concern, while also tackling the challenges of emerging threats?
- How does our level of spending on IT security compare to that of other organizations?
- Do other IT security practitioners think differently about cyberthreats and their defenses, and should we adjust our perspective and plans to account for these differences?

Another important objective of the CDR is to provide developers of IT security technologies and services with information they can use to better align their solutions with the concerns and requirements of potential customers. Our data can lead to better market traction and success for solution providers, along with better cyberthreat protection technologies for all the intrepid defenders out there.

The findings of the CDR are divided into four sections:

### Section 1: Current Security Posture
Our journey into the world of cyberthreat defenses begins with respondents’ assessments of the effectiveness of their organization’s investments and strategies relative to the prevailing threat landscape. They report on the frequency of successful cyberattacks, judge their organization’s security posture in specific IT domains and security functions, and provide details on the IT security skills shortage. The data will help readers begin to assess:
- Whether, to what extent, and how urgently changes are needed in their own organization
- Specific countermeasures they should add to supplement existing defenses

### Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns
In this section, our exploration of cyberthreat defenses shifts from establishing baseline security postures to determining the types of cyberthreats and obstacles to security that most concern today’s organizations. The survey respondents weigh in on the most alarming cyberthreats, barriers to establishing effective defenses, and high-profile issues such as ransomware and cloud security. These appraisals will help readers think about how their own organizations can best improve cyberthreat defenses going forward.

### Section 3: Current and Future Investments
Organizations can ill afford to stand still when it comes to maintaining effective cyberthreat defenses. IT security teams must keep pace with changes occurring in business, technology, and threat landscapes. This section of the survey provides data on the direction of IT security budgets, and on current and planned investments in network security, endpoint security, application and data security, security management and operations, and identity and access management. Readers will be able to compare their organization’s investment decisions against the broad sample and get a sense of what “hot” technologies their peers are deploying.

### Section 4: Practices and Strategies
Mitigating today’s cyberthreat risks takes more than investing in the right technologies. You must ensure those technologies are deployed optimally, configured correctly, and monitored adequately to give your organization a fighting chance to avoid being a front-page news story. In the final section of the survey our respondents provide information on how they are deploying and using leading-edge technologies and services such as security analytics and IT security delivered from the cloud. We also look at how IT security training and professional certification can help enterprises address the serious shortfall in skilled IT security staff.

## Research Highlights
### Current Security Posture
- **Most successful attacks in six years.** The percentage of organizations compromised by successful attacks rose by 5.5% – the largest annual increase in six years (page 7)!
- **Deepening pessimism.** For the first time, three-quarters (76%) of security professionals believe a successful attack is imminent – up from 38% seven years ago (page 9).
- **The weakest link: mobile devices.** Following a rise in WFH and BYOD policy adoptions, mobile devices are rated as most challenging to secure (page 11).
- **Shedding light on third-party risks.** A new entrant in this year’s CDR, third-party risk management (TPRM), is deemed the most challenging IT security function (page 13).
- **Feeling overwhelmed.** The vast majority (87%) of organizations are experiencing an IT security skills shortfall, and it has worsened during the pandemic (page 15).

### Perceptions and Concerns
- **Cyberthreat migraines.** Malware, ransomware, and spear phishing continue to cause the most headaches; zero-day attacks not as much (page 17).
- **Web and mobile attacks.** Nine out of 10 organizations (91%) have been affected by cyberattacks targeting web and mobile applications (page 19).
- **Fueling ransomware.** More than two-thirds of organizations (69%) were victimized by ransomware and most (57%) paid the ransom (page 21).
- **Security awareness gap.** For the second consecutive year, the number one barrier to IT security’s success is “low security awareness among employees” (page 24).
- **Unified app and data security.** “Simplified security monitoring” is the top benefit achieved by integrating application and data security to the same platform (page 26).
- **Cybersecurity career boosts.** Nearly all (99%) respondents agree that achieving a specialized cybersecurity certification would benefit their career (page 27).

### Current and Future Investments
- **Security spending plateau?** The percentage of a typical IT budget spent on security remained flat (12.7%) for the first time in three years (page 29).
- **Slowing security spending.** For the first time in CDR history, the percentage of organizations with rising security budgets has declined (from 85% to 78%) and the average security budget increase has declined (from +5% to +4%) (page 31).
- **Pandemic-fueled spending reprioritization.** The COVID-19 pandemic forced around seven out of eight (86%) organizations to reprioritize IT security spending (page 33).
- **Network security’s top picks.** NGFWs, DoS/DDoS prevention, and deception are the top network security technologies planned for acquisition in 2021 (page 35).
- **Endpoint security shopping list.** Deception and browser isolation are the endpoint security technologies most sought after this year (page 37).
- **The stars of app/data security.** API gateways and WAFs remain supreme, while bot management and FIM/FAM are on many shopping lists for 2021 (page 39).
- **TIPs tipping the scale again.** Threat intelligence platforms (TIPs) are atop the list of security management and operations technologies planned for acquisition (page 41).
- **Biometrics still red hot.** Biometrics tops the list of identity and access management (IAM) technologies planned for acquisition this year (page 43).
- **Demand for ML/AI holds strong.** Once again, 85% of respondents prefer security products that feature machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) (page 45).

### Practices and Strategies
- **Security is going cloud.** 41% of security applications are delivered via the cloud, up from 36% last year (page 47).
- **Reaping the benefits of DevSecOps.** More than nine out of 10 organizations (93%) are realizing the benefits of DevSecOps (page 49).
- **Decryption challenges.** Nearly nine in 10 organizations (88%) are facing challenges with decrypting SSL/TLS traffic for cyberthreat inspection (page 51).
- **Embracing emerging technologies.** Most organizations have embraced emerging security technologies: SD-WAN (82%), zero trust (75%), and SASE (74%) (page 53).

## Section 1: Current Security Posture
### Past Frequency of Successful Cyberattacks
How many times do you estimate that your organization’s global network has been compromised by a successful cyberattack within the past 12 months? 

The last year has been enormously challenging, both personally and professionally, on so many levels. When the world was turned upside down by the COVID-19 pandemic, cybercriminals exploited the situation in many ways. Phishing campaigns, deceptive domains, and malicious apps are just a few of the tactics these crooks employed to convert pain into profit.
In last year’s CDR, we saw a small uptick in successful cyberattacks as we crossed the 80% threshold for the first time in our report’s history. This year, we saw the largest annual increase in successful attacks within the last six years. Just over 86% of our responding organizations experienced at least one successful cyberattack within the preceding 12 months, with about four in 10 organizations experiencing six incidents or more (see Figures 1 and 2).
Of the seven major industries surveyed for this report, education was the hardest hit with 92.3% of organizations reporting a successful attack, followed by manufacturing (90.3%), telecom and technology (87.4%), and finance (85.5%). Next came healthcare (84.6%) and retail (81.7%). The bright spot this year was government, with only 72.5% of respondents experiencing a successful attack (see Figure 3). 
Geographically, Colombia claimed the top spot this year for the most organizations experiencing a successful attack (93.9%). Down the list, China (91.5%), Germany (91.5%), Mexico (90.6%), Spain (89.8%), and the United States (89.7%) were a bit above average. Countries that fared the best included the United Kingdom (71.1%), Japan (80.9%), Australia (81.6%), and Turkey (82.0%) (see Figure 4).

![Figure 3: Percentage compromised by at least one successful attack in the past 12 months, by industry.]
![Figure 4: Percentage compromised by at least one successful attack in the past 12 months, by country.]

Aside from COVID-19-specific threats, what other trends caused such a big jump in successful cyberattacks? We’re glad you asked. Last year, CyberEdge conducted a multi-sponsor research study titled, “The Impact of COVID-19 on Enterprise IT Security Teams” (see page 55 for more information). 
We surveyed 600 enterprise IT security professionals from seven major countries. Key revelations included:
- 114% increase in remote workers
- 59% increase in BYOD adoptions
- 73% observed increased third-party risks

With the majority of IT security organizations already understaffed before any of us knew what a coronavirus was, having to support so many additional remote workers, many of whom were (and perhaps still are) using unmanaged devices, caused organizations’ collective attack surfaces to increase exponentially almost overnight. Frankly, we’re fortunate that we didn’t see more than a 5.5% increase in victimized organizations. 
Our hats are off to all of you who worked so tirelessly to defend your company’s digital assets during such trying times! We dedicate this year’s CDR to you.

### Future Likelihood of Successful Cyberattacks
What is the likelihood that your organization’s network will be compromised by a successful cyberattack in 2021? 

In a 2019 study published by the National Academy of Sciences of the United States, Boston-area scientists found that the most optimistic people live an average of 11-15% longer than their more pessimistic peers. While most view optimism to be a healthy trait, we’re not so sure that mentality bodes well for cybersecurity professionals. And our CDR respondents certainly agree.
When we first asked the question at the top of this page for our 2014 CDR, only 38.1% felt like a successful cyberattack in the coming year was more likely than not. Fast forward to last November when our survey was live, and that number nearly doubled to 75.6% (see Figure 5). Now, considering that 86.2% of organizations were victimized by successful attacks last year, 75.6% actually reflects a degree of optimism that the coming 12 months will see an improvement. But over time, cybersecurity professionals have come to realize that it’s more of a question of when their organization will be victimized by a data breach than if. 
![Figure 5: Percentage indicating compromise is “more likely to occur than not” in the next 12 months.]
On an industry basis, the proportion of respondents saying a compromise was more likely to occur than not was highest in manufacturing (80.0%), retail (78.0%), and telecom and technology (75.6%). The most confident respondents (relatively) were in healthcare (63.8%) and government (70.9%) (see Figure 6). 
![Figure 6: Percentage indicating compromise is “more likely to occur than not” in the next 12 months, by industry.]
Of the 17 countries we surveyed, the majority of respondents in each one felt that a successful cyberattack on their employer was more likely than not. Respondents in China were the most pessimistic, and in fact the percentage there expecting a successful attack soared from 63.3% last year to 90.0% this year. Respondents in Australia and the United States also turned much more pessimistic, with those expecting successful attacks rising from 70.0% to 86.0% and from 71.6% to 82.1%, respectively. Respondents in Brazil (52.9%), South Africa (54.2%), and Italy (56.0%) were the least pessimistic. 
So, how can IT security organizations channel all of this pessimism toward a positive outcome? Well, you can start by planning for the worst while still hoping for the best. Specifically, smart IT security teams should:
- Invest in modern malware detection and cyberthreat hunting technologies that leverage machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)
- Select security analytics solutions that can quickly help you determine whether any data was compromised/leaked
- Adopt security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) technology that enables security teams to work more cohesively and accomplish more with fewer resources
- Pre-determine policies and procedures to accelerate recovery from ransomware and other attacks
- Invest in training and certification as tactics for both recruitment and retention to help close that IT security skills gap

Long gone are the days of evaluating cybersecurity professionals solely on their abilities to prevent data breaches from occurring. These days, IT security teams are evaluated on their abilities to rapidly detect, validate, investigate, terminate, and recover from cyberattacks. 

> “Over time, cybersecurity professionals have come to realize that it’s more of a question of when their organizations will be victimized by a data breach than if.”

### Security Posture by IT Domain
On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate your organization’s overall security posture (ability to defend against cyberthreats) for each of the following IT components:

![Figure 7: Perceived security posture by IT domain.]
The IT security component rated most challenging to secure this year is mobile devices (see Figure 7). That’s up from fourth last year. The reason for the jump? Two words: COVID and BYOD.
Last year, CyberEdge published a multi-sponsor survey report titled, “The Impact of COVID-19 on Enterprise IT Security Teams” (see page 55). Upon surveying 600 IT security professionals regarding how the pandemic has affected their practices and security investments, we learned that the number of organizations with bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies jumped nearly 60% due to the massive, almost-overnight increase in remote workers. These mobile devices were largely, if not almost entirely, unmanaged with few or no security protections. 
Next in line are Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which in the context of business equate to copiers, VoIP phones, building automation systems, closed-circuit TV (CCTV) systems, climate control systems, alarm systems, and more. Each of these IP-enabled components has an operating system, an application, and the potential for exploitable vulnerabilities.
The third type of IT component that causes the most security concerns includes industrial control systems (ICS) and SCADA devices. These devices are commonly used by manufacturers, electric power generators, nuclear power plants, chemical manufacturers, oil refineries, and water and wastewater treatment facilities. Just like IoT devices, each has an operating system and an application with potentially exploitable vulnerabilities. 
On a positive note, servers, websites and web applications, and datastores are of lesser concern, most likely because these are static assets that can be more easily monitored. Cloud applications used to be a significant headache for IT security teams. But with modern-day cloud access security broker (CASB) capabilities often baked into next-generation firewall (NGFW) and secure web gateway (SWG) solutions, the “shadow IT” phenomenon has declined significantly as an issue. 
So, in the grand scheme of things, how do this year’s overall security posture assessments compare to last year’s? Well, of the 13 IT components depicted in this survey question, confidence has declined in 12. 

> “The IT security component rated most challenging to secure this year is mobile devices. That’s up from fourth last year. The reason for the jump? Two words: COVID and BYOD.”

The only IT component that respondents are more bullish about defending this year is application containers, which rose to #9 on the list from #13 last year. Kudos to those innovative security vendors who’ve launched new solutions to safeguard Docker, Kubernetes, and other application container platforms. Our proverbial hats are off to you!
In case you’re wondering, IT components that reflect the greatest drop in safeguarding confidence are:
- Network perimeter / DMZ (public web servers) (-0.12)
- Mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) (-0.11)
- Internet of Things (IoT) (-0.08)

### Assessing IT Security Functions
On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate the adequacy of your organization’s capabilities in each of the following functional areas of IT security:

![Figure 8: Perceived adequacy of functional security capabilities.]
In this question, we presented a list of 11 IT security functions and asked respondents to rate the adequacy of their capabilities (see Figure 8). We added three new IT security functions to the list this year:
- Third-party risk management (TPRM)
- Brand protection
- Governance, risk and compliance (GRC)

We’d sure like to thank our sponsors that play in the TPRM space for encouraging us to add it to the list because, as it turns out, TPRM is the IT security function rated most challenging this year! And it makes sense, given several high-profile data breaches that have stemmed from victims’ partners, suppliers, and contractors. Companies that suffered breaches included Target (2013), Home Depot (2014), Capital One (2019), Quest Diagnostics (2019), Facebook (2019), Marriott (2020), and General Electric (2020). And let’s not forget about FireEye, Microsoft, VMware, and dozens of other companies affected by last year’s SolarWinds zero-day vulnerability.
Attack surface reduction – which includes vulnerability management, patch management, security configuration management, and penetration testing – was rated as the second-biggest challenge this year. In our humble opinions, too many organizations underinvest in this critically important area. If security teams were more efficient at finding and mitigating security risks, we wouldn’t need to rely as much on “next-gen” threat detection technologies because so many cyberthreats would be rendered harmless if the vulnerabilities they were designed to exploit were already patched.
The functional area with the greatest decline in confidence over the past year was incident investigation and response, which fell three places on our list. There are two reasons why we believe this is a direct result of the massive, almost-overnight increases in remote workers and BYOD policy adoptions (see page 55) stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. First, we already know that the sheer volume of cyberthreats increased last year, resulting in a record number of successful attacks. This equates to an increased volume of incidents to investigate and remediate. Second, it’s far more challenging to investigate employee-owned, unmanaged devices than company-owned laptops and smartphones.
Brand protection is a new entrant to our list this year and is also the newest IT security function to get on CISOs’ radar. In the context of cybersecurity, it relates to protecting intellectual property (IP) of companies and their associated brands against counterfeiting, copyright piracy, trademark squatting, patent theft, rogue websites, and social media impersonation. As this security capability is still emerging, it naturally ranks high on the list of most-challenging IT security functions. Thankfully, several security vendors have rolled out brand protection solutions that help track down and shut down fraudulent activities on the web.
From there, the next set of IT security functions are rated pretty close together. The security function that IT security organizations are most bullish about – despite being among the hardest to do well – is security engineering/architecture and design. Kudos to all of the security architects out there who are helping to make smart investments to keep their organizations safe (or as safe as they can be).

> “We’d sure like to thank our sponsors for encouraging us to add TPRM to the list, because it is the IT security function rated most challenging this year!”

### The IT Security Skills Shortage
Select the roles/areas for which your organization is currently experiencing a shortfall of skilled IT security personnel. (Select all that apply.) 

![Figure 9: Percent of organizations experiencing a shortfall of skilled IT security personnel.]
If there was ever a year when we needed plenty of skilled IT security personnel, it was 2020 – when the tidal wave of remote workers and new BYOD policy adoptions occurred. IT security teams had to immediately figure out how to more than double remote access capacity and secure unmanaged devices practically overnight.
Unfortunately, nearly nine in 10 organizations (87%) experienced a shortfall in IT security personnel last year (see Figure 9), which is a new CDR record and a 2.2% increase from the previous year. Two percentage points don’t seem like a lot, but overworked security professionals definitely felt the impact of being thrown into the fire to contend with the ripple effect of the pandemic (i.e., more unmanaged devices, larger attack surface, increased cyberthreats, and more incidents to investigate).
To add insult to injury, many organizations (especially in the travel, leisure, and hospitality industries) were forced to reduce workforce spending, including IT security staffing. As a result, many IT security teams had to contend with furloughs, reductions in hours, and layoffs.
If we break down the data by role, we see the greatest shortfalls in IT security are IT security administrators (40.4%), who are responsible for installing, configuring, monitoring, and maintaining IT security infrastructure components. Next are IT security analysts, operators, and incident responders (35.0%). These workers are on the front line of monitoring the organization for potential data breaches and other attacks. IT security architects and engineers were at the top of last year’s list of job shortages; however, this group has fallen to third position this year at 32.6% (see Figure 10).
Surprisingly, DevSecOps engineers (25.7%) are least in demand. It’s not because IT security organizations haven’t embraced DevSecOps, as this year’s CDR shows an impressive 93% of organizations have implemented, or are starting to implement, DevSecOps practices (see page 49). The most likely reason for this seeming contradiction is that many enterprises are training application developers and testers to integrate security into their jobs, rather than hiring people with DevSecOps titles.
Just like last year, IT security skill shortages are felt the hardest by organizations with 10,000 to 24,999 employees (91%). Organizations with only 1,000 to 4,999 employees (85.1%) are not as impacted but still are definitely feeling the pain like everyone else.
![Figure 10: Cybersecurity skills shortage, by role.]
> “Unfortunately, nearly nine in 10 organizations (87%) experienced a shortfall in IT security personnel last year, which is a new CDR record.”
With regard to major industries, telecom and technology (89.6%), retail (87.4%), and healthcare (87.3%) are the most affected by the shortage. Education (83.6%) and government (83.7%) are the least affected.
Around the world, we found the greatest shortages in Japan (whoa… 98.0%), Singapore (93.9%), and Canada (89.8%). IT security teams in Brazil (76.5%), China (80.0%), and the United Kingdom (81.4%) are faring a little better than the 87.0% global average.

## Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns
### Concern for Cyberthreats
On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate your overall concern for each of the following types of cyberthreats targeting your organization. 

![Figure 11: Relative concern for cyberthreats by type.]
Of the 12 classes of cyberthreats we track each year, concern for malware has been atop the list for six straight years (see Figure 11). According to the 2020 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), 17% of the data breaches researched for that report involved malware. So, it makes sense that malware, once again, achieved the highest 1-to-5 rating with a score of 4.04.
The next two classes of cyberthreats – ransomware (3.99) and phishing/spear-phishing attacks (3.99) – have appeared in the top three for the last four years. This year, they tied for second place, closely followed by account takeover/credential abuse attacks (3.98) and denial of service (DoS/DDoS) attacks (3.98), which tied for fourth place.
> “IT security professionals are more concerned about cyberthreats than ever before.”
The biggest gainer in this year’s CDR is advanced persistent threats (APTs)/targeted attacks (3.97), up 0.10 from last year. The next biggest gainer is web application attacks (3.94), up 0.09 from last year.
At the bottom of the list for the second straight year is zero-day attacks (3.86), as it should be, since less than 1% of registered vulnerabilities in MITRE’s CVE database originate as zero-day vulnerabilities in any given year. Plus, security vendors have made incredible strides over the years at detecting never-before-seen cyberthreats without the use of threat signatures. First, it was sandboxing and now it’s ML and AI algorithms to the rescue. 
As a reminder, respondents completed our survey in November 2020, about a month before the world learned of the infamous SolarWinds zero-day attacks that wreaked havoc on hundreds of commercial and government agencies around the globe. Next year’s CDR survey will be conducted in November 2021. It will be interesting to see whether concern for zero-day attacks lingers 11 months after the SolarWinds catastrophe.
One class of cyberthreat that we want to keep our eyes on in the years ahead is brand reputation attacks (3.87). We added this to the list last year and it remains in second-to-last position. But we believe that this low level of concern may be an “ignorance is bliss” phenomenon, as monitoring social media and the web for hijacked and/or impersonated social media accounts, counterfeit goods websites, and fraudulent websites will become more of a concern in the cybersecurity community as:
- Incidents become more frequent and serious
- Marketing discovers these concerns and asks IT for help
- Digital risk protection (DRP) and brand protection solutions become more prevalent

Finally, with all of the chaos that IT security professionals experienced last year stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic (see page 55), how has overall concern for all classes of
