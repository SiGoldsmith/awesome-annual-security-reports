# State of Cloud Native Application Security
How cloud native adoption transforms the way 
organizations defend against security threats

99% of companies recognized  
security as important to their  
cloud native strategy

## Success in the cloud native era
Success in the cloud native era is defined by an organization's 
ability to deliver new versions of software faster and more 
efficiently, which is reinforced by our survey results. Being able 
to deploy code to production faster and more easily manage 
those applications were the primary reasons for moving 
towards containerized infrastructure. However, as companies 
embrace cloud native technologies as part of their digital 
transformation, security is seen as a key factor to building 
successful platforms. While only 36% of respondents stated 
that security was one of the main reasons for moving their 
production applications into containers, 99% of respondents 
recognized security as an important element in their cloud 
native strategy. In addition, over 80% stated security is very 
important to them.

## What are the main reasons for moving your applications into containers?
![Chart showing reasons for moving to containers: Deployment velocity 68%, Ease of management 67%, Reduce costs 43%, Improved security 36%, Attracting talent 11%]
## How important is security to your cloud native strategy?
![Chart showing importance of security: Very important 83%, Somewhat important 16%, Not important 1%]

## As cloud native adoption increases, security needs to be built in as standard

## Over 78% of production workloads are deployed as containers or serverless applications
In total over 78% of production workloads are deployed as 
containers or serverless applications. Containers continue to 
be the dominant mechanism for cloud native application 
deployment, with nearly 60% of production workloads deployed 
in containers. Penetration of serverless technologies is now 
significant across all company sizes, and makes up more than 
a fifth (mean average) of all production workloads. Usage of 
cloud native technologies is strong  across all company sizes, 
indicating that adoption is becoming mainstream. With over 
50% of respondent’s workloads also being deployed with some 
form of Infrastructure As Code, use of software-driven 
infrastructure has increased alongside the container and 
serverless growth trends. Usage of these core technologies is 
one of the key indicators of cloud native transformation in 
general, and so we use these metrics throughout this report as 
indicative of the level of adoption within an organization.

![Chart showing production workload deployment: Containers 58%, Serverless 21%, IaC 51%]

## While 95% of respondents use automation, only 33% fully automate their deployment pipeline
Deployment automation is one of the key tenets of 
cloud native practices, enabling development 
velocity. Our survey showed that over 95% of 
respondents were using some level of automation 
with almost a third having an entirely automated 
deployment pipeline. By comparing the upper and 
lower quartiles of cloud native production usage 
(high levels of adoption vs low levels of adoption), 
we can see that organizations that show high levels 
of cloud native adoption are over twice as likely to 
have an entirely automated deployment process 
than organizations with low cloud native adoption.

## Misconfiguration and known unpatched vulnerabilities were responsible for the greatest number of security incidents in cloud native environments
In contrast to where organizations are most concerned, we also asked about 
previous incidents that occured in production. The top two incident types by a 
distance were misconfiguration and known unpatched vulnerabilities, at 45% and 
38% respectively. Over 56% experienced a misconfiguration or known unpatched 
vulnerability incident involving their cloud native applications.
Data leaks by insiders were more than twice as likely to have occurred in 
organizations with high levels of cloud native adoption, reinforcing that adopting 
zero trust principles becomes increasingly important in fully automated cloud 
based environments.

## Nearly 60% have increased security concerns since adopting cloud native
Adoption of cloud native technologies will 
undoubtedly change the security posture 
of your overall application. While the core 
security principles remain constant, as 
with all emerging ecosystems the best 
practice is still being defined, driving fresh 
concern as teams navigate through 
unfamiliar landscapes. Our survey shows 
organizations are nearly 4x more likely to 
have increased rather than decreased 
concerns over their security posture since 
adopting cloud native.

![Chart showing security concerns: Increased 58%, Decreased 15%, Hasn’t changed 20%, Don’t know 7%]

## Misconfiguration is the area of most concern when moving to cloud native
Cloud native platforms utilizing automated tooling will rely on credentials such as 
secrets and API tokens in order to operate, and necessitates a more decentralized 
approach to managing such access. The need for effective management of these 
kinds of artifacts is a key differentiator from the more centralized pre-cloud era, 
and a major area of concern for operations teams transforming their 
infrastructure. Our survey showed that misconfigurations were the biggest area of 
increased concern, with over half of respondents stating it’s a bigger problem for 
them since moving to a cloud native platform. Despite secret leaks and data leaks 
not showing up highly in the actual incidents data, they feature strongly as areas 
of increased worry particularly among high adopters of cloud native technologies.

## Deployment automation unlocks scalable security controls

## Highly automated pipelines are twice as likely to be incorporate security testing throughout their development lifecycle
While building fully automated deployment pipelines can be challenging, once automation and 
processes are in place, they can create a virtuous cycle providing multiple integration points to 
enable further automation This is a key enabler for security testing. Companies with high levels of 
deployment automation were more than twice as likely to have adopted security testing at all 
points throughout the software development lifecycle, when compared to organizations with no 
automation. While companies of all sizes showed a clear preference to test in CI and earlier, 
enterprises were more likely to also be testing during later deployment and production stages. 
Despite testing in local development environments, such as an IDE, being a developer driven task, 
more automated organizations were nearly twice as likely to see their development teams adopt 
security early on in their workflows.

## Continuous deployment empowers continuous testing
Snyk Report: State of Cloud Native Application Security | 09
Once the use of security tooling is integrated throughout 
the software development lifecycle, this dramatically 
expands the possibilities for more regular security testing. 
Nearly 70% of respondents with high levels of deployment 
automation were able to test their security daily or more 
frequently. This was 17x more than respondents who had 
no deployment automation, and 60% of those only tested 
their security monthly or less frequently. This was 3x more 
than respondents who had full deployment automation.

## Over 72% of fully automated teams find and fix critical vulnerabilities in under 1 week
Snyk Report: State of Cloud Native Application Security | 11
Testing faster leads to fixing faster. Over 72% of respondents with high levels of 
automation had an average time to fix vulnerabilities of less than one week, with 36% 
having an average of one day or less. Those with full automation were over 4x more 
likely to fix security issues in a day and over twice as likely to fix within a week. 
Automated testing is also a key enabler of visibility - you can’t fix what you can’t see. 
This was reinforced by the 28% of organizations with low levels of automation who 
responded that they didn’t know how long it takes them to fix issues.

## Companies who automate are twice as likely to implement security testing
Snyk Report: State of Cloud Native Application Security | 12
## Automation empowers shift left security
Adopting a broad and deep approach to security practices throughout the software development life cycle is key to a 
successful Cloud Native Application Security program. Our survey shows that companies with higher levels of cloud 
native automation have a greater adoption of security testing techniques. They tend to focus more on Static Application 
Security Testing (SAST), scanning for vulnerabilities in application dependencies with Software Composition Analysis 
(SCA), container image testing, and scanning infrastructure as code which are all techniques which fit well into the 
paradigm of automation. Organizations with fully automated deployment pipelines are twice as likely to adopt SAST and 
SCA tooling into their SDLC, and almost 3x as likely to add Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), although in 
general, dynamic testing isn’t as well adopted when compared with static testing. Policy compliance testing is still an 
emerging field, with only 23% of respondents having adopted it. 
Enterprises are more likely to adopt security practices, yet smaller 
companies with less established security practices are keeping up
Larger companies and enterprises are, of course, more likely to have the resources to run dedicated security teams 
so it shouldn’t come as a surprise to see enterprises having the support to adopt formal Cloud Native Application 
Security Practices. While in smaller organizations the security function may be wholly owned by another org, such 
as the engineering teams, our survey shows that they are still able to keep up, particularly in the static testing 
space with over half of small organizations adopting SAST, SCA and container image scanning.

## Developers are adding security to their stack of hats
The move towards the concept of DevSecOps has accelerated in conjunction with 
adoption of cloud native technologies, as security shifts left in the software 
development lifecycle. Developers now have a pivotal role in ensuring that cloud 
native applications and infrastructure are secure since they increasingly contribute 
to the application, the infrastructure code, and workload deployment technologies. 
With this in mind, perception of security ownership provided interesting results in 
our survey set. While less than 10% of respondents in security roles believed 
developers were responsible for the security of their cloud native environment and 
applications, over 36% of developers stated that they were responsible. 

Traditionally, in a more siloed organization, the ownership of security would have 
sat firmly with the security team. Respondents in security roles are almost 3x 
more likely to attribute security ownership to the IT security team than 
respondents in development teams are. These indicators suggest that this 
ownership is being accepted by the development teams faster than the security 
teams are willing to let go of it. Security teams are still adjusting to the shifting 
responsibilities which transitioning to cloud native brings, and development teams 
are increasingly aware of their growing role in Cloud Native Application Security.

## Developers and security both understand the importance of Cloud Native Application Security
The increased awareness of security in development teams was also reinforced by the survey results around security exposure 
concerns. Both developers and security professionals alike shared that switching to cloud native technologies had increased their 
security concerns. Developers were just as likely to be invested in good security outcomes as the security team - good news for the 
adoption of DevSecOps principles which relies on shared security goals across the organization.
