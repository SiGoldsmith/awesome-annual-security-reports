2021 NORTON CYBER SAFETY INSIGHTS REPORT 
GLOBAL RESULTS

PREPARED BY

Survey Method 

The research was conducted online by The Harris Poll on 
behalf of NortonLifeLock among 10,030 adults (aged 18\+) in 10 
countries. The survey was conducted February 15\-28, 2021 in 
Australia (n\=1,005\), France (n\=1,000\), Germany (n\=1,001\), 
India (n\=1,000\), Italy (n\=1,000\), Japan (n\=1,020\), Netherlands 
(n\=1,000\), New Zealand (n\=1,004\), the United Kingdom 
(n\=1,000\), and the United States (n\=1,000\). Data are weighted 
where necessary to bring them in line with their actual 
proportions in the population; India was weighted to the 
population of those who are online. Weighted variables varied 
by country and included one or more of the following: age, 
gender, race/ethnicity, region, education, marital status, internet 
usage, household size, household income, size of place, and 
propensity to be online. A global postweight was applied to 
ensure equal weight of each country in the global total. 

Population projection estimates cited are calculated based on 
adult population (age 18\+) figures from the U.S. Census 
Bureau’s 2021 International Data Base and Pew Research 
Center 2017 Global Attitudes Survey. No estimates of 
theoretical sampling error can be calculated.

Throughout the report, references to YOY changes represent 
differences in results from the 2019 Global NLCSIR Study, 
conducted online by the Harris Poll on behalf of NortonLifeLock 
among 10,063 adults (aged 18\+) in 10 countries from 
November 5 to December 2, 2019\.

CYBERCRIME: INCIDENCE, IMPACT, 
AND ATTITUDES

In a year filled with restrictions and lockdowns, cybercriminals were not deterred as nearly 
330 million adults in 10 countries\* experienced cybercrime in the past 12 months. Despite 
many consumers saying they are taking more precautions online because they are 
concerned about cybercrime, more than 2 in 5 feel more vulnerable to cybercrime than 
they did before the COVID\-19 pandemic, and half aren’t sure how to protect themselves.

ONLINE CREEPING

While over one\-third of adults\* who have been in a romantic relationship admit to online 
“stalking” their current or former partners, most consumers do not condone it. However, there 
are glaring differences in attitudes and awareness across countries between those under 40 
and those 40\+, with younger adults being much more likely to condone online stalking, to be 
aware of creepware, or to think their partner would be likely to plant it on their device.
