# Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021

With research conducted independently by the Ponemon Institute, this report – sponsored, analyzed, and published by IBM Security – studied 537 real breaches across 17 countries and regions and 17 different industries.

In the course of nearly 3,500 interviews, we asked dozens of questions to determine what organizations spent on activities for the discovery of and the immediate response to the data breach.

Other issues covered include:

1. Initial attack vectors that were primarily responsible for causing the breaches
2. The length of time it took the organizations to detect and contain their breaches
3. The effects of incident response and security artificial intelligence (AI) and automation on the average total cost

## Executive summary

Now in its 17th year, the Cost of a Data Breach Report has become one of the leading benchmark reports in the cybersecurity industry. This report offers IT, risk management and security leaders a lens into dozens of factors that can increase or help mitigate the rising cost of data breaches.

Each year, we aim to renew the report to offer analysis that builds upon past years’ research while breaking new ground to keep up with changing technology and events to form a more relevant picture of the risks and strategies for securing data and responding to a breach. The 2021 edition of this report has new analysis related to the advancement of the zero trust approach, risks that continue to make cloud security essential, and the acceleration of remote working as a result of the pandemic.

The report is divided into six major sections, including:

*   This executive summary with key findings and comments about how data breach costs were calculated
*   A deep dive into the report’s complete findings, with dozens of charts
*   An exploration of a methodology for risk quantification
*   Security recommendations that can help organizations mitigate the financial impacts of a breach
*   Notes on the geographic, industry and company size characteristics of the organizations studied
*   And a more detailed explanation of the study’s methodology and limitations

IBM Security and the Ponemon Institute are pleased to present the results of the 2021 Cost of a Data Breach Report.

Years in this report refer to the year the report was published, not necessarily the year the breach occurred. Breaches in the 2021 report took place between May 2020 and March 2021.

## Executive summary

### Key findings

*   **10%** Increase in average total cost of a breach, 2020-2021
*   **$1.07m** Cost difference where remote work was a factor in causing the breach
*   **11** Consecutive years healthcare had the highest industry cost of a breach

The average total cost of a data breach increased by nearly 10% year over year, the largest single year cost increase in the last seven years. Data breach costs rose from $3.86 million to $4.24 million, the highest average total cost in the history of this report. Costs were significantly lower for some of organizations with a more mature security posture, and higher for organizations that lagged in areas such as security AI and automation, zero trust and cloud security.

Note: Cost amounts in this report are measured in U.S. dollars.

Remote working and digital transformation due to the COVID-19 pandemic increased the average total cost of a data breach. The average cost was $1.07 million higher in breaches where remote work was a factor in causing the breach, compared to those where remote work was not a factor. The percentage of companies where remote work was a factor in the breach was 17.5%. Additionally, organizations that had more than 50% of their workforce working remotely took 58 days longer to identify and contain breaches than those with 50% or less working remotely. IT changes such as cloud migration and remote work increased costs, yet organizations that did not implement any digital transformation changes as a result of COVID-19 experienced $750,000 higher costs compared to the global average, a difference of 16.6%.

Healthcare organizations experienced the highest average cost of a data breach, for the eleventh year in a row. Healthcare data breach costs increased from an average total cost of $7.13 million in 2020 to $9.23 million in 2021, a 29.5% increase. Costs varied widely across industries, and year over year. Costs in the energy sector decreased from $6.39 million in 2020 to an average $4.65 million in 2021. Costs surged in the public sector, which saw a 78.7% increase in average total cost from $1.08 million to $1.93 million.

The key findings described here are based on IBM Security analysis of the research data compiled by the Ponemon Institute.

### Key findings

*   **38%** Lost business share of total breach costs
*   **$180** Per record cost of personally identifiable information
*   **20%** Share of breaches initially caused by compromised credentials

Lost business represented the largest share of breach costs, at an average total cost of $1.59M. Lost business represented 38% of the overall average and increased slightly from $1.52 million in the 2020 study. Lost business costs included increased customer turnover, lost revenue due to system downtime and the increasing cost of acquiring new business due to diminished reputation.

Customer personally identifiable information (PII) was the most common type of record lost, included in 44% of breaches. Customer PII was also the costliest record type, at $180 per lost or stolen record. The overall average cost per record in the 2021 study was $161, an increase from $146 per lost or stolen record in the 2020 report year.

Compromised credentials was the most common initial attack vector, responsible for 20% of breaches. Business email compromise (BEC) was responsible for only 4% of breaches, but had the highest average total cost of the 10 initial attack vectors in the study, at $5.01 million. The second costliest was phishing ($4.65 million), followed by malicious insiders ($4.61 million), social engineering ($4.47 million), and compromised credentials ($4.37 million).

### Key findings

*   **287** Average number of days to identify and contain a data breach
*   **100x** Cost multiplier of > 50 million records vs. average breach
*   **$1.76m** Cost difference in breaches where mature zero trust was deployed vs. no zero trust

The longer it took to identify and contain, the more costly the breach. Data breaches that took longer than 200 days to identify and contain cost on average $4.87 million, compared to $3.61 million for breaches that took less than 200 days. Overall, it took an average of 287 days to identify and contain a data breach, seven days longer than in the previous report. To put this in perspective, if a breach occurring on January 1 took 287 days to identify and contain, the breach wouldn’t be contained until October 14th. The average time to identify and contain varied widely depending on the type of data breach, attack vector, factors such as the use of security AI and automation, and cloud modernization stage.

Average cost of a mega breach was $401 million for breaches between 50 million and 65 million records, an increase from $392 million in 2020. In a small sample of mega breaches of 1 million to 65 million records, breaches were many times more expensive than the average cost of smaller breaches. Breaches of 50 million to 65 million records were nearly 100x more expensive than breaches of 1,000-100,000 records.

A zero trust approach helped reduce the average cost of a data breach. The average cost of a breach was $5.04 million for those without zero trust deployed. Yet in the mature stage of zero trust deployment, the average cost of a breach was $3.28 million, $1.76 million less than organizations without zero trust, representing a 2.3% difference.

### Key findings

*   **80%** Cost difference where security AI and automation was fully deployed vs. not deployed
*   **$3.61m** Average cost of a breach in hybrid cloud environments
*   **$2.30m** Cost difference for breaches with high vs. low level of compliance failures

Security AI and automation had the biggest positive cost impact. Organizations with fully deployed security AI and automation experienced breach costs of $2.90 million, compared to $6.71 million at organizations without security AI and automation. The difference of $3.81 million, or nearly 80%, represents the largest gap in the study when comparing breaches with vs. without a particular cost factor. The share of organizations with fully or partially deployed security AI and automation was 65% in 2021 vs. 59% in 2020, a 6 percentage point increase and continuing an upward trend. Security AI/automation was associated with a faster time to identify and contain the breach.

Hybrid cloud had the lowest average total cost of a data breach, compared to public, private and on premise cloud models. Data breaches in hybrid cloud environments cost an average of $3.61 million, $1.19 million less than public cloud breaches, or a difference of 28.3%. While companies that were in the midst of a large cloud migration experienced higher breach costs, those that were further along in their cloud modernization maturity were able to identify and contain breaches 77 days faster than those in the early stages of modernization.

System complexity and compliance failures were top factors amplifying data breach costs. Organizations with a high level of system complexity had an average cost of a breach $2.15 million higher than those who had low levels of complexity. The presence of a high level of compliance failures was associated with breach costs that were $2.30 million higher than breach costs at organizations without this factor present.

### Key findings

*   **$4.62m** Average total cost of a ransomware breach

Ransomware and destructive attacks were costlier than other types of breaches. Ransomware attacks cost an average of $4.62 million, more expensive than the average data breach ($4.24 million). These costs included escalation, notification, lost business and response costs, but did not include the cost of the ransom. Malicious attacks that destroyed data in destructive wiper-style attacks cost an average of $4.69 million. The percentage of companies where ransomware was a factor in the breach was 7.8%.

## Executive summary

### How we calculate the cost of a data breach

To calculate the average cost of a data breach, this research excludes very small and very large breaches. Data breaches examined in the 2021 study ranged in size between 2,000 and 101,000 compromised records. We use a separate analysis to examine the costs of very large “mega breaches,” which we explore in further detail in the complete findings section of the report.

This research uses an accounting method called activity-based costing, which identifies activities and assigns a cost according to actual use. Four process-related activities drive a range of expenditures associated with an organization’s data breach: detection and escalation, notification, post breach response and lost business.

For a more in-depth explanation of the methods used for this report, see the section on research methodology.

#### The four cost centers

*   **Detection and escalation**
    Activities that enable a company to reasonably detect the breach.
    *   Forensic and investigative activities
    *   Assessment and audit services
    *   Crisis management
    *   Communications to executives and boards
*   **Notification**
    Activities that enable the company to notify data subjects, data protection regulators and other third parties.
    *   Emails, letters, outbound calls or general notice to data subjects
    *   Determination of regulatory requirements
    *   Communication with regulators
    *   Engagement of outside experts
*   **Lost business**
    Activities that attempt to minimize the loss of customers, business disruption and revenue losses.
    *   Business disruption and revenue losses from system downtime
    *   Cost of lost customers and acquiring new customers
    *   Reputation losses and diminished goodwill
*   **Post breach response**
    Activities to help victims of a breach communicate with the company and redress activities to victims and regulators.
    *   Help desk and inbound communications
    *   Credit monitoring and identity protection services
    *   Issuing new accounts or credit cards
    *   Legal expenditures
    *   Product discounts
    *   Regulatory fine

### Global findings and highlights

The Cost of a Data Breach Report is a global report, combining results from 537 organizations across 17 countries and regions, and 17 industries to provide global averages. However, in some cases, the report breaks out the results by country/region or industry for comparative purposes. Although sample sizes in some countries/regions and industries are quite small, the organizations in the study have been selected in an attempt to be representative.

**Key finding**

*   **$4.24m** Global average total cost of a data breach

#### Average total cost of a data breach

*Measured in US$ millions*

**Figure 1**

*The average total cost of a data breach increased by the largest margin in seven years.*

Data breach costs increased significantly year-over year from the 2020 report to the 2021 report, increasing from $3.86 million in 2020 to $4.24 million in 2021. The increase of $0.38 million ($380,000) represents a 9.8% increase. This compares to a decrease of 1.5% from the 2019 to 2020 report year. The cost of a data breach has increase by 11.9% since 2015.

*   A line graph showing the average total cost of a data breach from 2015 to 2021. The cost is shown in millions of US dollars. The line starts at $3.79 in 2015, dips to $3.62 in 2017, then rises to $4.24 in 2021.

#### Average per record cost of a data breach

*Measured in US$*

**Figure 2**

*The average per record (per capita) cost of a data breach increased 10.3% from 2020 to 2021.*

In 2021 the per record cost of a breach was $161, compared to an average cost of $146 in 2020. This represents an increase of 14.2% since the 2017 report, when the average per record cost was $141.

\*It is not consistent with this research to use the per record cost to calculate the cost of single or multiple breaches above 100,000 records. For more information, see the research methodology section.

*   A line graph showing the average per record cost of a data breach from 2015 to 2021. The cost is shown in US dollars. The line starts at $154 in 2015, dips to $141 in 2017, then rises to $161 in 2021.

#### Average total cost of a data breach by country or region

*Measured in US$ millions*

**Figure 3**

The United States was the top country for average total cost of a data breach for the eleventh year in a row.

The top five countries and regions for average total cost of a data breach were:

1.  U.S.
2.  Middle East
3.  Canada
4.  Germany
5.  Japan

These same five countries comprised the top five countries in the 2020 report, in the same order. The average total cost in the U.S. increased from $8.64 million in 2020 to $9.05 million in 2021. The Middle East increased from $6.52 million to $6.93M and Canada increased from $4.50M in 2020 to $5.40 million in 2021.

Countries with the largest average total cost increase from 2020 to 2021 include Latin America (52.4% increase), South Africa (50% increase), Australia (30.2% increase), Canada (20% increase), the UK (19.7% increase), and France (14% increase). Only one country in the study saw a cost decrease, Brazil (3.6% decrease). One region, ASEAN, saw no change in average total cost ($2.71 million, no change in 2021).

*   A bar graph showing the average total cost of a data breach by country or region. The bars are grouped by 2020 and 2021. The US has the highest cost at $9.05 million in 2021. Other countries include Middle East, Canada, Germany, Japan, South Korea, United Kingdom, France, Italy, South Africa, Australia, ASEAN, Scandinavia, India, Turkey, Latin America, and Brazil.

#### Average total cost of a data breach by industry

*Measured in US$ millions*

**Figure 4**

Healthcare was the top industry in average total cost for the eleventh year in a row.

The top five industries for average total cost were:

1.  Healthcare
2.  Financial
3.  Pharmaceuticals
4.  Technology
5.  Energy

The average total cost for healthcare increased from $7.13 million in 2020 to $9.23 million in 2021, a 29.5% increase. Energy dropped from the second most costly industry to fifth place, decreasing in cost from $6.39 million in 2020 to $4.65 million in 2021 (27.2% decrease).

Other industries that saw large cost increases included services (7.8% increase), communications (20.3% increase), consumer (42.9% increase), retail (62.7% increase), media (92.1% increase), hospitality (76.2% increase), and public sector (78.7% increase).

*   A bar graph showing the average total cost of a data breach by industry. The bars are grouped by 2020 and 2021. Healthcare has the highest cost at $9.23 million in 2021. Other industries include Financial, Pharmaceuticals, Technology, Energy, Services, Industrial, Global average, Entertainment, Education, Transportation, Consumer, Communications, Research, Retail, Media, Hospitality, and Public sector.

*   **$1.24m** Detection and escalation
*   **$0.27m** Notification
*   **$1.14m** Post breach response
*   **$1.59m** Lost business cost

#### Average total cost of a data breach divided into four categories

*Measured in US$ millions*

**Figure 5**

*Lost business continued to represent the largest share of data breach costs for the seventh year in a row.*

Of the four cost categories, at an average total cost of $1.59 million, lost business accounted for 38% of the average total cost of a data breach. Lost business costs include: business disruption and revenue losses from system downtime, cost of lost customers and acquiring new customers, reputation losses and diminished goodwill. The second most costly was detection and escalation costs, which had an average total cost of $1.24 million, or 29% of the total cost. The other cost categories are notification and post data breach response.

*   A pie chart showing the average total cost of a data breach divided into four categories. The categories are Detection and escalation (29%), Notification (6%), Post breach response (27%), and Lost business cost (38%). The total cost is $4.24 million.

#### Types of records compromised

*Percentage of breaches involving data in each category*

**Figure 6**

*Customer personally identifiable information (PII) was the most common type of record lost or stolen.*

Customer PII was included in 44% of all breaches in the study. Anonymized customer data (i.e., data that is modified to remove PII) was compromised in 28% of the breaches studied, the second most common type of record compromised in breaches.

*   A bar graph showing the percentage of breaches involving different types of data. The categories are Customer PII (44%), Anonymized customer data (28%), Intellectual property (27%), Employee PII (26%), and Other sensitive data (12%).

#### Average cost per record by type of data compromised

*Measured in US$*

**Figure 7**

*Customer PII was the costliest type of record lost or stolen in breaches.*

Customer PII cost an average of $180 per lost or stolen record in 2021. In 2020, customer PII cost $150 per lost or stolen record, representing an increase of 20%.

*   A bar graph showing the average cost per record by type of data compromised. The categories are Customer PII ($180), Employee PII ($176), Intellectual property ($169), Other sensitive data ($165), Global per record cost ($161), and Anonymized customer data ($157).

### Initial attack vectors

This section looks at the prevalence and cost of initial attack vectors of data breaches. The breaches in the study are divided into 10 initial attack vectors, ranging from accidental data loss and cloud misconfiguration to phishing, insider threats, and lost or stolen (i.e., compromised) credentials.

**Key finding**

*   **$5.01m** Average total cost of a breach caused by business email compromise

#### Average total cost and frequency of data breaches by initial attack vector

*Measured in US$ millions*

**Figure 8**

*The most common initial attack vector in 2021 was compromised credentials, responsible for 20% of breaches.*

In 2021, the most frequent initial attack vectors were (1) compromised credentials, 20% of breaches (2) phishing, 17% (3) cloud misconfiguration, 15%. Business email compromise was responsible for only 4% of breaches but had the highest average total cost at $5.01 million. The second costliest initial attack vector was phishing ($4.65 million), followed by malicious insiders ($4.61 million), social engineering ($4.47 million), and compromised credentials ($4.37 million). The top four initial attack vectors were the same in 2021 as compared to the 2020 study, but slightly re-ordered. Phishing moved up from fourth to second most common, and cloud misconfiguration fell from second to third-most common. Vulnerabilities in third-party software (average cost of $4.33 million) fell from third to fourth in frequency, a category that was the initial attack vector in 14% of breaches in 2021, compared to about 16% of breaches in 2020.

*   A combined bar and line graph showing the average total cost and frequency of data breaches by initial attack vector. The bars show the average total cost in millions of US dollars, and the line shows the frequency as a percentage. The attack vectors are Business email compromise ($5.01 million, 4%), Phishing ($4.65 million, 17%), Malicious insider ($4.61 million, 11%), Social engineering ($4.47 million, 10%), Compromised credentials ($4.37 million, 20%), Vulnerability in third-party software ($4.33 million, 14%), System error ($4.11 million, 3%), Cloud misconfiguration ($3.86 million, 15%), Accidental data loss/lost device ($3.54 million, 11%), and Physical security compromise ($3.34 million, 5%).

### Lifecycle of a breach

The time elapsed between the first detection of the breach and its containment is referred to as the data breach lifecycle. The average time to identify describes the time it takes to detect that an incident has occurred. The time to contain refers to the time it takes for an organization to resolve a situation once it has been detected and ultimately restore service. These metrics can be used to determine the effectiveness of an organization’s incident response and containment processes.

**Key finding**

*   **$4.87m** Average cost of a breach with a lifecycle over 200 days

#### Average time to identify and contain a data breach

*Measured in days*

**Figure 9**

*The data breach lifecycle took a week longer in 2021 than in 2020.*

In 2021 it took an average of 212 days to identify a breach and an average 75 days to contain a breach, for a total lifecycle of 287 days. If a breach occurred on January 1st and it took 287 days to identify and contain, the breach would not be contained until October 14th.

*   A line graph showing the average time to identify and contain a data breach from 2015 to 2021. The time is measured in days. The graph shows three lines: Days to identify, Days to contain, and Total days. In 2021, the Days to identify is 212, Days to contain is 75, and Total days is 287.

#### Average time to identify and contain a breach by initial attack vector

*Measured in days*

**Figure 10**

On average, a breach caused by stolen credentials that occurred on January 1st would take until December 7 to be contained.

Breaches caused by stolen/compromised credentials took the longest number of days to identify (250) and contain (91) on average, for an average total of 341 days. Business email compromise had the second longest breach lifecycle at 317 days and malicious insider breaches took the third longest number of days to identify and contain at 306 days.

*   A bar graph showing the average time to identify and contain a breach by initial attack vector. The bars are grouped by Days to identify and Days to contain. The attack vectors are Compromised credentials (250 days to identify, 91 days to contain, 341 total days), Business email compromise (231, 86, 317), Malicious insider (223, 83, 306), Phishing (215, 78, 293), Social engineering (212, 80, 292), Global average (212, 75, 287), Physical security compromise (210, 76, 286), Vulnerability in third-party software (200, 71, 271), Accidental data loss/lost device (186, 65, 251), and Cloud misconfiguration (154, 69, 223).

#### Average total cost of a data breach based on average data breach lifecycle

*Measured in US$ millions*

**Figure 11**

*A data breach lifecycle of less than 200 days produced a cost savings of nearly a third over a breach lifecycle longer than 200 days.*

A breach with a lifecycle over 200 days cost an average of $4.87 million in 2021, vs. $3.61 million for a breach with a lifecycle of less than 200 days. The gap of $1.26 million represents a difference of 29.7%. This gap between breaches with a lifecycle shorter/longer than 200 days was $1.12 million in 2020. That means the beneficial cost impact of containment in less than 200 days grew from 2020 to 2021.

*   A line graph showing the average total cost of a data breach based on average data breach lifecycle. The cost is measured in US$ millions. The graph shows two lines: Lifecycle < 200 days and Lifecycle > 200 days. In 2021, the cost for Lifecycle < 200 days is $3.61 million, and the cost for Lifecycle > 200 days is $4.87 million.

#### Average total cost of a data breach with incident response (IR) team and IR plan testing

*Measured in US$ millions*

**Figure 12**

*Incident response teams and incident response plan testing continued to mitigate costs in 2021.*

The gap in average total cost between breaches at organizations with both IR teams and IR plan testing (IR capabilities), and organization with no IR team and no IR plan testing continued to grow. Breaches at organizations with IR capabilities cost an average of $3.25 million in 2021, compared to $3.32 million in 2020. The average total cost of a breach at organizations with no IR capabilities was $5.71 million in 2021, an increase from $5.09 million in 2020. The average total cost gap between IR capabilities vs. no IR capabilities was $2.46 million in 2021, representing a 54.9% difference.

The average cost difference between breaches at organizations with IR capabilities and organizations without IR capabilities was 42.1% in 2020. This indicates a growing cost difference effectiveness of IR capabilities from 2020 to 2021 (difference of $2.46 million in 2021 vs. $1.77 million in 2020). The average total cost of a breach at organizations with IR capabilities had a difference of 26.4% compared to the overall average total cost of $4.24 million in 2021.

*   A bar graph showing the average total cost of a data breach with incident response (IR) team and IR plan testing. The bars are grouped by 2019, 2020, and 2021. The categories are Formed IR team, IR plan testing, Both IR team and IR plan testing, and Neither IR team nor IR plan testing. In 2021, the cost for Both IR team and IR plan testing is $3.25 million, and the cost for Neither IR team nor IR plan testing is $5.71 million.

### Regulatory compliance failures

This year’s research study looked closely at the impacts of regulatory compliance failures. In this section, we first looked at the impact of compliance failures on the average total cost of a data breach. Out of a selection of 25 cost factors that either amplify or mitigate data breach costs, compliance failures was the top cost amplifying factor.

**Key finding**

*   **$5.65m** Average cost of a breach at organizations with high level compliance failures

We then looked at the difference in “longtail costs” in breaches at organizations in highly regulated industries versus those in industries with less stringent data protection regulations. We defined highly regulated industries to include energy, healthcare, consumer goods, financial, technology, pharmaceuticals, communication, public sector and education. Organizations in retail, industrial, entertainment, media, research services, and hospitality were considered to be in a low regulatory environment. In the analysis of industries in the high versus low regulation categories, we concluded that regulatory and legal costs may have contributed to higher costs in the years following a breach.

#### Impact of compliance failures on the average cost of a data breach

*Measured in US$ millions*

**Figure 13**

*Compliance failures was the top factor found to amplify data breach costs.*

Organizations with a high level of compliance failures (resulting in fines, penalties and lawsuits) experienced an average cost of a data breach of $5.65 million, compared to $3.35 million at organizations with low levels of compliance failures, a difference of $2.3 million or 51.1%.

*   A bar graph showing the impact of compliance failures on the average cost of a data breach. The cost is measured in US$ millions. The categories are High level compliance failures ($5.65 million) and Low level compliance failures ($3.35 million).

#### Average distribution of data breach costs over time in low vs. high regulatory environments

*Percentage of total costs accrued in three month intervals*

**Figure 14**

*Breaches in stricter regulatory environments tended to see more costs accrue in later years following the breach.*

The difference between high regulatory environments and low regulatory environments was most pronounced in breach costs incurred more than two years after the breach. In highly regulated industries, 20% of costs were incurred after two years, vs. 11% of costs in less regulated industries. Overall averages found that 16% of breach costs were incurred after two years. In less regulated industries, 68% of costs were incurred in the first 12 months, vs. 46% of costs in highly regulated industries. Note: This research examined a sample of breaches over two-plus years – 83 breaches in a high regulatory environment and 101 in a low regulatory environment.

*   A stacked bar graph showing the average distribution of data breach costs over time in low vs. high regulatory environments. The bars are grouped by time elapsed (0-3 months, 3-6 months, 6-9 months, 9-12 months, 12-15 months, 15-18 months, 18-21 months, 21-24 months, and > 2 years). The graph shows three lines: 2021 average, Low regulation, and High regulation. The percentage of total cost is shown for each time interval.

### Impact of zero trust

For the first year, this study examined the prevalence and impact of a zero trust security architecture. This approach operates on the assumption that user identities or the network itself may already be compromised, and instead relies on AI and analytics to continuously validate connections between users, data and resources.

**Key finding**

*   **$5.04m** Average cost of a breach at organizations without zero trust deployed

#### Has your organization deployed zero trust?

**Figure 15**

*Only about a third of organizations have a zero trust approach.*

While 65% of respondents do not have zero trust deployed, 35% have a partially or fully deployed zero trust approach.

*   A pie chart showing the percentage of organizations that have deployed zero trust. The chart shows two categories: Fully or partially deployed (35%) and Not deployed (65%).

#### State of zero trust deployment

*Percentage of organizations per deployment category*

**Figure 16**

*Close to half of organizations have no plans in place to deploy zero trust.*

Just 20% are fully deployed and 15% are partially deployed. While 22% say they plan to deploy zero trust in the next 12 months, 43% say they have no current plans to deploy zero trust.

*   A bar graph showing the state of zero trust deployment. The categories are No plans to deploy (43%), Deployment within 12 months (22%), Partially deployed (15%), and Fully deployed (20%).

#### Zero trust maturity level

*Percentage of organizations per maturity stage*

**Figure 17**

Those who have deployed zero trust tend to be in the middle or mature stages of deployment.

Of respondents that have fully or partially or fully deployed zero trust, 14% are in early stage deployment, 38% middle stage and 48% mature stage. This means just 16.8% of organizations in the study have a mature stage zero trust approach (i.e., 4
