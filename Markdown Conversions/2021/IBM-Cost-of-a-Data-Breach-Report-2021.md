Cost of a 
Data Breach
Report  
2021 
With research conducted independently by the Ponemon 
Institute, this report – sponsored, analyzed, and published 
by IBM Security – studied 537 real breaches across 17 
countries and regions and 17 different industries.
In the course of nearly 3,500 interviews, we asked dozens 
of questions to determine what organizations spent on 
activities for the discovery of and the immediate response  
to the data breach.
Other issues covered include:
1

Each year, we aim to renew the report to offer analysis  
that builds upon past years’ research while breaking new 
ground to keep up with changing technology and events to 
form a more relevant picture of the risks and strategies for 
securing data and responding to a breach. The 2021 edition  
of this report has new analysis related to the advancement 
of the zero trust approach, risks that continue to make cloud 
security essential, and the acceleration of remote working  
as a result of the pandemic.
The report is divided into six major sections, including:

Increase in average 
total cost of a breach, 
2020-2021 
Cost difference where 
remote work was a factor  
in causing the breach 
Consecutive years 
healthcare had the highest 
industry cost of a breach 
The average total cost of a data breach increased  
by nearly 10% year over year, the largest  
single year cost increase in the last seven years. 
Data breach costs rose from $3.86 million to $4.24 million, 
the highest average total cost in the history of this report. 
Costs were significantly lower for some of organizations 
with a more mature security posture, and higher for 
organizations that lagged in areas such as security  
AI and automation, zero trust and cloud security. 
 
Note: Cost amounts in this report are measured in U.S. dollars. 
Remote working and digital transformation 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic increased  
the average total cost of a data breach. 
The average cost was $1.07 million higher in breaches 
where remote work was a factor in causing the breach, 
compared to those where remote work was not a factor. 
The percentage of companies where remote work was a 
factor in the breach was 17.5%. Additionally, organizations 
that had more than 50% of their workforce working 
remotely took 58 days longer to identify and contain 
breaches than those with 50% or less working remotely. 
IT changes such as cloud migration and remote work 
increased costs, yet organizations that did not implement 
any digital transformation changes as a result of COVID-19 
experienced $750,000 higher costs compared to the  
global average, a difference of 16.6%. 
Healthcare organizations experienced the 
highest average cost of a data breach,  
for the eleventh year in a row. 
Healthcare data breach costs increased from an average 
total cost of $7.13 million in 2020 to $9.23 million in  
2021, a 29.5% increase. Costs varied widely across 
industries, and year over year. Costs in the energy sector 
decreased from $6.39 million in 2020 to an average  
$4.65 million in 2021. Costs surged in the public sector, 
which saw a 78.7% increase in average total cost from 
$1.08 million to $1.93 million.

Lost business  
share of total  
breach costs 
Per record cost of 
personally identifiable 
information 
Share of breaches  
initially caused by 
compromised credentials 
Lost business represented the  
largest share of breach costs,  
at an average total cost of $1.59M.
Lost business represented 38% of the overall average  
and increased slightly from $1.52 million in the 2020  
study. Lost business costs included increased customer 
turnover, lost revenue due to system downtime and the 
increasing cost of acquiring new business due to  
diminished reputation.  
 
Customer personally identifiable  
information (PII) was the most common  
type of record lost, included in 44% of breaches. 
Customer PII was also the costliest record type,  
at $180 per lost or stolen record. The overall  
average cost per record in the 2021 study was $161,  
an increase from $146 per lost or stolen record in  
the 2020 report year. 
Compromised credentials was the  
most common initial attack vector,  
responsible for 20% of breaches. 
Business email compromise (BEC) was responsible  
for only 4% of breaches, but had the highest average  
total cost of the 10 initial attack vectors in the study,  
at $5.01 million. The second costliest was phishing  
($4.65 million), followed by malicious insiders  
($4.61 million), social engineering ($4.47 million),  
and compromised credentials ($4.37 million).

Average number of days 
to identify and contain a 
data breach 
Cost multiplier of  
> 50 million records  
vs. average breach 
Cost difference in breaches 
where mature zero trust was 
deployed vs. no zero trust 
The longer it took to identify  
and contain, the more costly  
the breach. 
Data breaches that took longer than 200 days to identify 
and contain cost on average $4.87 million, compared 
to $3.61 million for breaches that took less than 200 
days. Overall, it took an average of 287 days to identify 
and contain a data breach, seven days longer than in the 
previous report. To put this in perspective, if a breach 
occurring on January 1 took 287 days to identify and 
contain, the breach wouldn’t be contained until October 
14th. The average time to identify and contain varied  
widely depending on the type of data breach, attack vector, 
factors such as the use of security AI and automation,  
and cloud modernization stage. 
Average cost of a mega breach was $401 million  
for breaches between 50 million and 65 million  
records, an increase from $392 million in 2020. 
In a small sample of mega breaches of 1 million  
to 65 million records, breaches were many times  
more expensive than the average cost of smaller  
breaches. Breaches of 50 million to 65 million records  
were nearly 100x more expensive than breaches  
of 1,000-100,000 records. 
A zero trust approach  
helped reduce the average  
cost of a data breach. 
The average cost of a breach was $5.04 million for  
those without zero trust deployed. Yet in the mature  
stage of zero trust deployment, the average cost of a  
breach was $3.28 million, $1.76 million less than 
organizations without zero trust, representing a  
2.3% difference.

Average cost of a 
breach in hybrid cloud 
environments 
Cost difference for breaches 
with high vs. low level of 
compliance failures 
Security AI and automation 
had the biggest positive  
cost impact. 
Organizations with fully deployed security AI and 
automation experienced breach costs of $2.90 million, 
compared to $6.71 million at organizations without  
security AI and automation. The difference of  
$3.81 million, or nearly 80%, represents the largest 
gap in the study when comparing breaches with  
vs. without a particular cost factor. The share of  
organizations with fully or partially deployed security  
AI and automation was 65% in 2021 vs. 59% in 2020,  
a 6 percentage point increase and continuing an upward 
trend. Security AI/automation was associated with a  
faster time to identify and contain the breach. 
Hybrid cloud had the lowest average total cost  
of a data breach, compared to public, private  
and on premise cloud models. 
Data breaches in hybrid cloud environments cost  
an average of $3.61 million, $1.19 million less than  
public cloud breaches, or a difference of 28.3%.  
While companies that were in the midst of a large cloud 
migration experienced higher breach costs, those that were 
further along in their cloud modernization maturity were 
able to identify and contain breaches 77 days faster than 
those in the early stages of modernization.
System complexity and compliance  
failures were top factors amplifying  
data breach costs.
Organizations with a high level of system complexity had 
an average cost of a breach $2.15 million higher than those 
who had low levels of complexity. The presence of a high 
level of compliance failures was associated with breach 
costs that were $2.30 million higher than breach costs  
at organizations without this factor present.

Average  
total cost of a  
ransomware breach 
Ransomware and destructive  
attacks were costlier than  
other types of breaches. 
Ransomware attacks cost an average of $4.62 
million, more expensive than the average data breach 
($4.24 million). These costs included escalation, 
notification, lost business and response costs, but did 
not include the cost of the ransom. Malicious attacks 
that destroyed data in destructive wiper-style attacks 
cost an average of $4.69 million. The percentage of 
companies where ransomware was a factor in the 
breach was 7.8%.

Executive summary
How we calculate the  
cost of a data breach
To calculate the average cost of a data breach, this 
research excludes very small and very large breaches. 
Data breaches examined in the 2021 study ranged in size 
between 2,000 and 101,000 compromised records. We 
use a separate analysis to examine the costs of very large 
“mega breaches,” which we explore in further detail in the 
complete findings section of the report. 
 
This research uses an accounting method called  
activity-based costing, which identifies activities and 
assigns a cost according to actual use. Four process-related 
activities drive a range of expenditures associated with 
an organization’s data breach: detection and escalation, 
notification, post breach response and lost business.  
 
For a more in-depth explanation of the methods used for 
this report, see the section on research methodology.

Customer personally identifiable information (PII)  
was the most common type of record lost or stolen.
Customer PII was included in 44% of all breaches in 
the study. Anonymized customer data (i.e., data that is 
modified to remove PII) was compromised in 28% of the 
breaches studied, the second most common type of record 
compromised in breaches.

Initial attack vectors
This section looks at the prevalence and cost of initial attack vectors of data 
breaches. The breaches in the study are divided into 10 initial attack vectors, 
ranging from accidental data loss and cloud misconfiguration to phishing,  
insider threats, and lost or stolen (i.e., compromised) credentials.
