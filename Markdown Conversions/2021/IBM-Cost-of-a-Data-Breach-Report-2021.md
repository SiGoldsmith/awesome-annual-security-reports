Cost of a 
Data Breach
Report 
2021 
With research conducted independently by the Ponemon 
Institute, this report – sponsored, analyzed, and published 
by IBM Security – studied 537 real breaches across 17 
countries and regions and 17 different industries.
In the course of nearly 3,500 interviews, we asked dozens 
of questions to determine what organizations spent on 
activities for the discovery of and the immediate response 
to the data breach.
Other issues covered include:

Each year, we aim to renew the report to offer analysis 
that builds upon past years’ research while breaking new 
ground to keep up with changing technology and events to 
form a more relevant picture of the risks and strategies for 
securing data and responding to a breach. The 2021 edition 
of this report has new analysis related to the advancement 
of the zero trust approach, risks that continue to make cloud 
security essential, and the acceleration of remote working 
as a result of the pandemic.
The report is divided into six major sections, including:

Increase in average 
total cost of a breach, 
2020\-2021 
Cost difference where 
remote work was a factor 
in causing the breach 
Consecutive years 
healthcare had the highest 
industry cost of a breach 
The average total cost of a data breach increased 
by nearly 10% year over year, the largest 
single year cost increase in the last seven years. 
Data breach costs rose from $3\.86 million to $4\.24 million, 
the highest average total cost in the history of this report. 
Costs were significantly lower for some of organizations 
with a more mature security posture, and higher for 
organizations that lagged in areas such as security 
AI and automation, zero trust and cloud security. 
 
Note: Cost amounts in this report are measured in U.S. dollars. 
Remote working and digital transformation 
due to the COVID\-19 pandemic increased 
the average total cost of a data breach. 
The average cost was $1\.07 million higher in breaches 
where remote work was a factor in causing the breach, 
compared to those where remote work was not a factor. 
The percentage of companies where remote work was a 
factor in the breach was 17\.5%. Additionally, organizations 
that had more than 50% of their workforce working 
remotely took 58 days longer to identify and contain 
breaches than those with 50% or less working remotely. 
IT changes such as cloud migration and remote work 
increased costs, yet organizations that did not implement 
any digital transformation changes as a result of COVID\-19 
experienced $750,000 higher costs compared to the 
global average, a difference of 16\.6%. 
Healthcare organizations experienced the 
highest average cost of a data breach, 
for the eleventh year in a row. 
Healthcare data breach costs increased from an average 
total cost of $7\.13 million in 2020 to $9\.23 million in 
2021, a 29\.5% increase. Costs varied widely across 
industries, and year over year. Costs in the energy sector 
decreased from $6\.39 million in 2020 to an average 
$4\.65 million in 2021\. Costs surged in the public sector, 
which saw a 78\.7% increase in average total cost from 
$1\.08 million to $1\.93 million.

Lost business represented the 
largest share of breach costs, 
at an average total cost of $1\.59M.
Lost business represented 38% of the overall average 
and increased slightly from $1\.52 million in the 2020 
study. Lost business costs included increased customer 
turnover, lost revenue due to system downtime and the 
increasing cost of acquiring new business due to 
diminished reputation. 
 
Customer personally identifiable 
information (PII) was the most common 
type of record lost, included in 44% of breaches. 
Customer PII was also the costliest record type, 
at $180 per lost or stolen record. The overall 
average cost per record in the 2021 study was $161, 
an increase from $146 per lost or stolen record in 
the 2020 report year. 
Compromised credentials was the 
most common initial attack vector, 
responsible for 20% of breaches. 
Business email compromise (BEC) was responsible 
for only 4% of breaches, but had the highest average 
total cost of the 10 initial attack vectors in the study, 
at $5\.01 million. The second costliest was phishing 
($4\.65 million), followed by malicious insiders 
($4\.61 million), social engineering ($4\.47 million), 
and compromised credentials ($4\.37 million).

Cost multiplier of 
\> 50 million records 
vs. average breach 
Cost difference in breaches 
where mature zero trust was 
deployed vs. no zero trust 
The longer it took to identify 
and contain, the more costly 
the breach. 
Data breaches that took longer than 200 days to identify 
and contain cost on average $4\.87 million, compared 
to $3\.61 million for breaches that took less than 200 
days. Overall, it took an average of 287 days to identify 
and contain a data breach, seven days longer than in the 
previous report. To put this in perspective, if a breach 
occurring on January 1 took 287 days to identify and 
contain, the breach wouldn’t be contained until October 
14th. The average time to identify and contain varied 
widely depending on the type of data breach, attack vector, 
factors such as the use of security AI and automation, 
and cloud modernization stage. 
Average cost of a mega breach was $401 million 
for breaches between 50 million and 65 million 
records, an increase from $392 million in 2020\. 
In a small sample of mega breaches of 1 million 
to 65 million records, breaches were many times 
more expensive than the average cost of smaller 
breaches. Breaches of 50 million to 65 million records 
were nearly 100x more expensive than breaches 
of 1,000\-100,000 records. 
A zero trust approach 
helped reduce the average 
cost of a data breach. 
The average cost of a breach was $5\.04 million for 
those without zero trust deployed. Yet in the mature 
stage of zero trust deployment, the average cost of a 
breach was $3\.28 million, $1\.76 million less than 
organizations without zero trust, representing a 
2\.3% difference.

environments 
Cost difference for breaches 
with high vs. low level of

Security AI and automation 
had the biggest positive 
cost impact. 
Organizations with fully deployed security AI and 
automation experienced breach costs of $2\.90 million, 
compared to $6\.71 million at organizations without 
security AI and automation. The difference of 
$3\.81 million, or nearly 80%, represents the largest 
gap in the study when comparing breaches with 
vs. without a particular cost factor. The share of 
organizations with fully or partially deployed security 
AI and automation was 65% in 2021 vs. 59% in 2020, 
a 6 percentage point increase and continuing an upward 
trend. Security AI/automation was associated with a 
faster time to identify and contain the breach. 
Hybrid cloud had the lowest average total cost 
of a data breach, compared to public, private 
and on premise cloud models. 
Data breaches in hybrid cloud environments cost 
an average of $3\.61 million, $1\.19 million less than 
public cloud breaches, or a difference of 28\.3%. 
While companies that were in the midst of a large cloud 
migration experienced higher breach costs, those that were 
further along in their cloud modernization maturity were 
able to identify and contain breaches 77 days faster than 
those in the early stages of modernization.
System complexity and compliance 
failures were top factors amplifying 
data breach costs.
Organizations with a high level of system complexity had 
an average cost of a breach $2\.15 million higher than those 
who had low levels of complexity. The presence of a high 
level of compliance failures was associated with breach 
costs that were $2\.30 million higher than breach costs 
at organizations without this factor present.

($4\.24 million). These costs included escalation, 
notification, lost business and response costs, but did 
not include the cost of the ransom. Malicious attacks 
that destroyed data in destructive wiper\-style attacks 
cost an average of $4\.69 million. The percentage of 
companies where ransomware was a factor in the

Executive summary
How we calculate the 
cost of a data breach
To calculate the average cost of a data breach, this 
research excludes very small and very large breaches. 
Data breaches examined in the 2021 study ranged in size 
between 2,000 and 101,000 compromised records. We 
use a separate analysis to examine the costs of very large 
“mega breaches,” which we explore in further detail in the 
complete findings section of the report. 
 
This research uses an accounting method called 
activity\-based costing, which identifies activities and 
assigns a cost according to actual use. Four process\-related 
activities drive a range of expenditures associated with 
an organization’s data breach: detection and escalation, 
notification, post breach response and lost business. 
 
For a more in\-depth explanation of the methods used for 
this report, see the section on research methodology.

The Cost of a Data Breach Report is a global report, combining results from 
537 organizations across 17 countries and regions, and 17 industries to provide 
global averages. However, in some cases, the report breaks out the results by 
country/region or industry for comparative purposes. Although sample sizes in 
some countries/regions and industries are quite small, the organizations in the 
study have been selected in an attempt to be representative.

Initial attack vectors
This section looks at the prevalence and cost of initial attack vectors of data 
breaches. The breaches in the study are divided into 10 initial attack vectors, 
ranging from accidental data loss and cloud misconfiguration to phishing, 
insider threats, and lost or stolen (i.e., compromised) credentials.

Average total cost and frequency of 
data breaches by initial attack vector 
Measured in US$ millions
Figure 8
The most common initial attack vector in 2021 
was compromised credentials, responsible for 
20% of breaches.
In 2021, the most frequent initial attack vectors were (1\) 
compromised credentials, 20% of breaches (2\) phishing, 
17% (3\) cloud misconfiguration, 15%. Business email 
compromise was responsible for only 4% of breaches but 
had the highest average total cost at $5\.01 million. The 
second costliest initial attack vector was phishing ($4\.65 
million), followed by malicious insiders ($4\.61 million), 
social engineering ($4\.47 million), and compromised 
credentials ($4\.37 million). The top four initial attack 
vectors were the same in 2021 as compared to the 2020 
study, but slightly re\-ordered. Phishing moved up from 
fourth to second most common, and cloud misconfiguration 
fell from second to third\-most common. Vulnerabilities in 
third\-party software (average cost of $4\.33 million) fell 
from third to fourth in frequency, a category that was the 
initial attack vector in 14% of breaches in 2021, compared 
to about 16% of breaches in 2020\.

Lifecycle of a breach
The time elapsed between the first detection of the breach and its containment 
is referred to as the data breach lifecycle. The average time to identify describes 
the time it takes to detect that an incident has occurred. The time to contain 
refers to the time it takes for an organization to resolve a situation once it has 
been detected and ultimately restore service. These metrics can be used 
to determine the effectiveness of an organization’s incident response and 
containment processes.

Average total cost of a data breach based 
on average data breach lifecycle  
Measured in US$ millions
Figure 11
A data breach lifecycle of less than 200 days produced 
a cost savings of nearly a third over a breach lifecycle 
longer than 200 days.
A breach with a lifecycle over 200 days cost an average 
of $4\.87 million in 2021, vs. $3\.61 million for a breach 
with a lifecycle of less than 200 days. The gap of $1\.26 
million represents a difference of 29\.7%. This gap between 
breaches with a lifecycle shorter/longer than 200 days 
was $1\.12 million in 2020\. That means the beneficial cost 
impact of containment in less than 200 days grew from 
2020 to 2021\.

Average total cost of a data breach with 
incident response (IR) team and IR plan testing 
Measured in US$ millions
Figure 12
Incident response teams and incident response plan 
testing continued to mitigate costs in 2021\.
The gap in average total cost between breaches at 
organizations with both IR teams and IR plan testing 
(IR capabilities), and organization with no IR team and 
no IR plan testing continued to grow. Breaches at 
organizations with IR capabilities cost an average of 
$3\.25 million in 2021, compared to $3\.32 million in 2020\. 
The average total cost of a breach at organizations with no 
IR capabilities was $5\.71 million in 2021, an increase from 
$5\.09 million in 2020\. The average total cost gap between 
IR capabilities vs. no IR capabilities was $2\.46 million in 
2021, representing a 54\.9% difference. 
The average cost difference between breaches at 
organizations with IR capabilities and organizations without 
IR capabilities was 42\.1% in 2020\. This indicates a growing 
cost difference effectiveness of IR capabilities from 2020 to 
2021 (difference of $2\.46 million in 2021 vs. $1\.77 million 
in 2020\). The average total cost of a breach at organizations 
with IR capabilities had a difference of 26\.4% compared to

Regulatory compliance failures
This year’s research study looked closely at the impacts of regulatory compliance 
failures. In this section, we first looked at the impact of compliance failures on 
the average total cost of a data breach. Out of a selection of 25 cost factors that 
either amplify or mitigate data breach costs, compliance failures was the top 
cost amplifying factor. 
Key finding
$5\.65m
Average cost of a breach at organizations with 
high level compliance failures
We then looked at the difference in “longtail costs” in 
breaches at organizations in highly regulated industries 
versus those in industries with less stringent data protection 
regulations. We defined highly regulated industries to include 
energy, healthcare, consumer goods, financial, technology, 
pharmaceuticals, communication, public sector and 
education. Organizations in retail, industrial, entertainment, 
media, research services, and hospitality were considered 
to be in a low regulatory environment. In the analysis of 
industries in the high versus low regulation categories, 
we concluded that regulatory and legal costs may have 
contributed to higher costs in the years following a breach.

Average distribution of data breach costs over 
time in low vs. high regulatory environments 
Percentage of total costs accrued in three month intervals

Breaches in stricter regulatory environments 
tended to see more costs accrue in later years 
following the breach.
The difference between high regulatory environments 
and low regulatory environments was most pronounced 
in breach costs incurred more than two years after the 
breach. In highly regulated industries, 20% of costs were 
incurred after two years, vs. 11% of costs in less regulated 
industries. Overall averages found that 16% of breach costs 
were incurred after two years. In less regulated industries, 
68% of costs were incurred in the first 12 months, vs. 46% 
of costs in highly regulated industries. Note: This research 
examined a sample of breaches over two\-plus years – 83 
breaches in a high regulatory environment and 101 in a 
low regulatory environment.

Impact of zero trust
For the first year, this study examined the prevalence and impact of a 
zero trust security architecture. This approach operates on the assumption 
that user identities or the network itself may already be compromised, 
and instead relies on AI and analytics to continuously validate connections 
between users, data and resources.

Costs stayed lower for organizations in the mature 
stage of zero trust.
The average cost of a data breach was higher for 
organizations that had not deployed/not started to deploy 
zero trust. Costs for those that had zero trust depend on 
level of maturity. The average cost of a breach was $5\.04 
million in 2021 for those with no zero trust approach. 
In mature stage of deployment, the average cost of 
a breach was $3\.28 million. This difference of $1\.76 million 
between mature zero trust organizations and organizations 
without zero trust is a cost difference of 42\.3%. 
The difference between early stage zero trust (average 
cost of a breach $4\.38 million) and mature stage ($3\.28 
million) was $1\.10 million, for a cost difference of 28\.7%.

Complete findings
Use of strong encryption, a key component of 
zero trust, was a top mitigating cost factor.
In an analysis of 25 cost factors that either amplified or 
mitigated the average total cost of a data breach, use of 
high standard encryption was third among cost mitigating 
factors, after mature use of AI platforms and mature 
use of analytics. 
Organizations using high standard encryption (using at 
least 256 AES encryption, at rest and in motion), had an 
average total cost of a breach of $3\.62 million, compared 
to $4\.87 million at organizations using low standard or 
no encryption, a difference of $1\.25M or 29\.4%.

Security AI and automation
This was the fourth year we examined the relationship between data breach 
cost and security automation. In this context, security automation refers to 
enabling security technologies that augment or replace human intervention 
in the identification and containment of incidents and intrusion attempts. 
Such technologies depend upon artificial intelligence, machine learning, 
analytics and automated security orchestration.

Average cost of a data breach by 
security automation deployment level  
Measured in US$ millions
Figure 21
Complete findings
The biggest cost savings in the study was to 
organizations with high levels of security 
AI and automation.
Organizations with no security automation experienced 
breach costs of $6\.71 million on average in 2021, vs. 
$2\.90 million on average at organizations with fully 
deployed security automation. 
In 2020, organizations without security AI/automation 
saw breach costs of $6\.03M, vs. $2\.45M with fully 
deployed security automation, a difference of $3\.58 million, 
or 84\.4%. Between 2019 and 2021, the cost of a 
breach at organizations with fully deployed security 
automation increased.

Complete findings
Organizations with fully deployed 
security AI and automation were 
able to detect and contain a 
breach must more quickly than 
organizations with no security 
AI/automation deployed. 
For organizations with fully deployed security AI/
automation, it took an average of 184 days to identify 
the breach and 63 days to contain the breach, for a total 
lifecycle of 247 days. 
 
For organizations with no security AI/automation 
deployed, it took an average of 239 days to identify 
the breach and 85 days to contain, for a total lifecycle 
of 324 days. The difference in breach lifecycle of 77 
days represents a difference of 27%. For fully deployed 
organizations, a breach occurring on January 1 would on 
average take until September 4 to identify and contain. 
 
For organizations with no automation deployed, a breach 
on January 1 would take on average until November 20 
to identify and contain.

COVID\-19 and remote work
This is the second year of this report that has been published during the 
pandemic. Last year, the pandemic began after most of the breaches in the study 
had already happened, so we re\-surveyed organizations to get their predictions 
about how remote working due to COVID\-19 would impact breach costs and the 
breach lifecycle. For this year’s report we were able to assess the impacts of 
remote working on breaches that all occurred during the pandemic.

Cost of a mega breach
Mega breaches, those with more than 1 million compromised records, 
are not the normal experience for most businesses. But mega breaches 
have an outsized impact on consumers and industries. The average cost 
of a mega breach has continued to grow since we introduced this analysis 
in the 2018 study. 
Key finding
$401m
Average total cost for breaches of 
50 million to 65 million records
This year’s investigation is based on the analysis of 14 companies that experienced a data breach involving the loss or theft of 
1 million or more records. For a full explanation of our methodology, see the cost of a data breach FAQ at the end of this report.

Risk quantification
Risk quantification can help organizations identify and 
prioritize security risk to inform decisions such as deploying 
new technologies, making investments in their business, 
and changing processes. CISOs, risk managers and security 
teams can use benchmark research like the Cost of a Data 
Breach Report to infer general trends and cost averages in 
their industry or geography. 
 
However, using data specific to the organization, rather 
than industry averages, organizations can get clarity and 
understanding on potential security gaps and how to reduce 
overall risk by quantifying security risk into financial terms. 
Below we explain how the Factor Analysis of Information 
Risk (FAIR), an open international standard for cyber risk 
modeling, combined with threat intelligence, can help 
organizations assess the potential impacts of cyber risks 
through financial projections and probabilities.
Quantifying security risk
Security is a business problem. Board executives and business leaders want 
to know the likelihood of a cyber incident occurring and the impact to the 
company’s ability to produce and sell its products or services as well as 
the potential impact to the brand.

Risk quantification
We then use threat intelligence from IBM Security X\-Force 
to assess the capability of the threat actor and their 
probability to attack. 
 
We take these variables through statistical analysis 
using Monte Carlo Simulations to estimate the range of 
financial loss. Understanding these key variables allows 
an organization to identify gaps in current controls or 
processes that put them at risk for larger financial loss. 
 
We can define the material impact of security gaps 
into components of primary and secondary loss; 
with primary loss being the loss associated with 
managing and responding to the event and secondary 
loss being the loss associated with outside parties such 
as regulatory bodies, customers and the stock market. 
 
Once we understand the potential financial loss an 
organization faces, we can look at cost\-benefit and 
ROI analysis into possible investments around mitigating 
controls or processes. For example, improvements 
around security awareness training can help to reduce 
threat event frequency, or changes to the identity and 
access management program can help minimize the 
size of a breach. 
 
Data from the IBM X\-Force Threat Intelligence Index 
shows us that the banking and financial services industry 
is a highly targeted sector of business year after year. 
In this example, we look at a hypothetical loss event in 
financial services.
Case study
How IBM Security uses FAIR in risk modeling 
To quantify risk specific to your organization, IBM Security uses the FAIR model to 
estimate the probability of a data breach and size of the breach in financial terms. 
We look at variables such as frequency of breach events, vulnerabilities 
and strength of security.

This hypothetical scenario analyzes the risk associated 
with a malicious external actor gaining access to a sensitive 
database and using ransomware to halt operations and 
extort the organization by threatening to expose stolen 
data publicly. 
 
In a real\-world client engagement, our assumptions, 
which serve as data inputs for our analysis, are gathered 
via consultative workshops. In this scenario, we use 
financial industry averages and learnings from previous 
client engagements as inputs to run the statistical analysis.

Security recommendations
Invest in security orchestration, automation and 
response (SOAR) to help improve detection and 
response times. 
In the cost of a data breach study, security AI and 
automation significantly reduced the average time to 
identify and respond to a data breach had a lower 
average cost. SOAR and SIEM software, and managed 
detection and response and services, can help your 
organization accelerate incident response with automation, 
process standardization and integration with your existing 
security tools. Automation technologies including artificial 
intelligence, analytics and automated orchestration were 
all associated with lower than average data breach costs. 
 
 
Adopt a zero trust security model to help prevent 
unauthorized access to sensitive data.
Results from the study showed that just 35% of 
organizations had implemented a zero trust security 
approach. However, those in the mature stage of their zero 
trust deployment had an average breach cost that was 
$1\.76 million less than organizations without zero trust. 
As organizations have shifted to incorporate remote work 
and more disconnected, hybrid multicloud environments, 
a zero trust strategy can help protect data and resources 
by making them accessible only on a limited basis and in 
the right context. 
Stress test your incident response plan to increase 
cyber resilience.
Organizations in the study who have formed incident 
response (IR) teams and tested their incident response 
plans saw an average total cost of a data breach that 
was $2\.46 million less than organizations that 
experienced a breach without an IR team or a tested 
IR plan. The mantra “train like you fight and fight like 
you train” means developing and testing incident 
response playbooks to help optimize your ability to 
respond quickly and effectively to attacks. 
 
 
Use tools that help protect and monitor endpoints 
and remote employees.
In the study, organizations that had more than 60% 
of their employees working remotely in response to the 
COVID\-19 pandemic had a higher than average cost of 
a data breach. Unified endpoint management (UEM) 
and identity and access management (IAM) products 
and services can help provide security teams with deeper 
visibility into suspicious activity on company and bring 
your own (BYO) laptops, desktops, tablets, mobile devices 
and IoT, including endpoints the organization doesn’t 
have physical access to, speeding investigation 
and response time to isolate and contain the damage.

Security recommendations
Invest in governance, risk management 
and compliance programs. 
An internal framework for audits, evaluating risk across 
the enterprise and tracking compliance with governance 
requirements can help improve an organization’s ability 
to detect a data breach and escalate containment efforts. 
The FAIR risk quantification methodology can help 
ascertain the probability of security incidents and calculate 
the associated costs in business value. Quantifying the 
cost of a potential breach can help in the decision\-making 
process for allocating resources. 
 
 
Embrace an open security architecture and minimize 
the complexity of IT and security environments. 
In this year’s study, complexity of IT and security 
systems and extensive cloud migration were among the 
top factors contributing to higher average data breach 
costs. Security tools with the ability to share data between 
disparate systems can help security teams detect 
incidents across complex hybrid multicloud environments. 
A managed security services provider can also help 
simplify security and risk with continuous monitoring 
and integrated solutions and services.
Protect sensitive data in cloud environments 
using policy and encryption. 
With the increasing amount and value of data being hosted 
in cloud environments, organizations should take steps to 
protect cloud\-hosted databases. Use data classification 
schema and retention programs to help bring visibility into 
and reduce the volume of the sensitive information that is 
vulnerable to a breach, and protect it using data encryption 
and fully homomorphic encryption. Use vulnerability 
scanning, penetration testing and red teaming to help 
identify cloud\-hosted database vulnerability exposures 
and misconfigurations.
Recommendations for security practices are for educational 
purposes and do not guarantee results.

Research methodology
The numerical value obtained from the number line, rather 
than a point estimate for each presented cost category, 
preserved confidentiality and ensured a higher response 
rate. The benchmark instrument also required practitioners 
to provide a second estimate for indirect and opportunity 
costs, separately. 
 
To ensure a manageable size for the benchmarking 
process, we carefully limited items to only those cost 
activity centers that we considered crucial to data 
breach cost measurement. Based upon discussions with 
experts, the final set of items included a fixed set of cost 
activities. Upon collection of the benchmark information, 
each instrument was re\-examined carefully for 
consistency and completeness.
The scope of data breach cost items contained within 
our benchmark instrument was limited to known cost 
categories that applied to a broad set of business 
operations that handle personal information. 
 
We believed that a study focused on business process 
— and not data protection or privacy compliance 
activities — would yield better quality results.
Research methodology
To preserve confidentiality, the benchmark instrument did not capture any 
company\-specific information. Data collection methods did not include actual 
accounting information but instead relied upon participants estimating direct 
costs by marking a range variable on a number line. Participants were instructed 
to mark the number line in one spot between the lower and upper limits of a range 
for each cost category.

Research methodology
What is a data breach? 
A breach is defined as an event in which an individual’s 
name and a medical record and/or a financial record or 
debit card is potentially put at risk — either in electronic or 
paper format. Breaches included in the study ranged from 
2,000 to 101,000 compromised records. 
 
What is a compromised record? 
A record is information that identifies the natural person 
(individual) whose information has been lost or stolen 
in a data breach. Examples include a database with an 
individual’s name, credit card information and other 
personally identifiable information (PII) or a health record 
with the policyholder’s name and payment information. 
 
How do you collect the data? 
Our researchers collected in\-depth qualitative data 
through nearly 3,500 separate interviews with individuals 
at 537 organizations that suffered a data breach between 
May 2020 and March 2021\. Interviewees included IT, 
compliance and information security practitioners 
who are knowledgeable about their organization’s data 
breach and the costs associated with resolving the breach. 
For privacy purposes, we did not collect organization\-
specific information. 
 
How do you calculate the cost? 
To calculate the average cost of a data breach, we collected 
both the direct and indirect expenses incurred by the 
organization. Direct expenses include engaging forensic 
experts, outsourcing hotline support and providing free 
credit monitoring subscriptions and discounts for future 
products and services. Indirect costs include 
in\-house investigations and communication, as well 
as the extrapolated value of customer loss resulting 
from turnover or diminished customer acquisition 
rates. Only events directly relevant to the data breach 
experience are represented in this research. For example, 
new regulations such as the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer 
Privacy Act (CCPA) may encourage organizations to 
increase investments in their cybersecurity governance 
technologies, but do not directly affect the cost of a data 
breach as presented in this research. For consistency 
with prior years, we use the same currency translation 
method rather than adjusting accounting costs. 
 
How does benchmark research differ from 
survey research? 
The unit of analysis in the Cost of a Data Breach Report 
is the organization. In survey research, the unit of analysis 
is the individual. We recruited 537 organizations to 
participate in this study. 
 
Can the average per record cost be used to 
calculate the cost of breaches involving millions 
of lost or stolen records? 
The average cost of data breaches in our research 
does not apply to catastrophic or mega data breaches, 
such as Equifax, Capital One or Facebook. These are not 
typical of the breaches many organizations experience. 
Hence, to draw useful conclusions in understanding data 
breach cost behaviors, we target data breach incidents 
that do not exceed 100,000 records. 
It is not consistent with this research to use the per record 
cost to calculate the cost of single or multiple breaches 
totaling millions of records. However, the study uses a 
simulation framework for measuring the cost impact 
of a “mega breach” involving 1 million or more records, 
based on a sample of 14 very large breaches of this size. 
 
Why are you using simulation methods to 
estimate the cost of a mega data breach? 
The sample size of 14 companies experiencing a mega 
breach is too small to perform a statistically significant 
analysis using activity\-based cost methods. To remedy 
this issue, we deploy Monte Carlo simulation to estimate 
a range of possible (random) outcomes through repeated 
trials. In total, we performed more than 150,000 trials. 
The grand mean of all sample means provides a most 
likely outcome at each size of data breach – ranging from 
1 million to 65 million compromised records. 
 
Are you tracking the same organizations each year? 
Each annual study involves a different sample of 
companies. To be consistent with previous reports, 
we recruit and match companies each year with 
similar characteristics such as the company’s industry, 
headcount, geographic footprint and size of data breach. 
Since starting this research in 2005, we have studied the 
data breach experiences of 4,477 organizations.

Research methodology
Non\-statistical results 
Our study draws upon a representative, non\-statistical 
sample of global entities. Statistical inferences, margins of 
error and confidence intervals cannot be applied to these 
data given that our sampling methods are not scientific. 
 
Non\-response 
Non\-response bias was not tested, so it is possible that 
companies that did not participate are substantially 
different in terms of underlying data breach cost. 
 
Sampling\-frame bias 
Because our sampling frame is judgmental, the quality 
of results is influenced by the degree to which the frame 
is representative of the population of companies being 
studied. It is our belief that the current sampling frame 
is biased toward companies with more mature privacy or 
information security programs. 
Company\-specific information 
The benchmark does not capture company\-identifying 
information. It allows individuals to use categorical 
response variables to disclose demographic information 
about the company and industry category. 
 
Unmeasured factors 
We omitted variables from our analyses such as leading 
trends and organizational characteristics. The extent to 
which omitted variables might explain benchmark results 
cannot be determined. 
 
Extrapolated cost results 
While certain checks and balances can be incorporated 
into the benchmark process, it is always possible that 
respondents did not provide accurate or truthful responses. 
In addition, the use of cost extrapolation methods rather 
than actual cost data may inadvertently introduce bias 
and inaccuracies. 
Extrapolated cost results 
This year, a strong U.S. dollar significantly influenced the 
global cost analysis. The conversion from local currencies 
to the U.S. dollar deflated the per record and average total 
cost estimates. For purposes of consistency with prior 
years, we decided to continue to use the same accounting 
method rather than adjust the cost.
Research limitations
Our study utilizes a confidential and proprietary benchmark method that has been 
successfully deployed in earlier research. However, there are inherent limitations 
with this benchmark research that need to be carefully considered before drawing 
conclusions from findings.
