Pre\-pandemic, the vulnerability disclosure landscape tended to follow the same behaviors year\-to\-year. Every quarter, 

vulnerability disclosures would closely match the count from the same period in the previous year. And then, by year end, the 

total would incrementally exceed the previous year’s. 

However, in 2020 Q1 we saw a major and sudden drop of 19\.8% in disclosed vulnerabilities. Out of all the external factors, 

COVID\-19 was the most likely underlying cause, though nothing could be specifically attributed to the pandemic. Since then, 

while the total vulnerability count has steadily caught up over the past two years, COVID always appeared to influence the 

numbers. 

Now that we have a full picture of 2021, it looks as if the vulnerability landscape has truly returned to normal. And while the 

normalization of the space may seem comforting, for struggling organizations it is not. Vulnerabilities have increased by a 

noticeable margin, and 2021 can now be credited with the most disclosures on record. 

There are too many vulnerabilities for organizations to remediate all of them, and they are being disclosed too quickly for 

organizations and security teams to keep up with. As usual, this includes CVE / NVD. In a world where issues like Log4Shell can 

appear at any time, organizations need proper vulnerability intelligence in order to make risk\-based decisions. We hope that this 

report demonstrates why Better Data Matters® as organizations strive to make those decisions. 

The 2021 Year End Vulnerability QuickView Report covers vulnerabilities disclosed between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 

2021\. 

Key Highlights 

• 

• 

• 

Risk Based Security’s VulnDB® team aggregated 28,695 vulnerabilities that were disclosed during 2021\. That total is the 

highest number on record. 

Spikes of vulnerability disclosures are occasionally occurring outside of routine ‘Patch Tuesdays’, with one such event 

resulting in 287 vulnerabilities released in a single day. 

4,108 vulnerabilities disclosed in 2021 were remotely exploitable, with both a public exploit and documented solution 

information. By focusing on these issues first, organizations can potentially reduce their risk and immediate workload by 

nearly 86%. 

• Of the vulnerabilities disclosed during 2021, 29% do not have a CVE ID, while an additional 4% have a CVE ID assigned 

but are in RESERVED status. This means that no actionable information about the vulnerability is yet available in 

CVE / NVD. 

• 

CVE / NVD’s inability to report on 33% of 2021’s vulnerabilities results in a loss of visibility for organizations seeking to 

replicate the best practice of focusing on remotely exploitable vulnerabilities that have a public exploit and also a 

documented solution.

Log4Shell: How “Big” Is It? 

VIEWPOINT by Brian Martin 

By now, the entire world is hopefully aware of what Log4Shell is, and why it’s a major problem. Since its discovery at the end of 

November last year, the news has been dominated by headlines touting its impact and how organizations need to pay attention, 

stop, and remediate Log4j issues. While more and more articles are published, each of them seems to be asking the same 

question, but they all seem unable to give a clear answer: Just how “big” is Log4Shell? 

L O G 4 S HE LL I S A M E GA \-VU LN E RA B IL IT Y 

If you are not familiar with what we do at RBS, or what VulnDB is, we can start with the fact that it is the most comprehensive, 

detailed, and timely source of vulnerability intelligence available on the market. That means the data that we provide our 

customers is independently aggregated, containing vulnerabilities found in IT, OT, IoT, CoTS, and third party libraries and 

dependencies. 

VulnDB details over 280,000 vulnerabilities, including over 91,000 that CVE/NVD fails to report. This context helps us fully explain 

and contextualize Log4Shell’s size and impact, since it has become what we call a “mega\-vulnerability”. 

This term describes entries that take up significant bandwidth in our database, and notable “mega\-vuln” entries include Spectre, 

POODLE, and Heartbleed. At first glance, it may seem that there’s a correlation between size and infamy, but the amount of 

attention a vulnerability receives is not the defining factor. Rather, to qualify as a mega\-vulnerability, entries need to have 

hundreds or even thousands of vulnerability references while affecting a tremendous amount of products and vendors. The 

accompanying charts illustrate how Log4Shell compares among its peer group.

Most mega\-vulnerabilities take years to accumulate references and affected vendors/product information. But in just a month, 

Log4Shell has surpassed every other mega\-vulnerability, except for one. At this time, there are over 1,850 vulnerability 

references specifically citing Log4Shell and its variants, and they affect over 6,200 vendors/product combinations. Of those, over 
275 are unique vendors and 1,677 unique products, meaning that some organizations will likely be impacted several times over. 

In terms of affected vendors and products, Log4Shell falls slightly behind POODLE. However, if Log4Shell\-related vendor 

advisories continue at their current pace, it will likely surpass POODLE within the next month. Nevertheless, the main highlight is 
the incredible amount of Log4Shell references circulating on the web. 

Out of all 280,000 known vulnerabilities, Log4Shell has the most references by a wide margin. This means that there is an 

incredible amount of existing information out there. But if that’s the case, why are organizations seemingly struggling to mitigate 

and remediate affected assets?

Despite the plethora of available information, organizations typically don’t have a tool that aggregates every known reference in 

one place. Vulnerability references provide much needed context for an issue, making it essential for intelligence vendors to 
constantly update their entries (especially Log4Shell) with as many of them as possible. 

Even though they should, most vulnerability intelligence vendors do not do this. References can contain new information that 

could drastically affect the impact, severity, or solution availability for a given vulnerability. It’s common to see a vulnerability 

disclosed that does not initially have every detail needed to properly triage it. Key details like location, exploitability, or solution 

information are often found after the vulnerability’s initial disclosure, and they can come from third\-party sources that are 
unrelated to the originating vendor. 

As such, vulnerability references play a critical role in contextualizing the risk that an issue poses to organizations. By taking 

advantage of a feed that captures them and includes them with the actual vulnerability entry, organizations will be better 

informed if they need additional details specific to a vendor or product. Without references, security teams may question the 

provenance of the information in the vulnerability database. And when it comes to Log4Shell, security professionals don’t have 
the resources to scour the internet for every mention. 

But depending on where you get your vulnerability data, hours spent researching Log4j issues will only scratch the surface. This 

is especially true if using publicly sourced data from CVE/NVD:

Although CVE disclaims that its list of vulnerability references should not be considered complete, in the end, what is provided 

simply doesn’t benefit the end user. On the other hand, VulnDB catalogs over 1,850 Log4Shell references compared to MITRE’s 

list of around 100, meaning that CVE/NVD users will be forced to find as much as 95% of the information that is actually available 

themselves. 

T H E I MP O RT AN C E OF S TA ND A RD IZ E D D AT A 

Some skeptics may argue that providing every reference could actually just overload security teams instead of providing a 

benefit. And in the age of overwhelming amounts of data, this concern has merit. If we were to dump every known reference on 

organizations without validating their value, the sheer amount of data may render the information unserviceable. But what if 

every vulnerability reference was sorted based on their contents and relevancy, with options to consume based on affected 
CPEs? 

This is the importance of an independently researched, comprehensive, and detailed vulnerability database. By being proactive 

in searching and capturing published details, we are able to provide organizations with a more complete picture, allowing 
security professionals to make informed risk\-based decisions.

Log4j Chatter: What Threat Actors Are Sharing About the 

Log4Shell Vulnerability 

VIEWPOINT by Flashpoint’s Global Threat Intelligence Team 

Since the Apache Log4j disclosure in December, organizations are feverishly attempting to identify and patch all potential 

vulnerabilities to their systems and infrastructure. In the meantime, threat actors across various illicit communities are actively 
discussing ways to exploit and further monetize this vulnerability. 

Below, we break down the most significant chatter amongst threat actor groups, with a particular focus on deep and dark web 

forums XSS, Raid, and RAMP. 

T H E C HA TT E R ON XSS 

In December, just a few days after the vulnerability was published, Flashpoint analysts identified a thread on the top\-tier Russian\-

language hacking forum XSS titled “CVE\-2021\-44228 Apache log4j RCE”, in which threat actors actively discussed Log4Shell\-

related activity, including: 

• 

• 

• 

Information sharing on proof\-of\-concept (PoC) exploits for Log4Shell 

Contributing to mapping out the Log4Shell attack surface 

Providing information on how to scan for systems vulnerable to Log4Shell 

• Web application firewall (WAF) evasion payloads 

• 

• 

Sharing information on how to bypass Cloudflare protections to deliver a Log4Shell exploit payload 

Sharing updates on patch releases for Log4Shell 

L O G 4 J A ND G I T HUB: H O W T HR E AT ACT O RS W E AP O N IZ E O P EN \-S OU RC E C O D E R E P OS 

The majority of the information shared in the Log4Shell\-related XSS thread identified by Flashpoint is derived from GitHub 

repositories. GitHub initially removed repositories containing PoC exploits for Log4Shell to give administrators extra time to 

patch, given the severity of the vulnerability. Threat actors on XSS were quickly aware of this and in response, posted cloned 
GitHub repositories containing Log4Shell PoC exploits before GitHub had the opportunity to remove them. 

This activity demonstrates a clear intersection between GitHub and cybercriminal communities. GitHub repositories remain a 

primary resource for threat actors, even amid GitHub’s attempts to remove repositories containing malicious artifacts.

R A ID F O RUM S 

Threat actors on the English\-language illicit community Raid Forums were actively involved in propagating the following 
information related to Log4Shell: 

• New plugins for popular vulnerability scanning tools tailored toward identifying systems vulnerable to Log4Shell 

• 

• 

Custom tools designed to scan for systems vulnerable to Log4Shell 

PoC exploits for Log4Shell 

Raid Forum admins were aware that chatter about Log4Shell would likely bring increased attention to the forum by law 

enforcement and press. As a result, Raid Forum admins consistently removed threads containing information related to 

Log4Shell. However, similar to GitHub, threat actors on Raid quickly downloaded shared PoC exploits and tools before admins 

had the opportunity to remove them.

On December 11, within the general chat box of the ransomware forum RAMP, several threat actors said they had not heard 

from the ransomware group “LockBit” for a while. One individual stated that LockBit is working on Log4Shell but did not provide 
details about the type of work the ransomware collective is allegedly conducting. 

Notably, LockBit’s spokesperson on RAMP often openly criticizes RAMP admins, referring to the forum as a “cop forum.” While 
the aforementioned comment could be a joke, Flashpoint has continued to actively monitor RAMP for any further information.

Vulnerability Trends in 2021 

2021 At A Glance

Figure 1: Number of vulnerabilities disclosed by EOY, in the last five years 

For two years, COVID has had an observable, yet uncertain impact on vulnerability disclosures. However, 2021 year end data 

suggests that the vulnerability landscape is officially returning to normal. While there are many variables that may impact the 

number of vulnerabilities disclosed, in our previous reports we theorized that several pandemic factors likely caused a decrease 

from what is usually seen in similar periods. 

Since then, a full view of 2021 shows that the total of new vulnerability disclosures has risen significantly in just the latter half of 

the year. Although not definitive proof, the major jump of disclosures suggests that COVID truly had influenced the numbers. It is 

easy to imagine that with changes from working in office to working from home, formerly disruptive routines have now become 

normal. Considering how security professionals have mostly adapted to their new environments, as well as the standard 

increases we tended to see pre\-pandemic, 2021’s jump makes sense. With at least 28,695 vulnerabilities disclosed last year, 2021 

has the highest number on record so far. 

However, the most interesting aspect to 2021’s total is the short time it took to exceed previous years. In the 2021 Mid Year 2021 

Report, the difference between 2020 and 2021 was only around 400\. In the second half of the year, that gap then increased by 

over 3,500\. This is a considerable increase, further lending to the idea that we are seeing the disclosure landscape shake off the 

pandemic as researchers return to their normal output.

In what has become a common pattern every year, the same 12 \- 15 products jockey for position on the “Top Products” chart. For 

those unfamiliar with this report, it is important to remind readers that these numbers are interesting in terms of volume, but 

should not be the basis for any product comparisons or assessments. With that in mind, there is a significant change in 2021 that 
stands out: no Microsoft Windows products!

Continuing the thought from the previous section, in 2019 we didn’t include a top product chart, but Microsoft was number 

seven on the top vendor list. Then in 2020 four Windows products occupied the Top Ten list. Now that there are no Windows 

products present on the Top Ten list, have Microsoft vulnerabilities dropped in 2021? The answer is a resounding yes. However, 

2020 was an unusually bad year for Microsoft, jumping from 944 to 1,593\. If 2020 was an abnormally bad year for Microsoft, 

then seeing a drop in 2021 would be expected. That, along with a steady increase in vulnerabilities affecting products from other 
vendors, would explain the absence of Microsoft Windows from the product chart above. 

With the 2021 top vendor chart, we see that despite the drop in Microsoft vulnerabilities, they still reached the number five spot. 

That tells us that while there were a considerable amount of vulnerabilities in their products, not one Microsoft product 

managed to reach the Top Ten. IBM also experienced this, being number one on the top vendor list while having no products 

make the Top 10 Product list. The reason is simple: for organizations with a sizable product portfolio, the distribution of 

vulnerabilities per product evens out and leads to a more nuanced take. Therefore, rather than assuming companies like IBM or 

Oracle are “the worst vendors” based on their overall vulnerability count, it is crucial to look closer at the product(s) deployed in 

your organization. Those product\-specific totals will be of more practical use. Further, depending on the quality of your 

vulnerability intelligence, having access to detailed metadata will be extremely useful in developing specific and contextualized 

metrics for your security teams.

Looking at 2021 over the full year, we can track disclosures by day. In the grand scheme of things, we know there is volatility in 

disclosures due to some vendors opting to follow ‘Patch Tuesday’, where they release patches on a given day of the month. This 

chart highlights just how severe that practice has become and the burden it can place on security teams even though it occurs at 
fairly regular intervals. 

However, this chart shows that there are also unexpected surges of disclosures. Notably, April 20 is not a ‘Patch Tuesday’ but had 

287 disclosures putting it the 7th highest for the year, ahead of some Patch Tuesdays. Conversely, we see that disclosures on any 

given day in January didn’t make the top ten days. Preparing for the usual days is important, but security teams must stay fluid 

and be ready to respond to high disclosure days that are ‘out of band’.

Figure 3: Number of existing vulnerability changes each day in 2021 

We have talked about the concept of a “living database” before, and the updates made to VulnDB continue to demonstrate the 

value of that approach. If you’re not familiar with the concept, it refers to our belief that vulnerability databases should be 

constantly revisited and updated as new details come to light. This graphic shows the number of daily updates made to VulnDB 

entries. These changes range from adding a reference to adding additional affected products or including a newly released 
solution. 

Updating previous records is vital because if a vulnerability is disclosed and isn’t coordinated with the vendor, it can be days, 

months or even years before a solution is made available. While your organization may have introduced mitigating controls, it is 

still extremely important to install the patch or upgrade when it becomes available. Relying on a “one and done” vulnerability 

database is not likely to help. While such a solution may provide the original information available at the time of initial disclosure, 

if it is not updated with subsequently available remediation information then your organization is missing out on crucial data 

needed to truly mitigate vulnerability\-related risk.

Importance of Proper Vulnerability Intelligence 

Figure 4: Breakdown of actionable vulnerabilities, by availability and ease of exploitation, disclosed by EOY 2021 

We’ve included the actionable severity chart in our past two reports, as well as in our monthly QuickView Infographics for a 

simple reason \- it succinctly demonstrates the value of quality vulnerability intelligence. Expecting any organization to triage, 

prioritize, and then remediate 28,695 vulnerabilities in one year is extremely unrealistic, and without a risk\-based approach, key 

issues are more likely to remain unpatched.

 PAGE 18 

To make the most effective use of time and resources, security teams should first focus on issues that are remotely exploitable, 

have a public exploit, and have documented solution information. By following this approach, organizations can focus on the 

4,108 vulnerabilities that fall into this category, potentially reducing their immediate workload by 86% while still addressing the 

most significant risks with which they are faced. This allows organizations to make an informed decision on how to prioritize the 

other 24,587, since vulnerabilities with all three stipulations will likely have the most impact, while being the easiest to remediate. 

However, even though this best practice can bring tangible improvements to the timeliness of any organization’s Vulnerability 

Management Program, if your vulnerability intelligence is poor, or is publicly sourced, this model may be theoretical at best. 

Figure 5: Breakdown of vulnerabilities compared to CVE in 2021 

RESERVED: 1,315 

No CVE: 8,215 

Live CVE: 19,165 

Figure 5, shows that in 2021, CVE / NVD failed to report 8,215 (29%) known disclosed vulnerabilities. In terms of actionability, this 

number is actually 9,530 (33%) since at the time of writing, 1,315 vulnerabilities are in RESERVED status in CVE. For those 

unfamiliar with the term, RESERVED status vulnerabilities are entries that have been given CVE IDs, but contain no details in the 

CVE database. As such, even though these entries are counted towards CVE’s total, RESERVED status vulnerabilities are 

completely unactionable.

Figure 6: Breakdown of actionable vulnerabilities, limited to CVE IDs, by availability and ease of exploitation, disclosed by EOY 2021 

However, CVE / NVD’s inability to detail 33% has a deeper impact on organizations using publicly\-sourced data to inform their 

Vulnerability Management Programs. Looking at figures 4 and 6 side\-by\-side shows that either CVE severely lacks coverage on 

remotely exploitable vulnerabilities, or has great difficulty in identifying remote code execution (RCE) entries. Either way, the end 

result is that security teams planning to use publicly sourced data will be unaware of 60% (1,659\) of the vulnerabilities that have 

all three stipulations, highlighting the importance of having comprehensive, detailed and timely intelligence.

Despite the vulnerability disclosure landscape shaking off the pandemic, there has been no celebratory fanfare. Now, it is back to 

business\-as\-usual and that means vulnerability disclosure counts will likely fall back into the pattern of increasing incrementally 
each year. As such, organizations that still adopt the mindset of “patch everything” will continue to struggle. 

The good news is that the industry is starting to make big leaps in how it views vulnerability management. Firms like Gartner are 

catching on to the inefficiencies caused by reliance on vulnerability scanners, while government agencies like the Cybersecurity 

Infrastructure and Security Agency are pushing for organizations to focus their prioritization on metadata like exploitability, 
rather than severity. 

All of these movements are educating organizations that it can be possible to proactively manage risk, rather than always 

reacting to it. As enterprises take the steps in assessing those possibilities, security teams will come to realize that it will all come 

down to the quality of data. To make informed risk\-decisions, they will come to understand that comprehensive, actionable, and 

timely vulnerability intelligence will be critical, and that it won’t be found in the public source. 

Methodology and Terms 

VulnDB® is derived from a proprietary methodology and daily analysis of thousands of vulnerability sources. Unlike some 

vulnerability database providers, Risk Based Security is constantly searching for and adding new sources, in addition to working 

closely with customers to ensure coverage of the products they use. 

VulnDB counts only distinct vulnerabilities. Products sharing the same vulnerable codebase are considered only one unique 

vulnerability. We do not consider vulnerabilities that affect multiple products as unique vulnerabilities as some vulnerability 

databases do, which artificially inflates their numbers. To be clear, a vulnerability in a third\-party library such as OpenSSL is 

treated as one vulnerability; the multiple projects using and integrating that code do not constitute additional unique 

vulnerabilities, and are not included in any VulnDB counts.
