Security Culture Report 2021Executive Summary 

Welcome to the 2021 Security Culture Report, the fourth annual report of its kind. The Security Culture 
Report and associated methodology was originally developed by CLTRe, which was acquired by 
KnowBe4 in 2019, and is KnowBe4 Research’s most ambitious report. The data represented here 
was collected during the global COVID\-19 pandemic and, as such, some findings from our research 
reflect both positive and negative inflections that may be attributable to pandemic conditions. 

Security culture is the ideas, customs 
and social behaviors of an organization 
that influence their security. Of 1,161 
security leaders surveyed in 2020, 94% 
reported\[1] that security culture is the 
most important element in their security 
strategy. This sentiment is reflected in the 
growth in the number of organizations 
measuring their security culture. 

More than 94% of security leaders 
around the world believe that 
security culture is critical.

More than 320,000 employees, in 
1,872 organizations around the world have been surveyed in this largest ever study of security 
culture. While some industries saw security culture stagnate or decline during the pandemic, we 
were encouraged to see a number of industries use the pandemic as an opportunity to improve.

Organizations with a poor 
security culture demonstrate a 
52\-time higher risk of employees 
sharing credentials.

Security culture is directly associated 
with reduced risk. In a recently published 
KnowBe4 Research report, we demonstrated 
that organizations with poor security culture 
have a risk that is 52 times higher for 
employees sharing credentials.\[2] As of yet, 
there are no industries that quantifiably 
demonstrate a good security culture, which 
is characterized by a score of 80 points 
or more. This is worrying when we see a 
continued growth in the threat level, and a growing number of victims of cybercrime. According to 
CoveWare, 2020 saw ransomware payments reach an all\-time high with organizations across all 
industries being targeted. The most common method used by hackers to gain access to their target 
systems is by social engineering. 

In their Q4 2020 Ransomware Marketplace Report, the ransomware remediation and analytics firm 
CoveWare noted that for the first time, phishing surpassed other techniques as the most common 
tool\[3] used by hackers to gain access. As such, organizations around the world—large and small—
should expect to see an increase in phishing attacks in the coming years. 

Security culture is a critical, need\-to\-have asset in the security toolbox. By assessing employees’ security 
awareness, behaviors and culture, organizations can adapt their policies and training programs to the 
constantly changing threat landscape. The alternative becomes less attractive by the hour: do nothing 
and see your organization crumble to a halt by ransomware, data theft or business interruption.

Summary of Findings

2020 was heavily influenced by the global effects of COVID\-19\. And we believe that we see 
pandemic\-related ripples within some of the year\-over\-year changes detected in security culture. 
This is a high\-level summary of the findings: 

Embracing Digital Transformation:

• 

• 

The education industry improved by two points. This improvement may be explained by 
education being moved from classrooms to virtual settings due to the COVID\-19 pandemic 
and the associated technology systems and training changes.

The legal industry also increased their score by two points. Again, we may explain this 
improvement by many legal processes and procedures being moved online.

Suffering from Chaos and Confusion:

On the other side of the spectrum, the news is not so good: 

• 

• 

• 

The Consumer Services industry dropped one point lower this year. This may be due to the 
reduction in the workforce during the pandemic. 

The Construction industry also scored one point lower than last year. Again, we believe this 
may be explained by the reduction in workforce due to the pandemic. 

The Business Services also scored one point lower this year. This sector has traditionally shown 
a high score, making this change somewhat surprising. 

Results from this year’s report revealed a large gap between the best performers and the poor 
performers. Unsurprisingly, the best performers were from Financial Services and Banking—industries 
with a long tradition of managing risk. However, being a “best performer” doesn’t necessarily equate 
to having performed at a desirable level, and these industries shouldn’t be too quick to congratulate 
themselves. For instance, a score of 76, as seen by Banking and Financial Services, is well below a 
Good security culture. Our research shows that moving from one security culture class to another is 
directly correlated to risk. By improving from the current class of Moderate to the next class of Good 
security culture, these industries will see a reduction by eight times of employees sharing credentials.\[4]

As in earlier reports, the Education industry is one of the worst performers, with a score of 70\. Even 
though Education is still at the bottom of the list, this industry has shown a significant improvement 
compared to earlier years and is now demonstrating Moderate security culture. This improvement 
helps reduce the risk of employees sharing credentials by three times.\[4]

Another industry that saw an improvement from last year is the Legal industry, with a new score of 
73\. This change may be explained by the pandemic forcing many legal and court operations online. 
Even if some users seem to struggle with the technology\[5], the adoption of technology is showing 
an improved security culture too.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/10/tech/cat\-lawyer\-zoom\-filter/index.html

Sharing the bottom placement with the Education sector is the Construction industry. Unlike the 
Education industry, Construction experienced a drop in their security culture during the pandemic. 
Other industries with a reduction in security culture are the Consumer Services industry, with a new 
score of 72, and Business Services, with a new score of 74\.

In this year’s report, we present a deep dive into security culture with the new report section, A 
Detailed Analysis of Security Culture. This section provides an in\-depth view to the state of specific 
aspects of security culture. We look at how employees consider their sentiments about having access 
to security\-related information, how they think about passwords and their access to the security team.

Security Culture Score

The mean and median of the total security culture score is 73\. Detailed analysis shows that the 
majority of all analyzed organizations managed to develop a mediocre or moderate security 
culture, while only a small portion of organizations have a good security culture. Alarmingly, a 
few organizations are scoring in the Poor bracket and no organizations have reached an Excellent 
security culture score yet.

What Is Security Culture

Security culture is the ideas, customs and social behaviors that impact an organization’s security. 
In information security culture, we look at how the cultural aspects influence the information 
management. In cybersecurity culture, the focus is on the part of information management that uses 
cyber technology to create, manipulate or store information and data.

The purpose of the security culture survey 
and the Security Culture Report is to provide 
an objective scientific method for assessing, 
reporting and comparing the relative 
information security culture\-related strengths 
and weaknesses of individuals, organizations, 
industry sectors, regions and more. 

Security culture: The ideas, 
customs and social behaviors of 
an organization that influence 
their security.

Security Culture Dimensions

We systematically evaluate culture across seven distinct dimensions; they are:

Attitudes

The feelings and beliefs that employees have 
toward the security protocols and issues.

Behaviors

The actions and activities of employees that 
have direct or indirect impact on the security 
of the organization.

Cognition

Employees’ understanding, knowledge and 
awareness of security issues and activities.

Communication

The quality of communication channels to 
discuss security\-related topics, promote a 
sense of belonging and provide support for 
security issues and incident reporting.

Compliance

The knowledge of written security policies and 
the extent that employees follow them.

Norms

The knowledge of and adherence to unwritten 
rules of conduct in the organization.

Responsibilities

How employees perceive their role as a 
critical factor in sustaining or endangering 
the security of the organization.

8

Security culture: The ideas, 

customs and social behaviors of 

an organization that influence 

their security.

Security Culture Index
The Security Culture Index is the scale used to measure security culture. Each of the Security Culture 
Dimensions are given a score, and then the total for all the dimensions is calculated. The mean of 
the total is the Security Culture Score, which is used to compare each industry and organization 
against the Security Culture Scale:

Poor

Mediocre

Moderate

Good

Excellent

0 up to 60

60 up to 70

70 up to 80

80 up to 90

90 up to 100

The Security Culture Disconnect
In the 2020 Security Culture Report, we reported a security culture disconnect globally. A large 
majority of security leaders worldwide reported that security culture is crucial for their security 
program. We showed that business principles are the main motivation for building a strong security 
culture. Building business success (49%), business integrity (43%) and a sense of customer security 
(41%) were security leaders’ top motivations for creating a strong security culture. However, we also 
reported that the same security leaders miss a common definition of security culture. This inability 
to define security culture leads to an over\-confidence for organizations’ security cultures. In 
our report this year, we demonstrate that the overconfidence is shown clearly in how 
organizations earn security culture scores: not one single industry earned a score of 

Good security culture. 

This lack of understanding security culture introduces a number of challenges 

for organizations’ abilities to build and maintain security cultures. 

We define security culture as the ideas, customs and social behaviors 
of an organization that influence their security. To work with security 
culture, we must first understand it. It should be clear that to measure 
and manage culture, we need to apply other tools, techniques and 
practices than traditional security controls. The Verizon DBIR 2020 
identifies phishing as the most common threat action. Research by 
KnowBe4 clearly demonstrates the value of assessing the phish\-
proneness of an organization and using that data to tailor training 
and education to each employee’s need.

Furthermore, data from KnowBe4 Research shows the immediate role 
of security culture in lowering employee\-induced risks in organizations. 
See our research paper Security Culture and Credential Sharing, 2021 
as an example; in this report, we demonstrate a direct link between the 
quality of a security culture and the number of employees sharing credentials 

in a phishing assessment.

A Detailed Analysis of 
Security Culture
How Security Culture Is Manifested in Organizations
In this section, we analyzed data from over 200,000 employees 
across the world to see how they feel about the information security 
in their organization. One of the things we are interested in is to learn 
what a Poor security culture looks like. Why? As mentioned previously, 
data show that there are great gains to be had by organizations 
to improve their security culture. For example, organizations with 
a Poor culture are 52 times more likely to share credentials than 
those with a Good security culture.\[6] By examining how employees 
report on specific topics, we can help their organization to improve 
security culture by focusing their efforts where it matters most. 
Specifically, we looked at how employees report their sentiments 
about having access to security\-related information, how they think 
about passwords and their access to the security team.

We do not receive 
enough training on 
information security

TRUE
20%

Employees’ Perceived Need 
for Training
Our analysis shows that one in five employees do not feel like they 
receive enough security information. The potential consequences of 
this are many. For instance, lack of information could be related to 
poor understanding of when employees need to report incidents and 
adhere to security standards. Providing information to employees 
is a fundamental building block for security behaviors. Given the 
many tools, resources and strategies created to tackle this specific 
issue, it is surprising that more organizations are not succeeding in 
this area. Organizations can leverage online training and ramp up 
internal employee engagement campaigns to address this issue, 
giving every employee access to the security information they need.

I will notice if 
my computer is 
compromised

TRUE
57%

Our analysis shows that 57% of employees believe that they 
would recognize if their device got hacked. This is alarming, given that many cybersecurity threats, 
including ransomware like Ryuk, can go undetected for months before detection by even the best 
organizations.\[7] Employee misperceptions are often consequences of organizations failing to 
properly train their employees. A proactive security awareness training program and continuous 
effort to improve security culture will help employees to recognize and address their blind spots.

Employees’ Understanding of Password Hygiene
The training of employees also impacts their understanding of why passwords are important. Our 
industry’s fast changing rules of what good password hygiene is complicates matters with password 
understanding. Over the past 30 years, security experts have trained employees to do contradictory 
things—from change their passwords every 30 days, to no need to change passwords unless they 
are in a breach; from limiting the number of characters (which 
interestingly, some services still seem to be doing) to having a 
minimum number of characters; from using only numbers or letters, 
to enforcing all kinds of numbers, symbols, letters and cases. It is no 
wonder why employees find it difficult to know what the rules are.

Short and simple 
passwords are not 
helping hackers

TRUE
24%

Do not understand 
why it is important to 
change passwords

TRUE
12%

Leaked, breached, shared or cracked passwords are still one of 
the most important methods for gaining illicit access to computer 
systems. Criminals have upped their game on social engineering 
and use a number of different strategies to gain access to what they 
ultimately want: your money. Earlier, we mentioned ransomware; 
another big hitter, Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks, have 
nearly doubled over the past year according to the Spear Phishing 
Report 5 from Barracuda.\[8] 

Our research shows that there is a large gap between what 
organizations teach, and what their employees internalize when 
it comes to password hygiene. In our analysis, we see that 24% of 
employees think that short and simple passwords do not increase 
the risk of an attack on the organization.

This indicates that employees need more training to understand how 
weak passwords are a risk to both themselves and their employer. 
Twelve percent report that they do not understand why it is necessary 
to change their passwords if only they know it. 

In 2020, we continued to see a large amount of data breaches 
resulting in leaked credentials according to Statista.\[9] KnowBe4 
data shows that one in four employees reuse their passwords across 
different services.\[10] If your employees do not understand the risk 
associated with bad password hygiene or the need to change 
stolen passwords, then training in this area is urgently needed to 
reduce risk.

11

Research by LastPass in 2019\[11] claims that at large enterprises, employees have an average of 
25 unique logins, and small businesses may have up to 80 unique logins. The number of unique 
services and logins are likely to be similar, even for the majority of organizations that are not using 
any password management solution. In our research, we found that 77% of the employees do 
not use any means to securely store their passwords. The fact that most employees are required to 
have a large number of logins, while they are not able to save their passwords in a secure location, 
suggests that most employees reuse passwords.

Employees’ Perception of IT 
Support Availability
One of the most important security measures for organizations should 
be to ensure all employees know what to do and who to contact 
in the case of a security incident. Our research shows that 30% of 
employees report that it is difficult to reach the security experts in their 
organization. When organizations fail to provide their employees 
with adequate processes and access to the specialists, a higher 
number of security breaches are to be expected.

The findings in this section serve as eye openers into how 
employees around the world report the state of security culture 
in their organizations. Organizations should take advantage of 
the relationship between security culture and risk by focusing 
their efforts on measuring and managing their security culture to 
ensure they keep improving. We recommend using a standard 
metric and a de facto benchmark to make it easier to know 
where your security culture currently stands.

How to Read the Industry Benchmark Page
Each industry sector has its own benchmark. This benchmark includes a description, data points 
and graphs. Each page is constructed in the same way, with a title, a description, a section on what 
and how to improve, an overview infographic, a box plot and a column graph. Together, these 
elements provide a wealth of information, presented in a way to make it easily accessible for any 
reader. Use the page for your industry to inform yourself, your team and your board of directors on 
the current state of your industry.

The report uses the Security Culture Index.

The Security Culture Index
The security culture index is the scale used 
to understand the security culture score. 
The scale ranges from 0 (worse) to 100 (best) 
and uses five levels that explain the quality of 
the security culture.

The security culture index levels are:

Excellent
Good
Moderate
Mediocre
Poor

90 up to 100
80 up to 90
70 up to 80
60 up to 70
0 up to 60

How to Read the 
Column Chart

Column charts use columns to compare 
data. In this report, they are used to 
compare the seven dimensions of security 
culture. The height of the bar indicates 
the score on the dimension. This makes it 
easy to compare the scores on different 
dimensions to see where the industry 
scored the highest, lowest and possibly 
equally. The bar chart also contains 
a horizontal line, which indicates the 
security culture score for the industry. 
Comparing each column to the line 
is useful in order to understand the 
industry´s strong and weak areas.

How to Read the Box Plot

A box plot is a visual representation of important statistics 
about the data. The box plot is used to easily understand how 
the data samples are represented across the scale being used. 
The security culture index uses a scale from 0 to 100, and the 
box plot visualizes where each organization’s security culture 
score falls within that range.

The line across the center of the plot is the median, which is 
the middle score of all the scores when they are sorted. The 
median is enclosed by a box; the start and end point of the box 
indicates the range within which the middle 50% of all scores 
fall. There are two lines sticking out from the box. The bottom 
line indicates where the lower 25% of the scores fall, and the 
upper line indicates where the top 25% of the scores fall. You 
might also see some circles on the plot, often referred to as 
outliers. These scores are very different from the others.

17

2020 was heavily influenced by the global 
effects of COVID\-19\. And we believe that we 
see pandemic\-related ripples within some of the 
year\-over\-year changes detected in security culture. 

18

Banking
Due to the high value of financial data, the Banking sector has long been 
familiar with risk management concepts. This, often coupled with government\-
required cybersecurity and employee training standards, drives this industry’s 
overall risk management strategy. The Banking sector’s security culture score 
of 76 is consistent with last year’s report.

Employee survey results from this sector are also generally consistent with last 
year, with only minor shifts in some dimensions. With a score of 79 in the Attitudes 
dimension, a one\-point decrease over last year, could be the result of a slight 
shift in thinking, as the industry grapples with the effects of COVID\-19 on day\-
to\-day work, with personnel working in shifts with less face\-to\-face interaction.

As with the previous year, both the Communication and Compliance 
dimensions maintained their score of 79\. The Banking industry maintains 
strong communications channels, which serve to enable their employees 
and an ongoing adherence to industry\-specific policies, both of which 
are vital to security culture. Customers, employees and regulators alike 
will need specific crisis communication strategies providing assurance that 
their risk management approach is solid, the financial institution remains 
secure and that they can continue business without downsizing.

Also consistent with last year’s findings are the security Behaviors of Banking 
industry employees. At 78, the Behaviors dimension reflects this industry’s 
consistent security\-based Behaviors. In order to maintain this favorable score, 
employees will need to anticipate attacks and instinctively understand how to 
navigate and report them. This will only happen through continuous training and 
the use of simulated phishing attacks to keep strengthening the security muscle.

Areas for Improvement
Moderate scores of 73 in Norms, a one\-point increase over last year, a 
73 in Responsibilities, also a one\-point increase and another 72 in the 
Cognition dimension, unchanged, provide clear areas of improvement for 
training and education programs.

Res

Although an improvement of the Norms 
dimension, which measures the unwritten 
rules related to security expectations and how 
employees are adopting them, is a welcome 
improvement, there is little overall shift in the 
industry’s overall benchmarks. The Banking 
industry’s employees are well accustomed to 
security training and will likely be highly receptive 
to a greater emphasis on their responsibilities 
towards and accounting for security norms.

Business Services
Organizations within the Business Services sector typically offer assistance 
in areas such as office administration, physical security, garbage disposal, 
cleaning services and hiring and placing personnel. This sector houses a 
large variety of organizations offering differing services, making for an 
interesting mix in overall measurement of descriptive statistics. Historically, 
this sector has been prone to a high percentage of targeted phishing 
attacks. Across small, medium and large Business Services organizations, 
there continues to be a high rate of susceptibility to being compromised, 
leading to a higher risk level. 

The Business Services sector continues to show a favorably healthy attitude 
toward security and a willingness to take appropriate measures to better 
secure their organizations and raise the readiness of their employees, with 
an overall score of 74\. A score of 77 in the Attitudes dimension, a one\-point 
decrease over last year, shows that employees continue to demonstrate a 
moderate eagerness to be compliant with security measures. Additionally, 
a good Communication dimension score of 79, also a one\-point increase 
over last year, shows that Business Services organizations are enthusiastic 
to share security information early and often in their overall efforts to 
connect with their user population. A consistent year\-over\-year moderate 
Compliance score of 75, continues to indicate that Business Services 
organizations are putting intentional focus on how they communicate, 
disseminate and reinforce security policies.

Areas for Improvement
The Business Services industry has a few clear areas for improvement. With 
a consistent Cognition score of 72 over last year, we see that although 
employees demonstrate an eagerness to be compliant with security measures 
as indicated above, the industry needs to adopt a higher commitment to 
provide meaningful and ongoing security awareness training for all employees.

We continue to see more moderate scores of 71 in Norms and 72 in 
Responsibilities, both unchanged. A strong commitment to comprehensive 
and continuous training and education will 
favorably impact these scores. Increased 
training and awareness, coupled with the 
already\-good communications demonstrated 
in this industry, will help strengthen employee 
understanding and buy\-in for security\-related 
behaviors and values. Creating a “security 
champion” (aka culture carrier) program can 
also be helpful here.

Construction
The Construction sector was impacted early by their inability to secure 
basic materials because of the COVID\-19 pandemic. Their overall supply 
chain was challenged by inflexible architectures and the imminent labor 
shortages that came soon after. The Construction sector, which often includes 
a complex chain of contractors, engineers and skilled tradesmen, has long 
been a healthy target for cybercriminals scoring 70 overall in security culture. 
The interdependencies associated with this complex structure create even 
greater complications in the private exchange of information and currency.

The most favorable score for the Construction sector is Communication, a 
moderate 76, a one\-point decrease from last year. This shows that there 
is a reasonable approach to communicating with employees across their 
challenging structures. Organizations need to pay close attention to the kinds 
of messaging being directed at each audience and the mediums through 
which they communicate. This is a rich environment where cybercriminals 
thrive. Targeted communications focusing on the unique, security\-related 
threats, issues and responsibilities for each role will help.

Areas for Improvement
The most significant area for improvement within the Construction sector continues 
to be Cognition. The score of 66 in this dimension, a one\-point decrease from 
last year, while considered moderate, indicates large gaps in understanding and 
ownership. A lack of relevant and engaging security awareness training will hinder 
their ability to become more secure and to evolve their security culture. Many work 
environments in this industry are not conducive to a traditional computer\-based 
training approach because much of the workforce is widely dispersed on job sites 
without access to computers and/or centrally managed, handheld devices. This 
puts an onus on the employees to complete necessary training on their own time 
or for organizations to slow production to complete training, not a viable option.

76

The Construction sector is also struggling in the dimensions of Norms at 
68, unchanged from last year and Responsibilities at 68, a one\-point 
decrease from last year. Without appropriate mechanisms to deliver necessary 
security training content, policies and standards, 
employees are less likely to take ownership of 
their personal obligation to do their part for 
the protection of the organization. Employees 
may mistake unacceptable security\-related 
behaviors as acceptable because there is a lack 
of understanding of what proper conduct looks 
like. The Construction industry needs to make time 
to raise employees’ levels of readiness to detect 
cyber attacks in order to not fall victim to one.

Consulting
The Consulting sector, with an overall security culture score of 75, remains 
a very attractive high\-profile target for cybercriminals. They are data rich, 
ranging from intellectual property, financial information, to strategic planning, 
growth strategies and gap analysis studies. Clients expect elevated levels 
of confidentiality, which may prove challenging with the high\-paced and 
stressful environment generally bred in this sector. In the era of COVID\-19, 
this sector is likely to see a great deal of disruption in managing current 
projects and locking in new ones. Specifically, consulting engagements 
that require onsite collaboration are impacted. This sector will need to find 
ways to work more efficiently, effectively and securely through different 
client mediums, while keeping the collaborative spirit alive.

Employees of these organizations demand ready access to information 
when they need it. But they face a balancing act between providing that 
access through reliable and secure means to minimize exposure to possible 
threats versus allowing company data to be shared in an open trough 
for all employees to feed from. The ability to use communication tools 
and mediums effectively and efficiently can be the determining factor in 
preparing the workforce to detect and prevent attacks.

Consulting firms continue to show very positive trends towards becoming more 
secure through Attitudes at 78, unchanged from last year and Communication 
at 80, a one\-point increase from last year, both on the higher end. With 
Communication being a cornerstone in the Consulting sector, it is likely that 
employees understand their respective roles and responsibilities and will 
readily make appropriate adjustments to adopt more favorable security 
practices. Additionally, their moderately high score in the Communication 
dimension, will benefit them during these challenging times.

Areas for Improvement
With a Cognition score of 73, a one\-point increase from last year, it is likely 
that employees possess an adequate understanding of what their roles and 
responsibilities are regarding driving a more secure culture. Therefore, security 
awareness content, delivered in a continuous and relevant manner, is paramount 
to conveying the required information. Additionally, 
the score of 71 for Norms, a one\-point decrease 
from last year, is moderately low, revealing that 
Consulting firms need to continue to use their 
Communications strengths to define and share 
these unwritten rules. “The task of building a 
security culture is thus to stimulate development 
of norms that support organizational security 
and ensure these norms become internalized.”\[1]

Consumer Services
Organizations in the Consumer Services sector typically offer support\-based 
products that are not physical in nature, making for an interesting mix in overall 
measurement of descriptive statistics. The Consumer Services sector, with an 
overall security culture score of 72, has long been challenged with keeping 
up with technological advances that would help to reinforce their security 
infrastructures; add the global COVID\-19 pandemic to the mix, and those 
deficiencies are magnified. Trying to manage the physical and cyber safety 
of their employees and customers, coupled with managing a workforce that 
may now be remote, will prove to be a significant test of their ability to re\-
examine and adapt to new ways of doing business. 

With moderately high scores in the Communication dimension at 77, a one\-point 
increase from last year, we understand that Consumer Services organizations can 
use communications internally to positively shift the attitudes of their employees 
and externally to drive trust and confidence through their customer base. 
Although the Attitude dimension at a 74, was down two points from last year, 
we know “behavioral security research shows that attitudes are an important 
predictor of end\-user behaviors and can at the same time be influenced by 
various mechanisms” (Source: The 7 Dimensions of Security Culture).

Areas for Improvement
The dimension of Cognition had a moderate score of 69, unchanged from last 
year. With a more dispersed pool of talent, Consumer Services organizations 
are challenged to ensure that there is consistent security understanding 
across their employees, especially in a more prominent work\-from\-home 
(WFH) environment. Questions on whether the ability of currently leveraged 
technology is able to support growing WFH populations are paramount. As 
WFH communities are expanded, security protocols need to be adjusted 
and a re\-evaluation of employee readiness needs to be tested. 

Two additional dimensions that reflected low moderate scores of 69 
were Norms and Responsibilities, both down two points from last year. 
Consumer Services sector organizations are struggling to establish solid 
norms due to their diverse and even more 
disconnected talent pool. If employees struggle 
with internalizing the unwritten rules, then their 
ability to connect those rules to what they are 
personally responsible for in driving a stronger, 
more defined security culture may be blurred. 
And as employees are spending less time in the 
workplace, it is more challenging to reinforce.

Education
The Education sector has had an especially difficult time due to the 
COVID\-19 pandemic. In addition to the ongoing challenges of a broad 
variety of institutions (public, private and higher education), the sudden 
transition of most schools to online or hybrid teaching environments, a shift 
in “tools of the trade” and an emphasis on remote learning has created a 
seismic shift in the industry. Despite most institutions facing issues related 
to limited funding, there is a commendable slight upturn this year in every 
dimension within the Education sector. The improved security culture score 
of 70, a two\-point increase from last year, falls in the moderate range. 

The Education sector continues to indicate a moderate, though slightly 
improved, attitude toward security. Every dimension indicates an improvement 
ranging from one to three points. The dimensions of Attitudes, Cognition, 
Communication, Norms and Responsibilities have increased one point 
while Compliance and Behaviors have increased by two and three points, 
respectively. This broad scope of incremental improvement can be attributed 
to the dramatic shift in work culture and norms associated with the move to 
online and hybrid learning environments, motivating the industry at large 
to pay particular attention to security behaviors.

Areas for Improvement
Last year’s assessment found Education in last place ranking in each of 
our industry comparisons. The broad improvements in security culture 
are laudatory and these improvements are steps in the right direction for 
the Education industry. Educational institutions at all levels, but primarily 
K\-12, will need to determine if abbreviated school days, networks that 
are potentially not secure and at home distractions play a role in security 
risk on a broader level. Continued focus on all dimensions will help 
increase their overall security culture, particularly as remote 
and hybrid school environments will remain in place 

for the foreseeable future.

Energy \& Utilities
The Energy \& Utilities sector relies upon a series of unique interdependencies 
between their physical and cyber infrastructures, making companies more 
potentially vulnerable to exploitation by foreign intelligence services and 
cybercriminals. Entities such as the U.S. federal government’s Cybersecurity 
Risk Information Sharing Program (CRISP), help provide situational 
awareness and information sharing in a public\-private partnership, enable 
this sector access to training and materials to identify and address the 
severity of security risks. Although many such organizations are available 
to support training and awareness, their industry survey remains steadfast 
at a moderate security culture score of 71\.

Five of seven dimensions measured showed incremental improvements, 
most notably Behaviors (71\) and Compliance (72\), which both increased, 
indicating that employees are better informed of the impact of their behaviors 
on overall security culture as well as how to adhere to their industry’s 
compliance policies. Cognition (67\), Norms (69\) and Responsibilities (70\) 
all increased by one point. These three dimensions are the lowest rated of 
the seven dimensions and though improvements are evident, additional 
emphasis in the industry’s security programs would benefit any organization.

Areas for Improvement
As with the overall score, two dimensions also remain consistent—Attitudes 
(74\) and Communications (76\). All remaining dimensions show incremental 
improvements. With these steadfast scores, it is apparent that both dimensions 
can improve both their willingness to implement and maintain security 
practices as well as how the industry provides pertinent information to 
their employees.

The Energy \& Utilities sector needs to adopt an ultra\-diligent focus on ensuring 
their employees are able to spot an attack and report it. In KnowBe4’s 
Phishing by Industry 2021 Benchmark Report (not yet published), we 
found that this sector had the highest Phish\-Prone™ percentage, employee 
susceptibility to phishing attacks, in mid\-size organizations (250\-1,000 
employees) at both 90 days and one year 
after training. It is not enough to just provide 
training. Employees need to be continuously 
given opportunities to test their knowledge and 
learn what to look for should they misstep. A 
more continuous approach of learning and 
testing would serve this sector well.

Financial Services
The Financial Services sector is no stranger to risk mitigation practices. 
When someone controls, trades and governs significant amounts of 
money, all while housing highly confidential financial and personal client 
information, it is a given that they would be at the top of a cyber criminal’s 
target list. And, as many companies in the sector move to a more remote 
work environment, the safety of normal business functions is under a great 
deal of scrutiny. These organizations may not be able to minimize the 
number of cyber attacks launched against them, but they can minimize 
their likelihood of falling victim to one of those attacks; and they seek to do 
so by adopting a robust, multi\-layered defensive strategy and immersing 
their employees in comprehensive and continuous security awareness 
training. As a result, their overall security culture score is a moderate 76\.

For a second year, the Communication dimension for Financial Services 
organizations scored in the good category at 80\. Threats are quickly 
evolving in this sector. Pandemic\-related market volatility will also play a 
role in lessened customer engagement and lower confidence in investments.

Areas for Improvement
The Financial Services sector earned a moderate performance score of 72 
in the Cognition dimension, unchanged from last year. Employee error is 
one of the leading security issues facing Financial Services organizations. 
Consider that “if a person is not aware of basic concepts of information 
security, he or she is more prone to information security threats than 
others. Thus, knowledge is one of the key concepts in the research of 
human factor in information security, and it is a dominant component of 
information security awareness” (Source: The 7 Dimensions of Security 
Culture). Adding additional pressure is the threat of personal distraction 
in the home workplace. Cybercriminals are betting on less training, lower 
comprehension levels, and for employees to be distracted, not paying 
attention to what they are clicking on.

equal time needs to be invested in stimulating 
professional norms to help drive a stronger 
security culture and shared values.

Government
Federal, state and local governments possess broad degrees of experience 
managing risk on\-premise and an increasingly cloud\-based infrastructure. 
The federal government utilizes the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and, in addition, the 
Department of Defense recently released the Cybersecurity Maturity Model 
Certification (CMMC), which is a new certification procedure used to assess 
the cybersecurity environment of contracted (vendor) companies. These 
criteria range from Access Control and Security Awareness to System and 
Information Integrity. Despite these increased efforts, this sector earned 
only a moderate security culture score of 71\.

Four dimensions of security training remained consistent with last year’s scoring: 
Attitudes, Behaviors, Communication and Compliance. Communication 
towards security remained the highest score at 75, followed closely 
by Attitudes at 74 and both Behaviors and Compliance at 72\. These 
consistencies indicate moderate awareness of sanctioned communications 
resources and the need for situational and security awareness, as well 
as compliance as it relates to government policies (likely related to issues 
ranging from password integrity to clean desk policy).

Areas for Improvement
Government sector organizations continue to exhibit a questionable 
understanding of security and cybersecurity risks. Though a steady rating, 
the Compliance score of 72, unchanged from 2020, continues to indicate 
that employees are in need of additional training as it relates to compliance 
requirements throughout their sphere of responsibility. There is an ongoing 
opportunity for improvement in this area. 

Most concerning are the low scores of Cognition, Norms and Responsibilities. 
Cognition increased one point to 68, however this score is still unfortunately 
low, which indicates a heightened focus on security awareness training is 
needed as well as a better understanding of how their cyber hygiene affects 
government’s overall security posture. The highly publicized SolarWinds hack 
may serve to prompt government employees 
to keep in mind direct as well as supply chain 
security issues. Cognition’s score, combined 
with declines of Norms and Responsibilities at 
68, both one point decreases from last year, 
highlights the need for the Government workforce 
to better understand their organization’s unwritten 
rules and codes of conduct, the adoption of 
that conduct and their sense of ownership of 
securing their organization.

Healthcare \& Pharmaceuticals
Due to the sensitivities of personally identifiable information (PII) as well as 
legal requirements such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA) of 1996, the Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals sector has 
necessarily demonstrated a broad awareness of the need for security culture. 
The COVID\-19 pandemic has especially impacted how the industry functions, 
with the increased adoption of telehealth and remote patient monitoring. 

Bad actors, motivated by reasons ranging from financial to vaccine 
development\-related espionage, have pivoted their targeting efforts to the 
remote worker as employees increasingly accessed corporate networks 
with personal devices. This change combined with the industry’s deep 
understanding of risk management has produced mixed results for the 
Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals sector’s metrics.

The industry’s overall results remain consistent with last year’s moderate 
security culture score of 74 and also maintains its positive attitude toward 
security culture with a high moderate score of 78 in the Attitudes dimension, 
unchanged from last year. Also consistent with last year’s scores were 
Cognition (70\), Communication (77\) and Compliance (74\), which indicate 
employees’ ongoing awareness of their security role, their effective means 
of quickly and securely disseminating relevant information to employees 
as needed as well as industry\-specific policies.

Areas for Improvement
As with last year’s reporting, the Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals sector 
demonstrates some room for improvement on the Norms dimension which 
dropped one point to 71\. This dimension measures an organization’s security\-
related unwritten rules and acceptable behaviors, and how those are reflected 
in the actions and values of employees. Employee familiarity and aptitude are 
vital in the growth of any risk management and training program. Similarly, 
the Responsibilities dimension also dropped one point to 70\. This dimension 
measures an employee’s understanding of the safeguards they provide as 
those safeguards relate to their organization’s security posture.

As with last year, the Cognition score of 70, though 
consistent, provides another opportunity for 
potential improvement. The ongoing COVID\-19 
pandemic has brought not before seen advances 
(such as the speed to get vaccines FDA approved 
and ready for distribution), accompanied by 
serious challenges related to security, supply 
chain and logistics. Employees in this sector will 
need to be closely tuned into security issues and 
activities, and instinctively understand what to 
do not to fall victim.

Insurance
The Insurance sector is a tremendous target for cybercriminals due to the 
amount of personal, financial and medical information these organizations 
hold. They are also dealt regulatory fines if they do not adhere to or fall 
behind on their respective security protocols. In the COVID\-19 era, insurers 
are facing long\-term effects. Insurers are looking at potential general 
liability claims and claims filed against C\-level executives, for failure to 
protect their employees from contracting the virus and not providing a safe 
working environment. Additionally, insurers that cover travel and events are 
seeing a record number of cancellations, moving to more virtual conference 
environments, causing a significant swell of larger dollar claims. 

The Insurance sector with an overall security culture score of a moderate 
75, showed good attitudes toward Communication, which scored 80, a 
one\-point increase from last year. The need for strong, clear internal and 
external communications is paramount. Employees need to have accurate 
and timely information to respond to policyholders in order to promote 
assurance in their business transactions. They need to be able to convey 
a level of trust and confidence that keeps business intact. 

With a score of 79 in the dimension of Attitudes, a one\-point increase from 
last year, we see that employees within the Insurance sector have good 
feelings and beliefs related to the importance of their roles in security 
protocols and issues. A highly regulated industry, insurers need to make 
certain that they are meeting regulatory standards at every intersection.

Areas for Improvement
The Insurance sector earned low\-moderate performance in the dimension of 
Cognition at a 71, unchanged from 2020\. The Cognition dimension score 
indicates an immediate need for enhanced and continuous security awareness 
training that extends to every level of employee, from executives to the front 
line, to third\-party partners. Being highly regulated means that they meet 
federal regulations, not that they fully understand their role in better securing 
the organization as well as themselves. That, coupled with seeking higher levels 
of adoption for unwritten security rules, is likely 
to have a direct impact on the overall positive 
movement of these two critical areas.

77

80

72

Employee knowledge, interactive security 
content, as well as pervasive and continuous 
communications are all critical drivers to reinforce 
the importance to how security\-related behaviors 
are perceived by employees as normal and 
accepted or unusual and unacceptable.

Legal
Legal is largely impacted by the COVID\-19 pandemic. Many legal 
services switched to remote work and as a result, the established norms of 
transactional work as well as dispute resolution had to adapt to this new 
form of engagement. Cybersecurity and privacy lawyers appear to be in 
greater demand due to the increase in cyber attacks. Legal practices that 
facilitate the collection and protection of data have thrived.

A well\-organized sector, many collaborations formed to quickly address 
the threat of bad actors regarding the large amounts of sensitive client 
data and financial transactions. The benefit from these collaborations is 
reflected in the overall increases in security culture that finds Legal at 73, 
up two points over last year. 

All but one dimension saw improvement over last year’s ratings. Legal firms 
are overwhelmingly positive towards Norms, which increased a substantial 
four points to 71 this year. Attitudes and Responsibilities both increased 
by two, now rating at 76 and 71\.

Areas for Improvement
With the Behavior dimension scoring 69, a one\-point decrease from last 
year, it is clear that more focus should be placed on conduct and adaptation 
to new remote environmental norms. And despite great improvement in both 
Norms (71\) and Responsibilities (71\) there is much room for improvement. 
As with last year’s findings, it is important to note the correlation between 
Behaviors and Norms; an increased focus on reinforcing Norms to drive 
desired Behaviors, particularly in the current remote work environment, 
is recommended.

Manufacturing
As with most sectors, COVID\-19 has changed how manufacturers conduct 
their business. The pandemic created the greatest disruption to manufacturing 
since the second World War. Many employees began work from home 
and bad actors are targeting companies now more vulnerable due to 
the worldwide disruption of supply chain materials; this is causing the 
Manufacturing sector’s journey towards digital transformation for supply 
chain, globalization and increased connectivity of manufacturing platforms 
to slow. These rapidly evolving factors contribute to the Manufacturing 
sector, again receiving a moderate security culture score of 71\.

The Manufacturing sector experienced a slight increase in the Compliance 
dimension from 70 to 71, possibly due to renewed policy awareness as 
a result of global supply chain disruption. Unfortunately, this success is 
offset by the sector’s steady ratings in three dimensions (Cognition (67\), 
Communication (76\), Norms (69\)) and, significantly, the loss of one point 
in three other dimensions (Attitude (74\), Behavior (71\), Responsibility (70\)).

The Communication dimension remains consistent (76\) and with one of 
the highest scores of this dimension in any industry, clearly demonstrating 
their information avenues are available and utilized by its employee base. 

Both the Norms and Cognition dimensions remain in place. The Norms 
dimension measured at 69, indicates the unwritten rules and how they are 
being adopted by the employees and at 67, the Cognition dimension is a 
clear indicator that despite the consistent score, the Manufacturing sector 
has more work to do regarding risk and threat awareness.

Areas for Improvement
The sector’s slight dip in the Attitudes dimension from 75 to 74 indicates a 
slight decline in employees’ willingness to adopt security practices in keeping 
with this sector’s evolution as it confronts pandemic\-related challenges.

The Behaviors dimension looks at how employees behave regarding 
security, and this dimension has lost one point, now at 71\. Similarly, the 
Responsibility dimension decreased one point 
last year, now at 70\.

The Manufacturing sector is one of the most 
besieged and vulnerable to phishing attacks; 
as such, improvement in Attitudes, Behaviors 
and Responsibilities, in addition to bolstering 
other vulnerable areas via improved training 
and education programs will better defend 
against ongoing cyber threats.

Not for Profit
Cybercriminals continue to target Not for Profit organizations, knowing that 
they generally have very lean operating budgets and can sometimes justify 
only a small investment back into operations. As a result, cybersecurity is 
often neglected. In a time of unprecedented unemployment, the growing 
need for food banks and ongoing government\-funded relief efforts, they 
are part of the critical infrastructure and as a result, ripe for a cyber attack. 
Many Not for Profits exist on the fringe of what is considered a small business 
and do not believe they are big, important or relevant enough to provide 
a big payday. But times are very different now, and their bounty has gone 
up. With an overall security culture score of 72, Not for Profits depend 
heavily on their favorable brands, strong reputations and word\-of\-mouth 
marketing to drive dollars, volunteers and interest toward their causes. 

For the second year, Not for Profits scored best in the dimension of 
Communication (78—unchanged from 2020\), showing strong attitudes 
toward the act of communicating. This makes sense, since communicating 
is where they invest a lot of time and money to draw interest. Since 
communicating is a critical component of building a strong security culture, 
it is important that Not for Profits cascade the right security information 
to the right audiences at the right time, both internal and external, raising 
donor long\-term trust and confidence.

Areas for Improvement
Most of the dimensions for Not for Profits fell in the moderate scoring range, 
with Cognition and Norms at 69, a one\-point decrease in Norms at the 
lower half of this range. With less to invest that is deemed non\-essential 
and while focused on the primary goal of pursuing the organization’s 
objectives while keeping the doors open, Not for Profits tend not to rank 
security training as a top priority. Therefore, personnel and volunteers 
have varied levels of knowledge of security best practices.

A lack of overall security knowledge results 
in the low adoption rate of critical, unwritten 
security rules, which will impact overall secure 
behaviors and lead to operating under a less 
secure culture. Not for Profits would benefit 
in leveraging low cost or free security tools 
that are developed for their specific needs. 
That way, investment in the form of dollars is 
less of an obstacle, and they can focus their 
time and energy on enrollment, engagement 
and adoption of relevant messaging for their 
varied audiences.

Other
The Other sector, with an overall security culture score of 73, represents 
industries that did not fit into the named industry sectors, or in which the 
data available in a named sector was less than 10 organizations.

Across this grouping, Communication scored moderate with a 77, a one\-
point increase from last year. While Attitudes also scored in the moderate 
range with a score of 76, a one\-point increase from last year. With moderate 
scores in both Communication and Attitudes, it is likely that employees are 
open to making necessary adjustments to adopt more secure practices. 
Additionally, their Communication score demonstrates that they are working 
to have effective channels for the creation and dissemination of messaging 
to their respective audiences across different areas.

Areas for Improvement
The Other sector is showing a moderate score of 70 in Cognition, a 
two\-point increase from last year. The Cognition score shows that there is 
a strong need for more frequent, comprehensive and engaging security 
awareness training programs. With such diverse groups of industries, 
representing a diversity of employee backgrounds with equally diverse 
skill sets and degrees of security knowledge, the Other sector’s ability to 
find and assign appropriately targeted, relevant security content to meet 
the needs of their diverse audience is critical for success. Additionally, 
access to multiple mediums for training delivery will help to bring training 
content to the individuals so that they can consume it when they have time 
instead of forcing them into a more traditional training cycle.

In the dimension of Norms, the Other sector should be evaluating how their 
employees are influenced and guided by their organization’s unwritten 
rules. As a key overall influencer, Norms can be leveraged to 
drive more awareness to security behaviors across the 
employee base to strengthen the security culture.

Retail and Wholesale
The Retail and Wholesale sector has traditionally been a favored target 
among cybercriminals. The challenge is, as always, finding a balance 
between fulfilling the needs of customers while increasing their overall 
security posture. In a time where consumers are looking for greater 
convenience and safety in their shopping options, online sales are growing 
while traditional storefronts are struggling. Also, if entities were struggling 
pre\-COVID\-19, the likelihood of them faltering increases because with 
higher levels of unemployment, spending that may have gone towards 
“extras”, is now straining to put food on the table in many households. 
Consumers are also looking at discount options to fulfill what they need. 
Instead of shopping at well\-established and trusted retailers, they will often 
select the discount retailer to maximize their spend. 

The Retail and Wholesale sector, with an overall security culture score of 
71 indicates a moderately low attitude toward security. With a moderate 
score of 74 in the Attitudes dimension, a one\-point decrease from last 
year, it is likely that employees in this sector are positive toward making 
adjustments and adopting security best practices. Further, communication 
is the strongest aspect of Retail and Wholesale security culture, with a 
Communication dimension at 76, unchanged from 2020\. This industry is 
finding ways to disseminate relevant security\-related content across their 
diverse audience in a way that is meaningful and useful. The approach 
here is not one size fits all, but rather looking at each job function and 
determining what would be most helpful and actionable for those roles.

Areas for Improvement
The Retail and Wholesale sector has opportunities for improvement on the 
Norms dimension with a score of 69, unchanged from 2020\. This dimension 
is measuring the unwritten rules and how employees are adopting them. 
Although job\-related training may be more individualized by role, every 
employee needs to understand and adopt those common sense, unwritten 
security\-related rules.

The Cognition dimension is another area 
where the Retail and Wholesale sector can 
improve. With a score of 67, unchanged from 
2020, the lowest rated dimension in this sector, 
there is a clear need for improved training 
and education programs. There is a strong 
connection between Cognition and Norms, and 
the Retail and Wholesale sector is likely to see 
direct improvement in overall security culture 
by emphasizing training in both dimensions.

Technology
Technology companies have dramatically shifted priorities to support 
pandemic\-related needs: business continuity, remote work and planning 
for transition to the “new normal”, which will likely include a large portion 
of their workforce maintaining a work from home status. This pivot included 
bolstering their remote workforce’s network security as well as training end 
users to identify new threats that bad actors pose by targeting the remote 
workforce. These adjustments are reflected in the Technology sector’s 
moderate security culture score of 75\.

Perhaps as a result of these shifts in priorities, the Technology sector has 
increased in five out of seven dimensions, most notably in Behaviors and 
Cognition, which both increased two points to 77 and 75, respectively. The 
highest dimension, as with last year, was in the Attitudes dimension, which 
increased one point to 79 this year. It is again clear that employees in this 
industry exhibit an understandable inclination towards making adjustments 
and adopting security practices.

Areas for Improvement
The Technology sector’s areas for improvement are minor with decreases 
in two dimensions, Norms (72\) and Responsibilities (73\). As mentioned 
previously in this assessment, the dramatic shift in the industry due to the 
pandemic is reflected in these scores, due to a rapid adjustment in what is 
the “new normal” and what employees’ new work from home responsibilities 
are in a work from home environment.

Transportation
The pandemic has amplified existing security culture likely due to increased 
dependencies upon Transportation as the population has increasingly 
leveraged online shopping and home delivery services. The potential 
long\-term result of a sustained move from storefront to online shopping 
will continue to drive the industry’s security evolution. Additionally, the 
global population was at a standstill. There were reductions in all forms of 
transportation, from air travel to road travel. This transformation is evident 
given the industry’s overall security culture improvements, to include 
an overall score that has increased one point over last year, but is still 
moderately low at 71\.

Transportation improved in five out of seven dimensions, most notably in 
the Compliance dimension, which improved two points over last year’s 
assessment. In addition, Attitudes, Behavior, Norms and Responsibilities 
are all up one point. With the industry increasingly dependent upon digital 
infrastructure, their security culture—particularly as it relates to cyber 
hygiene—is increasingly vital. This increased digital dependency increases 
their cyber attack surface, making users more at risk to social engineering.

Areas for Improvement
Specific opportunities for improvement can focus on both Cognition (which 
did not change from last year at 67\) and Communications, which fell one 
point to 74\. However, as with last year’s assessment, the Transportation 
sector can also benefit from a holistic approach on all dimensions 

to elevate this sector’s overall security culture.

Methodology and Data

This report was created by KnowBe4 Research. The report leverages anonymized data from 
KnowBe4’s Security Culture Survey. The sample size represents 2,093 surveyed organizations 
around the world, with more than 328,173 employees across 17 industry sectors, effectively making 
this the largest report of its kind published to date.

Below is a description of the methods used to analyze the data along with descriptive tables.

How Data Was Collected
The data for this report was collected using the Security Culture Survey, which is available to 
KnowBe4 customers via the Kevin Mitnick Security Awareness Training (KMSAT) platform. The 
Security Culture Survey was developed by CLTRe, a KnowBe4 company, based on a scientific 
approach that integrates survey methodology, statistics and scientific findings from security culture 
research and psychometrics. The survey consists of four items for each distinct dimension of security 
culture, a total of 28 items; and the question set and methodology have been refined over several 
years. The data collection period was from November 2019 through December 2020 and represents 
customers around the globe. The data for this report is based on a single data collection time point 
for each employee and was then anonymized and aggregated. All data analysis was performed 
in the software environment R (r\-project.org).

Data Preprocessing
To ensure validity and reliability, the data was cleaned before any calculations were conducted. 
Industry sectors with less than 10 organizations, or where industry sector information was not 
available, were moved to the Other industry category. The industries that were moved to Other 
included Hospitality and Internet and Software Services. A listwise deletion of missing data was 
conducted, which means that responses with missing values were deleted.

Furthermore, respondents who spent less than two minutes on the survey were 
excluded, as they would not have taken the time to read the questions before 
answering them. Organizations with less than 10 valid employee responses 
were excluded, as these were considered accounts for testing the survey 
and thus do not measure a representative proportion of the organization.

Statistical Analyses
The values that employees provide on the 28 security culture items 
are transformed into eight metrics for each organization. The first 
seven metrics correspond to each of the seven security culture 
dimensions. The final metric is the Security Culture Score, which 
is calculated by taking the mean of all the dimension scores. 
All scores have a range from zero to 100\.

38

The Security Culture Survey, and therefore this report, is created as a multi\-level statistical analytics 
tool, where individual respondents are aggregated to the level of an organization. One of the 
benefits of aggregating scores to an organization level rather than at the employee level, is that 
the effects of organization size on industry benchmarks were neutralized. The unique algorithm for 
this transformation was designed by CLTRe and based on a complex conceptual understanding of 
organizational security culture.

After statistical analysis, the scores were compared to the Security Culture Index. The Security Culture 
Index is the scale used to measure security culture, and consists of these five levels.
