Security Culture Report 2021

Executive Summary
Welcome to the 2021 Security Culture Report, the fourth annual report of its kind. The Security Culture
Report and associated methodology was originally developed by CLTRe, which was acquired by
KnowBe4 in 2019, and is KnowBe4 Research’s most ambitious report. The data represented here
was collected during the global COVID-19 pandemic and, as such, some findings from our research
reflect both positive and negative inflections that may be attributable to pandemic conditions.
Security culture is the ideas, customs
and social behaviors of an organization
that influence their security. Of 1,161
security leaders surveyed in 2020, 94%
reported[^1] that security culture is the
most important element in their security
strategy. This sentiment is reflected in the
growth in the number of organizations
measuring their security culture.
More than 320,000 employees, in
1,872 organizations around the world have been surveyed in this largest ever study of security
culture. While some industries saw security culture stagnate or decline during the pandemic, we
were encouraged to see a number of industries use the pandemic as an opportunity to improve.

[^1]: The Security Culture Report 2020

> More than 94% of security leaders
> around the world believe that
> security culture is critical.

Security culture is directly associated
with reduced risk. In a recently published
KnowBe4 Research report, we demonstrated
that organizations with poor security culture
have a risk that is 52 times higher for
employees sharing credentials.[^2] As of yet,
there are no industries that quantifiably
demonstrate a good security culture, which
is characterized by a score of 80 points
or more. This is worrying when we see a
continued growth in the threat level, and a growing number of victims of cybercrime. According to
CoveWare, 2020 saw ransomware payments reach an all-time high with organizations across all
industries being targeted. The most common method used by hackers to gain access to their target
systems is by social engineering.
In their Q4 2020 Ransomware Marketplace Report, the ransomware remediation and analytics firm
CoveWare noted that for the first time, phishing surpassed other techniques as the most common
tool[^3] used by hackers to gain access. As such, organizations around the world—large and small—
should expect to see an increase in phishing attacks in the coming years.
Security culture is a critical, need-to-have asset in the security toolbox. By assessing employees’ security
awareness, behaviors and culture, organizations can adapt their policies and training programs to the
constantly changing threat landscape. The alternative becomes less attractive by the hour: do nothing
and see your organization crumble to a halt by ransomware, data theft or business interruption.

Summary of Findings
2020 was heavily influenced by the global effects of COVID-19. And we believe that we see
pandemic-related ripples within some of the year-over-year changes detected in security culture.
This is a high-level summary of the findings:
Embracing Digital Transformation:
- The education industry improved by two points. This improvement may be explained by
education being moved from classrooms to virtual settings due to the COVID-19 pandemic
and the associated technology systems and training changes.
- The legal industry also increased their score by two points. Again, we may explain this
improvement by many legal processes and procedures being moved online.
Suffering from Chaos and Confusion:
On the other side of the spectrum, the news is not so good:
- The Consumer Services industry dropped one point lower this year. This may be due to the
reduction in the workforce during the pandemic.
- The Construction industry also scored one point lower than last year. Again, we believe this
may be explained by the reduction in workforce due to the pandemic.
- The Business Services also scored one point lower this year. This sector has traditionally shown
a high score, making this change somewhat surprising.
Results from this year’s report revealed a large gap between the best performers and the poor
performers. Unsurprisingly, the best performers were from Financial Services and Banking—industries
with a long tradition of managing risk. However, being a “best performer” doesn’t necessarily equate
to having performed at a desirable level, and these industries shouldn’t be too quick to congratulate
themselves. For instance, a score of 76, as seen by Banking and Financial Services, is well below a
Good security culture. Our research shows that moving from one security culture class to another is
directly correlated to risk. By improving from the current class of Moderate to the next class of Good
security culture, these industries will see a reduction by eight times of employees sharing credentials.[^4]
As in earlier reports, the Education industry is one of the worst performers, with a score of 70. Even
though Education is still at the bottom of the list, this industry has shown a significant improvement
compared to earlier years and is now demonstrating Moderate security culture. This improvement
helps reduce the risk of employees sharing credentials by three times.[^4]
Another industry that saw an improvement from last year is the Legal industry, with a new score of
73. This change may be explained by the pandemic forcing many legal and court operations online.
Even if some users seem to struggle with the technology[^5], the adoption of technology is showing
an improved security culture too.

Sharing the bottom placement with the Education sector is the Construction industry. Unlike the
Education industry, Construction experienced a drop in their security culture during the pandemic.
Other industries with a reduction in security culture are the Consumer Services industry, with a new
score of 72, and Business Services, with a new score of 74.
In this year’s report, we present a deep dive into security culture with the new report section, A
Detailed Analysis of Security Culture. This section provides an in-depth view to the state of specific
aspects of security culture. We look at how employees consider their sentiments about having access
to security-related information, how they think about passwords and their access to the security team.

![Distribution of Organizations According to Their Security Culture Score]

The mean and median of the total security culture score is 73. Detailed analysis shows that the
majority of all analyzed organizations managed to develop a mediocre or moderate security
culture, while only a small portion of organizations have a good security culture. Alarmingly, a
few organizations are scoring in the Poor bracket and no organizations have reached an Excellent
security culture score yet.

What Is Security Culture
Security culture is the ideas, customs and social behaviors that impact an organization’s security.
In information security culture, we look at how the cultural aspects influence the information
management. In cybersecurity culture, the focus is on the part of information management that uses
cyber technology to create, manipulate or store information and data.
The purpose of the security culture survey
and the Security Culture Report is to provide
an objective scientific method for assessing,
reporting and comparing the relative
information security culture‑related strengths
and weaknesses of individuals, organizations,
industry sectors, regions and more.

Security Culture Dimensions
We systematically evaluate culture across seven distinct dimensions; they are:
Attitudes
The feelings and beliefs that employees have
toward the security protocols and issues.
Behaviors
The actions and activities of employees that
have direct or indirect impact on the security
of the organization.
Cognition
Employees’ understanding, knowledge and
awareness of security issues and activities.
Communication
The quality of communication channels to
discuss security-related topics, promote a
sense of belonging and provide support for
security issues and incident reporting.
Compliance
The knowledge of written security policies and
the extent that employees follow them.
Norms
The knowledge of and adherence to unwritten
rules of conduct in the organization.
Responsibilities
How employees perceive their role as a
critical factor in sustaining or endangering
the security of the organization.

> Security culture: The ideas,
> customs and social behaviors of
> an organization that influence
> their security.

Security Culture Index
The Security Culture Index is the scale used to measure security culture. Each of the Security Culture
Dimensions are given a score, and then the total for all the dimensions is calculated. The mean of
the total is the Security Culture Score, which is used to compare each industry and organization
against the Security Culture Scale:
Poor
Mediocre
Moderate
Good
Excellent
0 up to 60
60 up to 70
70 up to 80
80 up to 90
90 up to 100

The Security Culture Disconnect
In the 2020 Security Culture Report, we reported a security culture disconnect globally. A large
majority of security leaders worldwide reported that security culture is crucial for their security
program. We showed that business principles are the main motivation for building a strong security
culture. Building business success (49%), business integrity (43%) and a sense of customer security
(41%) were security leaders’ top motivations for creating a strong security culture. However, we also
reported that the same security leaders miss a common definition of security culture. This inability
to define security culture leads to an over-confidence for organizations’ security cultures. In
our report this year, we demonstrate that the overconfidence is shown clearly in how
organizations earn security culture scores: not one single industry earned a score of
Good security culture.
This lack of understanding security culture introduces a number of challenges
for organizations’ abilities to build and maintain security cultures.
We define security culture as the ideas, customs and social behaviors
of an organization that influence their security. To work with security
culture, we must first understand it. It should be clear that to measure
and manage culture, we need to apply other tools, techniques and
practices than traditional security controls. The Verizon DBIR 2020
identifies phishing as the most common threat action. Research by
KnowBe4 clearly demonstrates the value of assessing the phish-
proneness of an organization and using that data to tailor training
and education to each employee’s need.
Furthermore, data from KnowBe4 Research shows the immediate role
of security culture in lowering employee-induced risks in organizations.
See our research paper Security Culture and Credential Sharing, 2021
as an example; in this report, we demonstrate a direct link between the
quality of a security culture and the number of employees sharing credentials
in a phishing assessment.

A Detailed Analysis of
Security Culture
How Security Culture Is Manifested in Organizations
In this section, we analyzed data from over 200,000 employees
across the world to see how they feel about the information security
in their organization. One of the things we are interested in is to learn
what a Poor security culture looks like. Why? As mentioned previously,
data show that there are great gains to be had by organizations
to improve their security culture. For example, organizations with
a Poor culture are 52 times more likely to share credentials than
those with a Good security culture.[^6] By examining how employees
report on specific topics, we can help their organization to improve
security culture by focusing their efforts where it matters most.
Specifically, we looked at how employees report their sentiments
about having access to security-related information, how they think
about passwords and their access to the security team.

Employees’ Perceived Need
for Training
Our analysis shows that one in five employees do not feel like they
receive enough security information. The potential consequences of
this are many. For instance, lack of information could be related to
poor understanding of when employees need to report incidents and
adhere to security standards. Providing information to employees
is a fundamental building block for security behaviors. Given the
many tools, resources and strategies created to tackle this specific
issue, it is surprising that more organizations are not succeeding in
this area. Organizations can leverage online training and ramp up
internal employee engagement campaigns to address this issue,
giving every employee access to the security information they need.
Our analysis shows that 57% of employees believe that they
would recognize if their device got hacked. This is alarming, given that many cybersecurity threats,
including ransomware like Ryuk, can go undetected for months before detection by even the best
organizations.[^7] Employee misperceptions are often consequences of organizations failing to
properly train their employees. A proactive security awareness training program and continuous
effort to improve security culture will help employees to recognize and address their blind spots.

Employees’ Understanding of Password Hygiene
The training of employees also impacts their understanding of why passwords are important. Our
industry’s fast changing rules of what good password hygiene is complicates matters with password
understanding. Over the past 30 years, security experts have trained employees to do contradictory
things—from change their passwords every 30 days, to no need to change passwords unless they
are in a breach; from limiting the number of characters (which
interestingly, some services still seem to be doing) to having a
minimum number of characters; from using only numbers or letters,
to enforcing all kinds of numbers, symbols, letters and cases. It is no
wonder why employees find it difficult to know what the rules are.
Leaked, breached, shared or cracked passwords are still one of
the most important methods for gaining illicit access to computer
systems. Criminals have upped their game on social engineering
and use a number of different strategies to gain access to what they
ultimately want: your money. Earlier, we mentioned ransomware;
another big hitter, Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks, have
nearly doubled over the past year according to the Spear Phishing
Report 5 from Barracuda.[^8]
Our research shows that there is a large gap between what
organizations teach, and what their employees internalize when
it comes to password hygiene. In our analysis, we see that 24% of
employees think that short and simple passwords do not increase
the risk of an attack on the organization.
This indicates that employees need more training to understand how
weak passwords are a risk to both themselves and their employer.
Twelve percent report that they do not understand why it is necessary
to change their passwords if only they know it.
In 2020, we continued to see a large amount of data breaches
resulting in leaked credentials according to Statista.[^9] KnowBe4
data shows that one in four employees reuse their passwords across
different services.[^10] If your employees do not understand the risk
associated with bad password hygiene or the need to change
stolen passwords, then training in this area is urgently needed to
reduce risk.

Research by LastPass in 2019[^11] claims that at large enterprises, employees have an average of
25 unique logins, and small businesses may have up to 80 unique logins. The number of unique
services and logins are likely to be similar, even for the majority of organizations that are not using
any password management solution. In our research, we found that 77% of the employees do
not use any means to securely store their passwords. The fact that most employees are required to
have a large number of logins, while they are not able to save their passwords in a secure location,
suggests that most employees reuse passwords.

Employees’ Perception of IT
Support Availability
One of the most important security measures for organizations should
be to ensure all employees know what to do and who to contact
in the case of a security incident. Our research shows that 30% of
employees report that it is difficult to reach the security experts in their
organization. When organizations fail to provide their employees
with adequate processes and access to the specialists, a higher
number of security breaches are to be expected.
The findings in this section serve as eye openers into how
employees around the world report the state of security culture
in their organizations. Organizations should take advantage of
the relationship between security culture and risk by focusing
their efforts on measuring and managing their security culture to
ensure they keep improving. We recommend using a standard
metric and a de facto benchmark to make it easier to know
where your security culture currently stands.

Industry Benchmark
In this section, we describe the security culture scores of each industry sector
in detail. Use this section to get a deep dive into specific industries, and as a
benchmark to compare your own scores against those of different industry sectors.

Benchmark Overview
Security culture varies across industries. In the industry comparison section, we
compare all industries according to their security culture scores. We also compare
the industries across each of the seven dimensions of security culture.
On these pages, we compare all the industries. This overview provides direct
insights into the difference across the industry sectors and it is created to make it
easy to understand how your industry compares to the other industries. You can
also use this section to compare your organization score with other industry sectors.

How to Read the Industry Benchmark Page
Each industry sector has its own benchmark. This benchmark includes a description, data points
and graphs. Each page is constructed in the same way, with a title, a description, a section on what
and how to improve, an overview infographic, a box plot and a column graph. Together, these
elements provide a wealth of information, presented in a way to make it easily accessible for any
reader. Use the page for your industry to inform yourself, your team and your board of directors on
the current state of your industry.
The report uses the Security Culture Index.
The security culture index is the scale used
to understand the security culture score.
The scale ranges from 0 (worse) to 100 (best)
and uses five levels that explain the quality of
the security culture.

The security culture index levels are:
Excellent
90 up to 100
Good
80 up to 90
Moderate
70 up to 80
Mediocre
60 up to 70
Poor
0 up to 60

How to Read the
Column Chart
Column charts use columns to compare
data. In this report, they are used to
compare the seven dimensions of security
culture. The height of the bar indicates
the score on the dimension. This makes it
easy to compare the scores on different
dimensions to see where the industry
scored the highest, lowest and possibly
equally. The bar chart also contains
a horizontal line, which indicates the
security culture score for the industry.
Comparing each column to the line
is useful in order to understand the
industry´s strong and weak areas.

How to Read the Box Plot
A box plot is a visual representation of important statistics
about the data. The box plot is used to easily understand how
the data samples are represented across the scale being used.
The security culture index uses a scale from 0 to 100, and the
box plot visualizes where each organization’s security culture
score falls within that range.
The line across the center of the plot is the median, which is
the middle score of all the scores when they are sorted. The
median is enclosed by a box; the start and end point of the box
indicates the range within which the middle 50% of all scores
fall. There are two lines sticking out from the box. The bottom
line indicates where the lower 25% of the scores fall, and the
upper line indicates where the top 25% of the scores fall. You
might also see some circles on the plot, often referred to as
outliers. These scores are very different from the others.

Banking
Due to the high value of financial data, the Banking sector has long been
familiar with risk management concepts. This, often coupled with government-
required cybersecurity and employee training standards, drives this industry’s
overall risk management strategy. The Banking sector’s security culture score
of 76 is consistent with last year’s report.
Employee survey results from this sector are also generally consistent with last
year, with only minor shifts in some dimensions. With a score of 79 in the Attitudes
dimension, a one-point decrease over last year, could be the result of a slight
shift in thinking, as the industry grapples with the effects of COVID-19 on day-
to-day work, with personnel working in shifts with less face-to-face interaction.
As with the previous year, both the Communication and Compliance
dimensions maintained their score of 79. The Banking industry maintains
strong communications channels, which serve to enable their employees
and an ongoing adherence to industry-specific policies, both of which
are vital to security culture. Customers, employees and regulators alike
will need specific crisis communication strategies providing assurance that
their risk management approach is solid, the financial institution remains
secure and that they can continue business without downsizing.
Also consistent with last year’s findings are the security Behaviors of Banking
industry employees. At 78, the Behaviors dimension reflects this industry’s
consistent security-based Behaviors. In order to maintain this favorable score,
employees will need to anticipate attacks and instinctively understand how to
navigate and report them. This will only happen through continuous training and
the use of simulated phishing attacks to keep strengthening the security muscle.

Areas for Improvement
Moderate scores of 73 in Norms, a one-point increase over last year, a
73 in Responsibilities, also a one-point increase and another 72 in the
Cognition dimension, unchanged, provide clear areas of improvement for
training and education programs.
Although an improvement of the Norms
dimension, which measures the unwritten
rules related to security expectations and how
employees are adopting them, is a welcome
improvement, there is little overall shift in the
industry’s overall benchmarks. The Banking
industry’s employees are well accustomed to
security training and will likely be highly receptive
to a greater emphasis on their responsibilities
towards and accounting for security norms.

![Banking Column Chart]

Business Services
Organizations within the Business Services sector typically offer assistance
in areas such as office administration, physical security, garbage disposal,
cleaning services and hiring and placing personnel. This sector houses a
large variety of organizations offering differing services, making for an
interesting mix in overall measurement of descriptive statistics. Historically,
this sector has been prone to a high percentage of targeted phishing
attacks. Across small, medium and large Business Services organizations,
there continues to be a high rate of susceptibility to being compromised,
leading to a higher risk level.
The Business Services sector continues to show a favorably healthy attitude
toward security and a willingness to take appropriate measures to better
secure their organizations and raise the readiness of their employees, with
an overall score of 74. A score of 77 in the Attitudes dimension, a one-point
decrease over last year, shows that employees continue to demonstrate a
moderate eagerness to be compliant with security measures. Additionally,
a good Communication dimension score of 79, also a one-point increase
over last year, shows that Business Services organizations are enthusiastic
to share security information early and often in their overall efforts to
connect with their user population. A consistent year-over-year moderate
Compliance score of 75, continues to indicate that Business Services
organizations are putting intentional focus on how they communicate,
disseminate and reinforce security policies.

Areas for Improvement
The Business Services industry has a few clear areas for improvement. With
a consistent Cognition score of 72 over last year, we see that although
employees demonstrate an eagerness to be compliant with security measures
as indicated above, the industry needs to adopt a higher commitment to
provide meaningful and ongoing security awareness training for all employees.
We continue to see more moderate scores of 71 in Norms and 72 in
Responsibilities, both unchanged. A strong commitment to comprehensive
and continuous training and education will
favorably impact these scores. Increased
training and awareness, coupled with the
already-good communications demonstrated
in this industry, will help strengthen employee
understanding and buy-in for security-related
behaviors and values. Creating a “security
champion” (aka culture carrier) program can
also be helpful here.

![Business Services Infographic]
![Business Services Box Plot]
![Business Services Column Chart]

Construction
The Construction sector was impacted early by their inability to secure
basic materials because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their overall supply
chain was challenged by inflexible architectures and the imminent labor
shortages that came soon after. The Construction sector, which often includes
a complex chain of contractors, engineers and skilled tradesmen, has long
been a healthy target for cybercriminals scoring 70 overall in security culture.
The interdependencies associated with this complex structure create even
greater complications in the private exchange of information and currency.
The most favorable score for the Construction sector is Communication, a
moderate 76, a one-point decrease from last year. This shows that there
is a reasonable approach to communicating with employees across their
challenging structures. Organizations need to pay close attention to the kinds
of messaging being directed at each audience and the mediums through
which they communicate. This is a rich environment where cybercriminals
thrive. Targeted communications focusing on the unique, security-related
threats, issues and responsibilities for each role will help.

Areas for Improvement
The most significant area for improvement within the Construction sector continues
to be Cognition. The score of 66 in this dimension, a one-point decrease from
last year, while considered moderate, indicates large gaps in understanding and
ownership. A lack of relevant and engaging security awareness training will hinder
their ability to become more secure and to evolve their security culture. Many work
environments in this industry are not conducive to a traditional computer-based
training approach because much of the workforce is widely dispersed on job sites
without access to computers and/or centrally managed, handheld devices. This
puts an onus on the employees to complete necessary training on their own time
or for organizations to slow production to complete training, not a viable option.
The Construction sector is also struggling in the dimensions of Norms at
68, unchanged from last year and Responsibilities at 68, a one-point
decrease from last year. Without appropriate mechanisms to deliver necessary
security training content, policies and standards,
employees are less likely to take ownership of
their personal obligation to do their part for
the protection of the organization. Employees
may mistake unacceptable security-related
behaviors as acceptable because there is a lack
of understanding of what proper conduct looks
like. The Construction industry needs to make time
to raise employees’ levels of readiness to detect
cyber attacks in order to not fall victim to one.

![Construction Column Chart]

Consulting
The Consulting sector, with an overall security culture score of 75, remains
a very attractive high-profile target for cybercriminals. They are data rich,
ranging from intellectual property, financial information, to strategic planning,
growth strategies and gap analysis studies. Clients expect elevated levels
of confidentiality, which may prove challenging with the high-paced and
stressful environment generally bred in this sector. In the era of COVID-19,
this sector is likely to see a great deal of disruption in managing current
projects and locking in new ones. Specifically, consulting engagements
that require onsite collaboration are impacted. This sector will need to find
ways to work more efficiently, effectively and securely through different
client mediums, while keeping the collaborative spirit alive.
Employees of these organizations demand ready access to information
when they need it. But they face a balancing act between providing that
access through reliable and secure means to minimize exposure to possible
threats versus allowing company data to be shared in an open trough
for all employees to feed from. The ability to use communication tools
and mediums effectively and efficiently can be the determining factor in
preparing the workforce to detect and prevent attacks.
Consulting firms continue to show very positive trends towards becoming more
secure through Attitudes at 78, unchanged from last year and Communication
at 80, a one-point increase from last year, both on the higher end. With
Communication being a cornerstone in the Consulting sector, it is likely that
employees understand their respective roles and responsibilities and will
readily make appropriate adjustments to adopt more favorable security
practices. Additionally, their moderately high score in the Communication
dimension, will benefit them during these challenging times.

Areas for Improvement
With a Cognition score of 73, a one-point increase from last year, it is likely
that employees possess an adequate understanding of what their roles and
responsibilities are regarding driving a more secure culture. Therefore, security
awareness content, delivered in a continuous and relevant manner, is paramount
to conveying the required information. Additionally,
the score of 71 for Norms, a one-point decrease
from last year, is moderately low, revealing that
Consulting firms need to continue to use their
Communications strengths to define and share
these unwritten rules. “The task of building a
security culture is thus to stimulate development
of norms that support organizational security
and ensure these norms become internalized.”[^1]

Consumer Services
Organizations in the Consumer Services sector typically offer support-based
products that are not physical in nature, making for an interesting mix in overall
measurement of descriptive statistics. The Consumer Services sector, with an
overall security culture score of 72, has long been challenged with keeping
up with technological advances that would help to reinforce their security
infrastructures; add the global COVID-19 pandemic to the mix, and those
deficiencies are magnified. Trying to manage the physical and cyber safety
of their employees and customers, coupled with managing a workforce that
may now be remote, will prove to be a significant test of their ability to re-
examine and adapt to new ways of doing business.
With moderately high scores in the Communication dimension at 77
, a one-point
increase from last year, we understand that Consumer Services organizations can
use communications internally to positively shift the attitudes of their employees
and externally to drive trust and confidence through their customer base.
Although the Attitude dimension at a 74, was down two points from last year,
we know “behavioral security research shows that attitudes are an important
predictor of end-user behaviors and can at the same time be influenced by
various mechanisms” (Source: The 7 Dimensions of Security Culture).

Areas for Improvement
The dimension of Cognition had a moderate score of 69, unchanged from last
year. With a more dispersed pool of talent, Consumer Services organizations
are challenged to ensure that there is consistent security understanding
across their employees, especially in a more prominent work-from-home
(WFH) environment. Questions on whether
