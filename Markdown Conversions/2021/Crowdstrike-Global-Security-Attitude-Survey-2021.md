Introduction

This report explores the attitude of security professionals focusing on many different areas, including:

• Why trust in legacy vendors, including Microsoft, continues to fall; the success rates of software 
supply chain attacks; and whether organizations are taking the necessary action to protect 
themselves against this vector 

• How effectively organizations are defending against ransomware; the costs that can be incurred if a 
ransomware attack is successful; and why ransomware costs are increasing at an alarming rate and 
why most times they include extortion fees 

• Why organizations are getting slower at detection, and how close organizations are at meeting 
CrowdStrike’s 1\-10\-60 benchmark for detecting, investigating and containing a cybersecurity 
incident

On the surface, the core aim of a cybersecurity professional is very simple: ensuring their organization 
is secure by keeping intruders out. But, in reality, there are so many moving parts – both internally and 
externally – that this objective has become increasingly difficult.

From an external perspective, the cyber threat landscape is always evolving, with well\-established attack 
vectors – such as ransomware and software supply chain attacks – becoming more sophisticated and 
persistent. In addition, cybercriminals continually improve their tradecraft, using increasingly sophisticated 
and stealthy techniques like fileless attacks to evade detection and breach the defenses of organizations. It 
is abundantly clear that cybersecurity teams have their backs against the wall when trying to defend against 
increasingly sophisticated and complex attacks. 

That’s only one side of the coin though. Internally IT teams are facing a completely different challenge – one 
that a couple of years ago nobody could have predicted. Naturally, COVID sent shockwaves around the 
globe in almost every industry. For those working in IT security, the increased attack surface stemming 
from the shift to remote and hybrid operating environments changed the way they must secure their 
organization. Today’s world is both remote\-first and digitally complex.

Security teams have been swimming upstream since long before the pandemic, though, due to factors 
such as limited resources and the industry’s well\-documented skills shortage. Most teams battle thousands 
of alerts a day and use outdated, legacy technology that is ineffective against today’s sophisticated 
cybercriminals. So, with these mitigating circumstances in mind, it’s easy to understand why there have 
been so many high\-profile breaches in recent years.

Taking all of these different elements working against organizations into account, clearly the time is now for 
security teams to take the necessary steps to reduce their chances of being the next victim of opportunistic 
cybercriminals and well\-equipped state\-sponsored adversaries. Transforming security infrastructure 
is imperative if businesses hope to avoid the financial and reputational harm caused by a successful 
cyberattack. The businesses that embrace cloud\-first, modern technologies such as endpoint detection 
and response (EDR), extended detection and response (XDR), Zero Trust, and human\-empowered 
managed threat hunting and intelligence will be the ones able to solve the fundamental challenges to thrive 
in the heightened threat environment. As adversaries advance their tradecraft to bypass legacy security 
solutions and exploit trusted technologies, the combination of world\-class technology combined with 
expert threat hunters is mandatory to detect and prevent today’s sophisticated threats.

63%

of respondents admit that their organization is 
losing trust in suppliers, such as Microsoft, 
due to frequent security incidents

Only 36%

have vetted all new and existing suppliers for 
security purposes in the last 12 months

84%

believe that software supply chain attacks 
could become one of the biggest cyber 
threats to organizations like theirs within the 
next three years

45%

of respondents’ organizations experienced at 
least one software supply chain attack in the 
last 12 months, compared to 32% in 2018

The average ransom payment increased by 63% in 2021 to $1\.79 million (USD), compared to $1\.10 
million (USD) in 2020\. CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed the average ransom demand from 
attackers is $6 million. While attackers aren’t getting quite the amounts they are seeking, they are still 
earning massive payouts. CrowdStrike attributes this to companies understanding both the threat and 
their exposure, and their ability to negotiate with attackers.

96%

of those who paid the initial ransom also had to 
pay extortion fees

66%

of respondents’ organizations suffered at least 
one ransomware attack in the past 12 months

57%

of those hit by ransomware didn’t have 
a comprehensive strategy in place to 
coordinate their response

On top of 
detection time

it’s estimated that organizations would need 11 
hours to triage, investigate and understand an 
incident, and 16 hours to contain and remediate, 
on average

On average

respondents estimate that it would take 
their organization 146 hours to detect a 
cybersecurity incident, compared to 117 hours 
in 2020, and 120 hours in 2019

and Other Legacy IT Vendors as Software Supply 
Chain Attacks Show No Signs of Slowing Down

Software supply chain attacks have become more prolific, with 
the Sunburst and Kaseya attacks being among the most headline\-
grabbing in recent years. The escalation in software supply chain 
attacks is supported by the fact that 77% of respondents report 
that their organization has experienced this type of attack in the 
past, increasing from 66% in 2018\. Additionally, 45% of respondents 
reported that their organization suffered from a software supply 
chain attack in the last 12 months rising from 32% in 2018 .

For cybercriminals, the beauty of software supply chain attacks is 
that while the initial objective of infiltrating a single company remains 
the same, their chances of impacting hundreds if not thousands of 
other businesses are significantly higher due to what their primary 
target specializes in.

So, considering that non\-software companies don’t have complete 
control when it comes to defending against software supply chain 
attacks, it’s essential that they have an action plan for responding 
to such a breach when it occurs. Although these strategies aren’t 
always common — almost six in ten (59%) concede that when their 
organization suffered their first software supply chain attack, they 
did not have a comprehensive strategy in place to coordinate their 
response.

This must change if these companies want to limit the damages, 
should they be on the receiving end of such an attack. And although 
they do relinquish some of the power when it comes to defending 
against this vector, they are not totally hamstrung. To do their due 
diligence, they must subject all businesses in their supply chain – 
software or otherwise – to rigorous vetting procedures.

But IT vendors must also shoulder some of the responsibility as 
they are the first line of defense against this form of cyberattack. 
This is particularly true of legacy vendors who are ingrained in the 
infrastructure of businesses worldwide – if changes are not made, 
then trust in these brands will begin to nosedive. According to 63% 
of respondents, their organization is facing a crisis of trust in legacy 
IT vendors, such as Microsoft, due to frequent security incidents. 

However, only 36% of respondents can claim that all of their 
organization’s software suppliers, new or existing, have been vetted 
for security purposes in the last 12 months. This is only a slight 
increase on the 32% reporting the same in 2018\. Taking into account 
the way in which supply chains have grown in recent years, and the 
increased dependence on these supply lines during the pandemic, 
despite the slight rise in the percentage vetting all suppliers, it still 
feels like something of a backward step.

There is also a level of over\-confidence from organizations in their 
supply chains, with 93% of respondents reporting that they have 
total or moderate confidence in the IT security of their organization’s 
suppliers. Further, a similar proportion (91%) have this same level of 
confidence in their organization’s suppliers’ supply chain security. 
These confidence levels are misplaced. If organizations do not begin 
to take more responsibility for thoroughly vetting all of their external 
suppliers and holding them to the same security standards as they 
hold themselves – something that 72% admit isn’t always the case – 
their chances of being breached are only going to increase.

2021 CrowdStrike Global Security Attitude SurveyCrowdStrike7

Perhaps most concerning of all for respondents’ organizations 
is that 84% of those surveyed believe that software supply chain 
attacks have the potential to become one of the biggest cyber 
threats to organizations like theirs within the next three years. 
This clearly reinforces the need to revisit their vetting procedures 
and their recovery strategies because if software supply chain 
attacks do become even more prevalent in the coming years, then 
organizations could find themselves in deep water. 

It also demonstrates the need for a holistic approach when it comes 
to defending against software supply chain attacks – technology 
giants such as Microsoft are not immune to this form of cyberattack, 
and rather they are the gateway onto the network for millions of 
organizations around the globe. If they do not hold themselves 
accountable, then many others could suffer. 

But, it is also important that individual companies do their due 
diligence when trying to defend against, and recover from, this type 
of attack. This means ensuring the thorough vetting of all suppliers, 
and the implementation of a comprehensive recovery strategy to 
coordinate their response if such an incident occurs.

Today’s threat environment and the supply chain attack vector 
highlights the need for organizations around the world to transform 
their security and adopt a Zero Trust architecture in order to protect 
their digital assets, identities and core infrastructure as threat 
actors are well resourced and are becoming more sophisticated. 
Organizations at all levels of the supply chain must work together 
to ensure they don’t collectively become the next victims of the 
cybercriminals executing these attacks.

Ransomware Remains a Persistent Threat, with Costs 
and Extortion Fees on the Rise

Over the last two years, much has changed for organizations around 
the globe, but one thing that has remained a constant is the danger 
posed by ransomware attacks. Arguably, this vector has been the 
most successful type of cyberattack in recent memory. And, with 
cybersecurity teams still adjusting as they aim to set up and secure 
hybrid working environments for the future, it stands to reason that 
those perpetrating these attacks will continue to see high levels of 
success.

Therefore, it makes sense that ransomware is the attack vector 
most commonly (44%) reported by respondents to be causing 
concern when thinking about IT security in their organization over 
the next 12 months. However, what is slightly surprising is that this 
proportion has decreased from the 54% reporting the same in 
2020 and has fallen back more in line with the figures of 2019 (42%) 
and 2018 (46%). Perhaps with everything else that was going on in 
2020, respondents’ levels of concern were heightened, and they 
were slightly more on edge with regard to ransomware than they 
otherwise would have been.

An alternative theory could be that IT security teams are becoming 
more adept at dealing with ransomware attacks – but does this 
argument really hold any weight?

2021 CrowdStrike Global Security Attitude SurveyCrowdStrike9

In short, the answer is a resounding “no,” and it actually appears as 
though organizations are finding it increasingly difficult to defend 
against ransomware compared to 12 months ago. Almost two\-thirds 
(66%) of those surveyed admit that their organization has suffered 
from a ransomware attack in the last 12 months – a notable rise on 
the 56% saying the same in 2020\. What’s more concerning is the 
fact that 33% have suffered multiple attacks in the past 12 months, 
compared to 24% last year.

Figure 2: Has your organization suffered from a ransomware attack in the past 12 months (whether you actually paid the ransom or not)? 

Whether the ransom is paid or not, these attacks are a drain on 
resources, and can have significant negative impacts for brand 
reputation, as well as personal impacts on the employees charged 
with fighting off a seemingly never\-ending barrage of attacks. And 
this is without even mentioning the possible consequences for 
the career of an employee who makes a mistake that leads to a 
successful ransomware breach. 

So, while these attacks are based around monetary gains for 
cybercriminals and can obviously lead to financial ramifications for 
the business due to regulatory breaches, there are plenty of other 
wide\-reaching impacts that can weigh heavily on organizations and 
employees alike.

2021 CrowdStrike Global Security Attitude SurveyCrowdStrike10

As such, it’s critical that these companies make the necessary 
adjustments when struck by ransomware to try and guard against 
future incidents. For 60% of respondents’ organizations who found 
themselves in this position over the last 12 months, they upgraded 
their security software to reduce the risk of future attacks, while 58% 
upgraded their security staff for the same reason.

But regardless of these positive steps after the event, almost a 
quarter (24%) ended up paying the ransom, which is a similar 
proportion to 2020 (27%). However, the ransoms paid over the last 
12 months have dramatically increased by nearly 63%. Last year, on 
average, respondents’ organizations were forced into paying $1\.10 
million (USD), whereas this year the average payment is $1\.79 million 
(USD). 

The situation in the Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ) region is most 
concerning of all, with the average ransom paid at $2\.35 million 
(USD), compared to $1\.55 million (USD) and $1\.34 million (USD) in the 
US and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions respectively. 
Clearly, this type of outlay isn’t sustainable for organizations, 
particularly if they’re being targeted by multiple attacks over the 
course of a year. Also, events like this could quite easily create a 
period of financial turmoil in any company that is forced into taking 
this course of action, especially as they are likely to be operating at 
a reduced level until the compromised endpoints or workloads are 
fully remediated.

Unfortunately, for the vast majority (96%) of those who ended up paying their attackers, the saga didn’t 
end there, as they were also forced into paying additional extortion fees, equating to $792,493, on 
average. These “double extortion” fees alone would be a notable outlay, but on top of an already hefty 
ransom payment, it could be a devastating blow for many organizations, particularly during a period of 
economic uncertainty. 

But, while these figures are eye\-watering, the real surprise – 
considering the well\-known prevalence of ransomware – is that 
many organizations were underprepared to deal with such an attack. 
In fact, almost six in ten (57%) of those hit by ransomware in the 
last year admit that their organization didn’t have a comprehensive 
strategy in place to coordinate their response.

2021 CrowdStrike Global Security Attitude SurveyCrowdStrike11

Moving forward, it’s imperative that organizations better equip 
themselves to deal with a ransomware breach because increasingly 
it seems as though it is a question of “when” rather than “if” they will 
suffer at the hands of this highly persistent attack vector.

And it isn’t just direct attacks against the company itself that IT 
security teams must contend with when putting together their 
response strategy. Ransomware can strike anywhere in the supply 
chain, and when this happens there is evidence to suggest that it 
might just be easier to pay the ransom to resolve the problem as 
quickly as possible. Over two\-thirds (69%) of those surveyed report 
that if their organization’s software supply chain was the subject of 
a ransomware attack, and the attacker had encrypted some or all 
of their critical data, then they would at least consider paying the 
ransom.

Nevertheless, even if ransomware is now something of an 
inevitability, and having a recovery strategy is crucial, companies 
must still proactively seek ways of minimizing their chances of 
becoming the victim of a successful attack. This means that internal 
changes will be needed – 93% of those surveyed report that 
there is at least one barrier in their organization when it comes to 
establishing a better security posture against ransomware.

Clearly, organizations must address cybersecurity awareness 
issues within their workforce (42%) and a lack of skills in their IT 
team (40%) through the implementation of a security first approach, 
including better education, training and/or recruitment procedures.

But the problems will not be solved by improving the workforce 
alone, it is also critical that organizations augment their security 
infrastructure so that they have access to more accurate and 
helpful threat intelligence, which is currently a problem for 37% of 
respondents’ organizations.

attacks? (n \= 2,200, omitting some answers)

Ransomware isn’t going anywhere, and if anything, it’s on the 
rise. Cybercriminals have had great success when targeting 
organizations during a period of upheaval over the last couple of 
years. And while IT teams continue to reinvent the way in which 
their organization operates, there will likely be ample opportunity for 
these criminals to continue exploiting any vulnerabilities when using 
ransomware as their weapon of choice.

This means that businesses around the globe must be extra vigilant 
in their defense against this threat, and in their response efforts 
should the worst happen. There are plenty of areas to be addressed 
internally that could enhance their preventative efforts, while 
implementing a comprehensive recovery strategy would also be 
advisable.

Many have paid ransoms in recent times, but with personal 
consequences for employees, along with financial and reputational 
ramifications for the organization, it’s evident that more needs to be 
done to limit the damage a ransomware breach can do.

2021 CrowdStrike Global Security Attitude SurveyCrowdStrike13

Organizations Are Moving in the Wrong Direction When 
It Comes to Detection and Response Time

All things considered, being a member of an IT or cybersecurity team 
over the last couple of years has been an unenviable task. A range of 
–
threats – including ransomware and software supply chain attacks 
have become more persistent and pervasive than ever, and all the 
while these teams have been trying to redesign how their entire 
organization operates from an IT standpoint.

Despite the rising difficulty of defending against these attack 
vectors, the threat posed by nation\-states, cybercriminal gangs, 
and the mitigating factors imposed by the pandemic, it’s clear that 
organizations must find a way to improve when detecting security 
incidents as they are unfortunately getting slower. On average, 
respondents estimate that it would take their organization a 
staggering 146 hours to detect a cybersecurity incursion, which is 
a stark increase on the averages reported in 2020 and 2019, which 
were 117 hours and 120 hours, respectively.

Alarmingly, before many organizations even realize that they have 
experienced an intrusion, the malicious actor could have been on 
their network for slightly over six full days. In fact, CrowdStrike’s 
Falcon OverWatch™ threat hunting team reported that eCrime threat 
actors are able to move laterally across an organization’s network 
in an average of 92 minutes. Recent attacks have shown that many 
breaches involve more than just malware. Attackers are increasingly 
attempting to accomplish their objectives without using malware, 
exploiting the proliferation of vulnerabilities, and abusing systemic 
weaknesses in identity architecture to get on the system and then 
moving laterally. This makes it more difficult for legacy and next\-
generation malware products to be effective because they are not 
focused on breach prevention. Companies must embrace a holistic, 
platform approach to security – one that employs both automation 
and the human element of managed threat hunting – to fight off these 
pervasive threats.

Figure 4: Showing the average time in hours 
that respondents estimate it would take 
their organization to detect a cybersecurity 
incursion/incident 

2021 CrowdStrike Global Security Attitude SurveyCrowdStrike14

But, upon detection of the threat there is still plenty of work to be 
done before the business can once again consider itself secure. 
According to respondents, it would take their organization 
an average of 11 hours to triage, investigate and understand a 
cybersecurity incident, and 16 hours to contain and remediate it. In 
total this means that, on average, from start to finish there are 174 
hours – more than seven days – for the intruder to achieve their 
objective.

Evidently, this is a far cry from the 1\-10\-60 paradigm that IT security teams 
should be striving for.
In an ideal world, this would mean that the incursion is detected in one minute, with 10 minutes allocated 
to investigating the threat, and then 60 minutes for containing and remediating the issue. There are a 
range of reasons as to why organizations could be struggling to get close to this model, but if they do 
not improve their response times, then their data could be gone before they’re aware that they have a 
problem. 

One of those mitigating circumstances has unquestionably been 
the shift to remote working, which has challenged IT teams like 
never before, and has of course opened organizations up to a range 
of new risks. Unfortunately, 69% of respondents’ organizations 
have suffered a cybersecurity incident as a direct result of their 
organizations working remotely. These incidents could have 
happened for any number of reasons – including human error, which 
IT teams can only do so much to control – but it does reinforce the 
need for organizations to address their security flaws if they hope 
to negate the additional risks posed by remote and hybrid working 
setups.

However, if there is one positive to come out of the pandemic from 
an IT point of view, it is that cybersecurity has been brought into the 
consciousness of a wider range of people. According to 86% of 
respondents, COVID\-19 has been a significant or notable turning 
point in cybersecurity for this very reason and there is a feeling that 
people are now beginning to realize the importance of IT security. 
This can only be a good thing for IT teams, as it should help to reduce 
the number of incidents that occur due to a lack of awareness from 
employees around what is expected of them in terms of security 
best practice.

2021 CrowdStrike Global Security Attitude SurveyCrowdStrike15

Nevertheless, there are also areas that are under the direct 
control of IT teams that are preventing them from responding 
in a timely fashion when incidents occur. More than nine in ten 
(92%) respondents cite at least one issue that is preventing their 
organization from detecting, triaging, investigating, understanding, 
containing and remediating cybersecurity incursions faster. Chief 
among these areas, reported by 47% of those surveyed, is that 
their organization’s security infrastructure is made up of too many 
disparate solutions that don’t easily integrate for proper protection 
and prevention.

While this isn’t the only issue holding surveyed organizations 
back, it does seem to be the most pressing and highlights the fact 
that an integrated, best\-of\-breed approach is the way forward. 
Organizations must untangle the web of tools that they have stitched 
together over the years, and instead implement a fully integrated 
solution that can streamline their security infrastructure, thus 
improving its levels of performance.

Until they have achieved this objective, they will most probably 
continue to experience long detection times and will be no closer to 
the 1\-10\-60 benchmark. This presents far too great an opportunity 
for cybercriminals to get onto their network, find what they’re looking 
for, and get off again, potentially undetected.

In a world where the prevalence and pervasiveness of a wide range 
of cyberattacks is only trending in one direction, organizations 
cannot allow this problem to linger. Acting slowly here will cause 
them a huge amount of financial and reputational pain, which is not 
something that they can afford as their recovery from the pandemic 
continues.

CrowdStrike Perspective

The insights obtained from security leaders and practitioners on the front lines could not be clearer. The 
data shows that the threats that organizations are encountering every day continue to accelerate with 
no sign of letting up. Ransomware continues to be a lucrative avenue for threat actors to monetize their 
access, made easier by the rapidly evaporating perimeter, enabled by the eCrime ecosystem, driving 
consistently larger paydays for cybercriminals. No organization is immune; these trends track across 
industries, geographies and organizational size.

This is the time for defenders to step up their game, but unfortunately that’s not happening. We see 
clearly that the time to detect emerging threats has increased dramatically over the last 12 months. When 
asked, we see a consistent pattern in the responses. Security organizations are held back by complex 
technology stacks that are not well integrated, which introduces enormous friction for security teams, 
while also burying them in mountains of alerts that may hide the true nature of inbound attacks. On top of 
this, security leaders have lost trust in many of their legacy technology partners, and lack a clear vision for 
the future.

These trends are on a collision course. Security leaders need to solve for this imbalance if they are going 
to avoid a damaging breach. CrowdStrike has been focused on tipping these scales for defenders from 
Day One, and built the CrowdStrike Falcon® platform to address these challenges head on. 

The cloud\-native CrowdStrike Falcon platform is fed by a lightweight agent that intelligently collects, 
enriches and analyzes trillions of events every day, producing actionable insights for security teams. 
Falcon delivers a foundation for security teams that is simple to deploy, manage and monitor, dramatically 
reducing alert fatigue. The platform is trusted by thousands of customers worldwide for protecting 
endpoints from the most sophisticated threats, and extends seamlessly to address cloud security, Zero 
Trust, XDR and a wide range of plug\-and\-play partner integrations via the CrowdStrike Store. Additionally, 
CrowdStrike integrates both managed threat hunting and best\-in\-class threat intelligence into its security 
stack. CrowdStrike’s Falcon OverWatch team hunts relentlessly to see and stop the stealthiest, most 
sophisticated threats and helps organizations to make informed decisions to stay ahead of threats. This 
winning combination empowers security teams to automatically investigate incidents and accelerate 
alert triage and response. Both are built directly into the Falcon platform, and are able to be deployed and 
operational within seconds.

CrowdStrike is recognized as a leader by major industry analysts, including Gartner, Forrester and IDC, 
and is proven in independent third\-party testing to be highly effective in stopping today’s sophisticated 
threats. 

It’s imperative for security leaders to invest in modern security architecture, or risk becoming another 
cyber statistic. CrowdStrike remains committed to partnering with organizations around the globe to 
understand the challenges security teams face today, and to delivering trusted solutions needed to stay 
ahead of the adversary in the future.

Methodology

CrowdStrike commissioned independent technology market research specialist Vanson Bourne to undertake 
the quantitative research upon which this white paper is based. A total of 2,200 senior IT decision makers and IT 
security professionals were interviewed during September, October and November 2021, with representation 
across the US, EMEA and APAC regions.

All respondents had to be from organizations with 100 or more employees and are from a range of private 
and public sectors. The interviews were split equally between senior IT decision makers and IT security 
professionals, and equally between organizations of 100\-1,999 employees and 2,000\+ employees.

Online and telephone interviews were conducted using a rigorous multi\-level screening process to ensure 
that only suitable candidates were given the opportunity to participate. Unless otherwise indicated the results 
discussed are based on the total sample.
