AWS CLOUD 
SECURITY 
REPORT

INTRODUCTION

Cloud security concerns remain high as the adoption of public cloud computing continues to 
surge in the wake of the COVID crisis and the resulting massive shift to remote work environments.

The 2021 AWS Cloud Security Report is based on a comprehensive survey of 316 cybersecurity 
professionals to uncover how AWS user organizations are responding to new security threats in 
the cloud, and what tools and best practices cybersecurity leaders are prioritizing in their move 
to the cloud.

This year’s survey saw some significant changes in how organizations manage remediation of 
security and compliance issues with system owners. The reported remediation cadences of real\-
time, ad\-hoc, and before\-audit fire drills all declined between 10 and 13 percentage points since 
2020\. While the numbers for quarterly and weekly remediation cadences stayed the same, these 
declines indicate positive process improvements.

Key survey findings include:

• More than nine out of ten cybersecurity professionals (95%) confirm they are extremely to 

moderately concerned about public cloud security. 

• Misconfiguration of the cloud platform remains the top concern (71%). Exfiltration of sensitive 

data came in second (59%), followed by insecure APIs (54%). 

• Periodic vulnerability and compliance reports are still the primary method for organizations 
(58%) to communicate with system owners about security and compliance issues needing 
remediation. This is followed by automatically opened tickets (47%) using tools such as Jira, 
ServiceNow, etc. 

• Organizations increasingly embrace hybrid cloud (44%) and multi\-cloud deployments (43%) 

for planned redundancy because of commitments to legacy applications in traditional data 
centers. Single cloud deployments (11%) continue to diminish in importance. Ninety percent 
of organizations use more than two cloud providers. 

• When selecting a cloud security provider, organizations prioritize cost\-effectiveness (66%), 
scalability (52%), ease of deployment (51%), and tools that can be deployed with automation 
(48%) as the top four criteria.

We would like to thank CloudPassage for supporting this important industry research project. 

We hope you find this report informative and helpful as you continue your efforts in securing 
your journey into the cloud. 

Thank you,

PUBLIC CLOUD SECURITY CONCERNS

Cloud security concerns are improving somewhat but remain high as the adoption of public cloud 
computing continues to surge in the wake of the COVID crisis and the resulting shift to remote 
work environments. Ninety\-five percent of cybersecurity professionals confirm they are extremely 
to moderately concerned about public cloud security.

Despite the increasing security measures already offered by cloud providers, such as Amazon Web 
Services, cloud users are ultimately responsible for securing their own workloads in the cloud. When 
asked about their biggest cloud security challenges, cybersecurity professionals in our survey are 
highlighting the risk of data loss and leakage (67%), threats to data privacy (61%), and accidental 
exposure of credentials (49%) as the top three security concerns.

This year, we are observing some shifts in what security professionals see as the biggest cloud 
security threats. While misconfiguration of the cloud platform/wrong set\-up remains the top 
concern (71% from 49% in 2020\), exfiltration of sensitive data rose to second place (59%). This is 
followed by insecure APIs (54%, up from 47%), moving from the second highest concern to third 
place. Unauthorized access dropped from third to fourth place (53%) while external sharing of data 
remained in fifth place (44%).

We asked cybersecurity pros who in their organization are accountable for technical changes to 
systems required to remediate security or compliance problems. The responsibility is spread fairly 
evenly among system engineers, security engineers, and DevOps engineers. This suggests that there 
is no single “best practice” yet regarding who should be making changes for security and compliance. 
While the majority of those responsible for changes are still in a centralized IT, InfoSec, or DevOps 
organization, 24% have moved to a model with distributed DevOps teams reporting to business units 
(up 2 points from 22% in 2020\). 

Who is accountable for actual technical changes to systems that are required to 
remediate security or compliance problems? 

System engineers within a central IT
operations/hosting ops organization

Security engineers within a central
information security organization

DevOps engineers within a central
DevOps organization (central DevOps)

DevOps engineers within individual
business units (distributed DevOps)

Periodic vulnerability and compliance reports (58%) are still the primary method for organizations 
to communicate with system owners about security and compliance issues needing remediation. 
This is followed by automated trouble tickets (47%) that are opened using tools such as Jira, 
ServiceNow, etc., and scheduled in\-person meetings (42%, up from 31% in 2020\). It is a positive 
sign that ad\-hoc emails as a remediation method declined to 33% from 40% in 2020\.

REMEDIATION 

This year’s survey saw some significant changes in how organizations manage remediation of security 
and compliance issues with system owners. The reported remediation cadences of real\-time, ad\-
hoc, and before\-audit fire drills all declined between 10 and 13 percentage points in 2021 from 2020\. 
However, the numbers for quarterly and weekly remediation cadences stayed the same, indicating 
positive process improvements. Of some concern is that monthly remediation cadence increased 
significantly from 37% to 52% year\-over\-year.

We asked the survey participants what multi\-cloud security challenges they are experiencing. Ensuring 
data protection and privacy for each environment leads the list with 58%. This is followed by the 
perennial challenge of procuring the right skillset in\-house to deploy and manage security solutions 
across cloud environments (57%) and understanding how different solutions fit together (52%). These 
results suggest that organizations could reduce complexity and achieve productivity improvements 
with cloud security and compliance solutions that worked consistently across cloud service vendors.

More than half of organizations use between three to six different dashboards to configure cloud 
security policies (66%). This requirement significantly increases the cost and complexity of managing 
security across multi\-cloud environments and negatively impacts security posture. These results 
do not take into account the multiple dashboards that security professionals may have to access to 
secure assets hosted in\-house, highlighting the need for vendors to offer comprehensive security 
solutions for multi\-and hybrid cloud deployments.

data across cloud environments.
