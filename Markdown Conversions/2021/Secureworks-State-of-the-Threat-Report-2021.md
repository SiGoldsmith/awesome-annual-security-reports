Summary and 
Key Findings

The past year has seen headlines dominated by stories of cyberattacks: 

Russian supply chain attacks, Chinese espionage groups compromising 

tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers, and widespread and 

brazen ransomware attacks by Russia\-based cybercriminals.

Condemnations from the U.S. and their allies followed each of 

these attacks, aimed at shining a light on the perpetrators and holding 

hostile governments accountable for the malicious cyber activity they 

have conducted and enabled. The threat level to businesses globally 

remains high, especially as many organizations are rapidly pursuing IT 

transformation to support operations in a pandemic environment.

Amidst all this activity, Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU™) 

researchers continue to track these threats and use their knowledge 

to develop insights and protections for Secureworks’ customers. Their 

high\-level findings for the period June 2020 to June 2021 are, in order 

of risk presented to Secureworks’ customers:

Ransomware Remains

for Most Organizations

The post\-intrusion ransomware landscape is thriving. Volume of 

incidents, number of ransomware operators, and average ransom 

demands all continue to increase. The ransomware\-as\-a\-service1 

affiliate model allows operators to scale their operations and 

significantly lowers the barrier to entry. A successful ransomware 

attack can instantaneously cripple even the largest of organizations.

account for more than half of the financial crime incidents worked by 

Secureworks incident responders.

Organizations that apply good security basics can demonstrably 

reduce their chances of falling victim to ransomware attacks, yet a

Conclusion

How Secureworks 
Carries Out Attribution

Threat group names used by Secureworks refer to observed 
activity clusters or intrusion sets. If CTU researchers attribute 

an attack to a group, it is because the indicators and the 

tactics, techniques, and procedures observed during the 

attack match or align with those seen in previous activity 

attributed to the group. Groups are also clusters of individuals, 

but individual threat actors may work for more than one group, 

or may change groups. 

The names are based on metals. In this report you will meet 

GOLD cybercriminal groups, as well as state\-sponsored 

groups that are IRON (Russia), BRONZE (China), COBALT (Iran), 
or NICKEL (North Korea). The Secureworks Threat Group 
profiles are available on the Secureworks website with further 
information about most of the groups featured in this report.

GOLD ULRICK – Back Refreshed 
and With Different Tradecraft

GOLD ULRICK is the distributor of the Conti and Ryuk ransomware 

families. GOLD ULRICK is likely comprised of some or all of the same 

operators as GOLD BLACKBURN, the group responsible for the 

distribution of malware such as TrickBot, BazarLoader, and Buer 

Loader. Ryuk was one of the most prevalent ransomware strains 

encountered by Secureworks incident responders from late 2018 

through 2019\. It seemed to have disappeared between February and 

September 2020 but attacks then resumed activity, alongside ‘name\-

and\-shame’ attacks using the Conti ransomware.

05

Scan\-and\-Exploit

CTU researchers assess that since approximately late 2019, GOLD 

ULRICK began expanding its activities by working with various other 

operators who were recruited through existing trusted relationships 

rather than via adverts on underground forums. In August 2021, a 

persona claiming to be a disgruntled Conti affiliate released a swathe 

of information including tools and standard operating procedures 

provided to Conti affiliates by GOLD ULRICK.

Conclusion

Prior to February 2020, Ryuk attacks typically followed a consistent 

playbook: leveraging an existing TrickBot infection for initial access, 

deploying PowerShell Empire or Cobalt Strike across the environment, 

and then staging Ryuk on domain controllers and deploying it widely 

across the enterprise using either PSExec and batch scripts or Group 

Policy Objects. The script below is a PowerShell script used to create 

a Group Policy Object that weakens domain\-joined systems’ security 

settings prior to deployment of Ryuk.

However, since September 2020 this expansion has resulted in 

divergent tactics, techniques and procedures during observed 

intrusions involving Ryuk and Conti deployments. In one example in 

early 2021, Secureworks incident responders helped an organization 

where the threat actor had accessed the environment using stolen 

VPN credentials and deployed Conti manually to a small number of 

systems using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Not only is this a 

significant departure from previously observed tactics, techniques and 

procedures (TTPs), but the more localized deployment also caused far 

less impact to the affected organization, very unlike previous GOLD 

ULRICK intrusions where enterprises have experienced weeks or 

months of downtime.

Name\-and\-Shame Remains 
the Name of the Game

Name\-and\-shame attacks allow for ‘double extortion’. Victims 

are under pressure to pay to recover their data (availability), but also 

to prevent it being published online (confidentiality). For some, 

the threat of sensitive business or client information being made 

public may be worse than the consequences of their systems being 

encrypted. The extra threat also comes with a deadline to pay, 

increasing the pressure to hand over the ransom to avoid further pain 

in an already painful situation.

Name\-and\-shame has become the predominant operating method 

for most ransomware groups, with victims being added to public leak 

sites at a worrying rate. The most active name\-and\-shame ransomware 

group over the past year was GOLD PHANTOM’s Egregor, adding an 

average of 60 victims a month to its leak site between its launch in 

September 2020 and its apparent demise at the end of 2020\. GOLD 

ULRICK added an average of 23 new Conti victims a month across 

the entire period. Grief, the successor to DoppelPaymer launched by 

GOLD HERON at the end of May 2021, added 23 during June alone.

Ransomware Remains 
the Number One Threat 
for Most Organizations

Name\-and\-shame dark web leak sites provide useful insight into the 

activities of these ransomware groups but may be misleading in terms 

of scale. They only list organizations that have not immediately paid 

ransom demands, and they may not list all victims. When Avaddon 

ceased operation in June 2021, its public leak site had listed a total 

of 182 victims since the beginning of June 2020\. However, when the 

group shut down its operation, it released a total of 2,934 individual 

decryption keys2, each corresponding to a specific victim. That’s 

nearly 16 times as many and shows that often only a minority of 

victims will appear on their public sites.

There are also still successful ransomware operations that do not use 

name\-and\-shame tactics, such as GOLD DUPONT. CTU researchers 

05

Scan\-and\-Exploit

have observed GOLD DUPONT successfully operate Defray and 777 

ransomware in several fast and extremely aggressive post\-intrusion 

attacks using Vatet loader, a file transfer tool called ArtifactExx, Cobalt 

Strike, PyXie RAT, and a variety of native Windows utilities. However, 

there are now significantly more successful ransomware operations 

that incorporate name\-and\-shame tactics than do not.

Conclusion

Hack and Leak — A Move 
Away from Encryption? 

Some operators have experimented with 
data theft and extortion only: 

• 

In the December 2020 attack on the Accellion File 
Transfer Appliance (FTA) software by GOLD TAHOE, 
operator of Clop ransomware, all the attacker did was 

exfiltrate data from the Accellion appliance and post it 

to the Clop leak site. 

• Babuk separately claimed to have abandoned 

ransomware in favor of theft and extortion only in late 

April 2021, although with limited success. 

• 

In one incident worked by Secureworks incident 

responders, the threat actor was disturbed during their 

lateral expansion and consolidation activity. In response 

to being disrupted, the group immediately shifted into 

demanding an extortion payment to prevent the data 

they had already stolen being leaked online.

It is unclear whether theft and extortion without data 

encryption is a viable business model, even when it is done 

well. Manufacturing organizations, for example, are far more 

likely to feel the pain of production downtime caused by 

critical systems being unavailable. Victims based in countries 

with relaxed regulatory regimes may not feel sufficiently 

pressured to prevent data leaking into the public domain to 

pay the extortion fees demanded.

systems based on the perceived maturity of a potential victim’s security 

controls, and the victim’s annual revenue. Some ransomware groups 

may prioritize certain victims due to perceived success. For example, 

previous attacks on manufacturing organizations showed that forcing 

critical manufacturing processes offline provides a strong incentive for 

the victim to pay the ransom. 

Once inside the network the attacker will attempt to target or discover 

the files and processes that would give them most leverage when 

disrupted, exfiltrated or encrypted. For example, the Clop operator 

has been reported to prioritize access to the workstations of senior 

executives during exfiltration of data from victim organizations. The 

reason for this tactic is reported to be to obtain the most valuable 

information.

In other words, post\-intrusion operators are generally selective 

about the victims they hit once initial access has been gained 

and a degree of triage carried out, but the initial compromise 

is opportunistic. Ultimately, ransomware attacks occur where 

access can be most easily obtained and maintained.

Buying and Selling Access

Executive Summary

About the Report

Ransomware Remains 
the Number One Threat 
for Most Organizations

Offers of access brokering on underground forums is widespread 

and IABs are used by both ransomware\-as\-a\-service (RaaS) and 

private ransomware groups. CTU researchers frequently observe 

advertisements for access to organizations in a wide range of 

verticals, with healthcare, hospitality, retail, and education being the 

most common.

In May 2021, a single forum persona tracked by CTU researchers 

advertised VPN/RDP access to multiple companies in France and 

the U.S., including a medical research company, a hotel complex, a 

restaurant chain, and a tobacco and beverage company. The asking

price was $800 USD in total. Two different threat actors were selling 

Listings do not name the victim but do provide basic details such as 

sector, geography, and revenue. A threat actor buying that access will 

only find out who the victim is once they have paid into an escrow 

account run by the forum.

CTU researchers have also observed ransomware operators advertising 

to buy access, rather than IABs advertising to sell it. One example 

of this is the BlackMatter ransomware, likely operated by the GOLD 

WATERFALL threat group who previously operated the DarkSide RaaS.

Affiliates Drive Scale 

Executive Summary 
and Key Findings

About the Report

Ransomware Remains 
the Number One Threat 
for Most Organizations

The RaaS model has been fundamental in driving scale in the 

ransomware ecosystem. The use of affiliates greatly increases the 

number of organizations that can be targeted concurrently. Conversely, 

the scale of ransomware activities may be constrained or gated by the 

number of human operators available. Affiliate schemes are therefore 

key enablers to ‘growth’, but attack sophistication can vary when 

affiliates have different skill levels.

usually manage the process of negotiation with victims, limiting the 

number of affiliates allows them to manage the number of victims they 

are negotiating with. 

Affiliates can also cause groups problems. It is thought that 

affiliates were behind both the REvil Kaseya attack and the 

DarkSide Colonial Pipeline attack. To control risks of this nature, 

some operators may forbid affiliates from proceeding with attacks 

on organizations in certain sectors e.g., healthcare, education, non\-

profit organizations, critical infrastructure. Limiting the number of 

affiliates also helps with oversight.

Conclusion

It is likely that affiliates and RaaS operators form enduring relationships 

when mutually beneficial. However, each RaaS operation has a limited 

number of affiliate ‘seats’ available, so affiliates may move to another 

RaaS operation once a campaign is complete. For example, Babuk 

operators claimed at the beginning of 2021 they could support two 

affiliates concurrently, while GOLD SOUTHFIELD claimed that the REvil 

RaaS could support ten prior to it being shut down. Because operators

Law Enforcement 
and Government Action 
Against Ransomware

The cumulative impact of ransomware attacks is now being viewed 

by governments as a national security threat, driven in part by public 

services being impacted by attacks against healthcare providers, fuel 

distribution organizers, and more. 

In early June 2021, the FBI director, Christopher Wray, said3 that 

cybercrime threat presented “a lot of parallels” to the threat of 

terrorism before 9/11\. In response to a question about whether the 

05

Scan\-and\-Exploit

U.S. was considering military action against ransomware operators, the 

commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, said4 that “all the options” were 

being considered. So far, a range of different response options are 

being used.

This increasingly assertive law enforcement response is unlikely to 

change direction in the short term. The ransomware problem remains 

a difficult one to address. Many of the operators are located either in 

Russia or in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. If 

they avoid targeting Russian or CIS entities as victims, they are largely 

The Impact of Malware 
Loader Takedowns 

Both TrickBot and Emotet were the targets of takedown 

activity. There were two operations against TrickBot , one in 
September 20205 by U.S. Cyber Command, and then separate 
actions by Microsoft6 in October and November. There 
was one against the Emotet botnet in late January 2021 by 
international law enforcement7\. 

By the beginning of 2021, TrickBot’s operator GOLD 

BLACKBURN had rebuilt its botnet. TrickBot is now back at 

full strength. GOLD BLACKBURN has also increased its use of 

other malware including Team9 (also known as BazarLoader) 

and BuerLoader. The Emotet botnet, operated by the GOLD 

CRESTWOOD threat group since 2014, has not reconstituted, 

although CTU researchers assess that the GOLD CRESTWOOD 

threat group will re\-tool or begin to collaborate more directly 

with other cybercriminal groups such as the GOLD LAGOON 

threat group that operates the QakBot botnet. 

By 2020, the Emotet malware distribution or ‘loads’ service 

was only servicing TrickBot, Qakbot and, according to open 
source reporting,8 IcedID. All of these botnets have their own 
distribution capabilities, so they simply switched to their own 

distribution methods. Overall, there has been little significant 

change in the amount of malware being distributed to 

left alone by law enforcement. Some actors have been linked with 

potential victims.

elements of the Russian government and intelligence services, including 

Maksim Yakubets who was indicted by the U.S. in 2019 for cybercrime 

offenses. Yakubets previously worked for the Russian Federal Security 

Service (FSB) and is thought to have FSB familial ties.

Law enforcement and government action against ransomware threat actors

The Biden administration has raised concerns about ransomware with 

Russia’s President Putin and has claimed that its message has been 

heard. It is positive that ransomware is now on the agenda for such 

high\-profile dialogue, although the prospects for substantive action 

being taken. Russia has a long\-standing history of non\-extradition 

to the U.S. and other countries, and it is unclear what the U.S. and

It seems likely that the game of ransomware whack\-a\-mole will 

continue for some time to come. Indeed, the overall level of activity 

in the ransomware space as a whole has not changed greatly, despite 

these interventions. By being careful to avoid organizations that 

significantly impact critical infrastructure or public services, most RaaS 

and private operations can operate below the threshold at which 

public opinion will force a more aggressive law enforcement response.

Conclusion

Organizations Can 
Protect Themselves

Despite takedowns and other law enforcement activity, the 

opportunistic nature of attacks, combined with the drive to 

scale, mean that all organizations need to be at the top of 

their security game.

Organizations that patch promptly and regularly, protect external 

facing applications with multi\-factor authentication, implement the 

principle of least privilege, segment networks, and implement endpoint 

and network traffic monitoring and detection can protect themselves 

against ransomware. It is no coincidence that the financial sector, 

subject to all\-encompassing regulatory requirements concerning 

security, is less prone to ransomware than other, less strictly 

regulated sectors. Organizations can and do protect themselves 

against ransomware every day.

Conclusion

 An administrative user was prompted to approve a 
VPN access request that they did not initiate. A threat 

actor was likely using a stolen or guessed username 

and password in an attempt to access the user’s VPN 

account. Because the organization used multi\-factor 

authentication (MFA) the user had an opportunity 

to reject the request. The subsequent investigation 

showed that this one control was critical in preventing 

the threat actor being able to gain privileged access 

to the environment. 

 CTU researchers discovered a Cobalt Strike command 
and control IP address identified from one DarkSide 

ransomware engagement in another organization’s 

firewall logs. The customer was notified, initiated 

their incident response procedures, and uncovered 

evidence of credential theft, privilege escalation, 

installation of Cobalt Strike across multiple systems, 

and access to business\-critical servers. The 

organization was able to contain the intrusion before 

the threat actor was able to deploy ransomware. 

Although indicator\-based controls are insufficient 

on their own, they can sometimes help and should 

certainly not be dismissed.

Loaders and the Impact of 
Law Enforcement Takedowns

Whether the ultimate payload is ransomware or cryptominers, 

loader malware and botnets have always played a significant part 

in delivery. Emotet had long been one of the most prevalent and 

successful malware families affecting enterprise organizations, and it 

often provided the initial access point for ransomware groups. But in 

January 2021 the Emotet botnet disappeared, successfully disrupted 

by a collaborative effort between law enforcement agencies from 

the Netherlands, Germany, United States, United Kingdom, France, 

Lithuania, Canada and Ukraine in one of the most wide\-reaching law 

enforcement actions against malware ever seen. Emotet disappeared 

and has not returned. 

Beyond Ransomware, 
the Broader Cybercrime 
Landscape Continues 
To Flourish

The successful disruption of Emotet left a vacuum. The loader 

ecosystem quickly moved to fill it. Botnets active in the past year have 

included IcedID, Chanitor, Cutwail, Dridex, QakBot, Flubot, and Teabot.

Conclusion

• IcedID in particular has increased its activity levels. Despite 

a month\-long hiatus in June 2021, it has been widely 
distributed through multiple services, and many threat 
groups have leveraged the botnet to distribute Cobalt Strike.

• Chanitor has increased its distribution tempo to three to 
four campaigns per week, distributing Ficker Stealer and 
Cobalt Strike. This is likely now the largest botnet regularly 
distributing credential theft malware.

• GOLD HERON has used several spam services, including 

Cutwail, to distribute Dridex 2\.0, Cobalt Strike, and ultimately

Conclusion

• GOLD BLACKBURN, at one point the largest customer of 
Emotet, has had no difficulty finding alternative distribution 
channels for TrickBot and BazarLoader. These malware 
families remain top sources of Conti and Ryuk ransomware 
infections. TrickBot has also re\-implemented web injection 
capability signaling a possible return to high\-value financial 
transaction fraud.

• GOLD LAGOON, like GOLD BLACKBURN, was also a 
customer of Emotet. It has continued operations since 
the takedown with Qakbot malware. It has used its own 
infrastructure to distribute Qakbot using familiar hijacking of 
reply\-to chains in email spam campaigns.

In some cases where the victim is running Active Directory, Qakbot has 

been used to drop Cobalt Strike, which has then led to ransomware. 

Qakbot C2 infrastructure appeared to go down in early July 2021\. 

Initially it appeared as if the disappearance might be permanent, but 

GOLD LAGOON restarted Qakbot activity in September 2021\.

Increased law enforcement activity and collaboration with industry is 

undoubtedly a good thing. However, it remains challenging to deliver 

long\-lasting change when the main players remain out of reach from 

more traditional law enforcement action. Inevitably, law enforcement 

action leads to evolution in the remaining botnet landscape and 

sometimes removing well\-known well\-understood capabilities makes it

Ransomware Remains 
the Number One Threat 
for Most Organizations

One further change comes from the growth of mobile botnets, 

particularly FluBot and TeaBot. These are primarily delivered via 

package delivery scam text messages (also known as SMS phishing 

or smishing), affecting users in Europe. With the growth in online 

shopping prompted by the COVID\-19 pandemic, missed delivery 

texts are designed to elicit action from unsuspecting consumers. 

Spam campaigns have been constant (including over weekends) 

and the threat actors regularly updated both the malware and their 

infrastructure in order to reach different geographies.

2021 State of the Threat: A Year in ReviewIdentity Abuse is Not New, 
But it is Evolving

Threat actors subverting authentication mechanisms is nothing new. In 

2017 CTU researchers reported on IRON TWILIGHT abusing OAuth to 

retain access to targeted email accounts. Most on\-premises network 

intrusions, whether they be ransomware or cyber espionage, have 

long involved credential theft that is then used for privilege escalation, 

lateral movement and data access. 

It is likely that more adversaries will begin to adopt these techniques. 

As organizations increasingly move data and resources into cloud 

services, compromising the right user identities can potentially grant 

unfettered access to sensitive data and systems. 

What Do I Need To Do?

It’s increasingly important in the face of these identity\-based 

threats that organizations understand the level of risk they face with 

centralized authentication systems and adapt their mitigation strategies 

accordingly. However, attacks that abuse application permissions or 

compromise authentication mechanisms are extremely difficult to 

Targeting MFA 

One of the most important things that organizations can do to 

protect themselves against attacks is to implement multi\-factor 

authentication. Inevitably, as a result, threat actors are trying 

to find ways to subvert MFA.

• 

Iranian threat group COBALT ILLUSION has used 
social engineering techniques to convince targets 

to divulge SMS codes and other multi\-factor tokens 

to bypass MFA.

• A March 2021 Secureworks incident response 

engagement revealed how a threat actor used a 

loophole in the MFA implementation to bypass it. After 

accessing a Microsoft 365 email account with stolen 

or guessed credentials, the threat actor attempted to 

access an MFA\-protected Citrix system. The MFA system 

had an option to send the MFA token to the user’s email 

address, which was not protected by MFA, meaning 

it could be accessed with just a static password. This 

defeated the purpose of MFA, which should require 
access to a physical device such as a phone or token.

threat actor can create a malicious application that

China

Chinese threat groups remain extremely active, with a continued 
focus on intellectual property theft, access operations against 
core telecommunications and internet infrastructure operators, and 
traditional espionage against political and military targets. 

Chinese threat groups are demonstrating increased operational 

security and increased levels of coordination, including sharing of 

tools and exploits as well as extensive use of commodity tooling to 

make attribution more challenging. Likely as a result of organizational 

restructuring within the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), some PLA\-

linked threat groups also appear to be practicing clearer deconfliction 

of operations, with an increased focus on specific geographies rather 

than on particular types of target organization.

In general, Chinese groups appear to have improved their operational 

security over the period, making detection of activity harder. They 

have used ‘living off the land’ (using tools already available in the 

Identity is King

target environment) more, and they have followed other countries 

in preferring openly available tools such as Cobalt Strike to bespoke 

tools. However, there have also been elements of business as usual. 

PlugX remains a popular tool with multiple groups, while BRONZE 

UNION continues its use of HyperBro.

Conclusion

Other observed Chinese threat group activity 
during the period has included:

• Ongoing targeting of near\-neighbor countries that are part of the 
Belt and Road initiative, China’s global infrastructure development 
investment strategy program.

• The use by BRONZE PRESIDENT of USB sticks to disseminate 
PlugX malware in October and November 2020\. The November 
incident involved an updated version of PlugX that deleted older 
PlugX malware. This is not a new technique for the group – in 
early 2020 it had used USB drives in campaigns in Southeast Asia, 
particularly Myanmar. Secureworks has also seen it in use against 
international NGOs and food industry organizations, as well as in 
Thailand and Japan.

• The use by groups like BRONZE SPIRAL of small office and 

home office (SOHO) routers in the target country as the last 
hop of an attack. This makes attribution more difficult and 
also makes attack traffic look like it is terminating in the same 
country as the target, which might allow it to blend in as 
legitimate network traffic.

environments (see below).

Conclusion

In one case, CTU researchers observed the BRONZE UNION threat 

group using the Exchange vulnerabilities to re\-gain access to an 

environment that they had recently been evicted from.

While the degree of sharing that took place during these intrusions 

was notable, it appears increasingly common. In fact, knowledge and 

tool sharing across Chinese APTs is not considered unusual, with 

groups using malware provided by the same ‘Digital Quartermaster’. A 

Digital Quartermaster is thought to be an organization that develops, 

maintains and supplies malware to operational threat groups that are 

responsible for the intrusion activity.

There is also evidence of multiple groups sharing exploits prior to them 

being publicly available. This manifestation of closer tradecraft sharing 

is likely to be one result of the restructuring of the People’s Liberation 

Army (PLA) that has been under way since late 2015\. It is highly likely 

that similar levels of sharing are going on with groups connected to 

the Ministry of State Security (MSS), which also has a remit to conduct 

overseas cyber operations.

One example is ShadowPad, a modular remote access trojan (RAT) that 

can extract information about the host, execute commands, interact 

with the file system and registry, and deploy new modules to extend 

functionality. CTU researchers assess that ShadowPad is currently 

used by at least eight different Chinese threat groups against targets 

globally including the U.S. and UK. CTU researchers discovered that 

many of the threat groups observed using ShadowPad since the 

beginning of 2019 such as BRONZE BUTLER and BRONZE HUNTLEY 

have been linked to the Chinese PLA. Before 2019 only BRONZE 

ATLAS, a group operating on behalf of the MSS, leveraged the 

ShadowPad malware. Most recently, CTU discovered a sample linked to

Supernova

In a November 202022 incident response engagement, CTU analysts 

observed a likely China\-based threat group leveraging SolarWinds 

software to deploy the SUPERNOVA web shell. Earlier in 2020, 

Secureworks incident responders identified similar intrusion activity 

on the same network. Analysis suggested that the threat actor initially 

gained access as early as 2018 by exploiting a vulnerable public\-

facing ManageEngine ServiceDesk server. attacker used their access 

to periodically harvest and exfiltrate domain credentials. In August 

2020, the threat actor returned to the network via the ManageEngine 

ServiceDesk server, harvested credentials from two servers, likely 

exfiltrated these credentials through the ManageEngine server, and 

then used them to access files from Microsoft 365\-hosted SharePoint 

and OneDrive services.

SUPERNOVA was publicly disclosed by FireEye23 in December when it 

revealed details of its internal investigation of the compromise by the 

threat group that CTU researchers track as IRON RITUAL. But it was 

only later in December that it became clear24 that SUPERNOVA was in 

fact the work of a different and unrelated group. Then, on December 

24, 2020, SolarWinds confirmed that threat actors had exploited CVE\-

2020\-10148, a SolarWinds Orion API authentication bypass vulnerability 

in its Orion Platform, to deploy SUPERNOVA.

CTU researchers track the operators of the SUPERNOVA web shell 

as BRONZE SPIRAL. The CTU team was initially unable to attribute 

the August activity to any known threat groups. However, similarities 

to the BRONZE SPIRAL intrusion in late 2020 suggest that the same 

threat group was responsible for both intrusions. These include use of 

identical commands, servers, working directories, and compromised 

administrator accounts. 

The threat group also makes extensive use of native system tools and 

‘living off the land’ techniques (see below) to enable long\-term access 

to target networks and theft of intellectual property.

steady level of activity. Mainly this involved espionage and 
surveillance operations against individuals perceived as valuable 
information sources or potential threats to the Iranian regime, such 
as journalists, academics, human rights defenders, and employees 
of government, intergovernmental organizations (IGO), and non\-
governmental organizations (NGO). Iran’s main focus has been the 
Middle East – Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Israel 
in particular – rather than Western organizations, reflecting its 
perception of the chief source of risk to its interests. With the 
election of the new hard\-line president Ebrahim Raisi, its regional 
geographical focus may soon change. 

Iran also carried out cryptographic wiper attacks masquerading 
as ransomware attacks. These primarily focused on Israeli targets 
but similar wiper attacks are also starting to be seen against the 
UAE, likely as a result of the recently formed political links between 
the UAE and Israel. 

In the past year, CTU researchers analyzed incidents including:

• COBALT FOXGLOVE using a compromised Citrix server for 
entry, deploying the Ngrok tunneling tool to add an additional 
access mechanism to the environment. 

• COBALT ULSTER carrying out spear phishing campaigns 

targeting Iraqi and Turkish organizations using humanitarian and 
COVID\-19\-related themes during May and June 2020\.

• COBALT EDGEWATER using employment\-themed lures to 
target entities in Lebanon using MailDropper malware, which 
uses mailboxes to relay C2 messages. A 2020 MailDropper 
campaign used a mailbox at the Lebanese Directorate 
of General Security. Campaigns in 2021 used mailboxes 
associated with the Lebanese Army and a leading Lebanese 
mobile telecom network operator. Threat actors could 
leverage these mailbox compromises to conduct broader 
intrusions into these networks.

Conclusion

CTU researchers also investigated a May 2021 phishing campaign 
carried out by COBALT ILLUSION that used the legitimate 
Dropbox online file\-hosting platform to evade email security 
controls. The campaign involved phishing activity targeting a 
European nation’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, an intergovernmental 
organization (IGO), and government employees in Israel. It is likely 
that other organizations were also targeted. At least one targeted 
individual had prior links to Iran.

COBALT ILLUSION usually follows a well\-worn playbook in its phishing 
operations, appearing to pay limited attention to operational security 
and taking few measures to prevent their infrastructure from being 
identified and tracked. CTU researchers advise that customers who 
think they might be a target of Iranian groups review available log 
data for interactions with COBALT ILLUSION phishing infrastructure. 
Deploying multi\-factor authentication MFA adds additional protection, 
although COBALT ILLUSION has previously attempted to convince 
targets to divulge SMS codes and other multi\-factor tokens to bypass 
this security control.

Several groups have continued Iran’s association 
with wipers and ransomware:

• The ‘PowGoop’ downloader linked to Thanos ransomware 
attacks against state\-run organizations in the Middle East 
showed coding overlaps with tools seen by Secureworks 
during previous incident response engagements involving 
COBALT ULSTER. This raised the possibility that COBALT 
ULSTER could have facilitated the ransomware attacks by 
providing network access to another threat actor. Victims 
included a state\-owned oil and gas producer based in 
Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, and a governmental agency 
in Egypt. If Iranian state\-sponsored actors were involved in 
these incidents, it would suggest the attacks were designed 
more for sabotage than financial gain.

• Analysis of the N3tw0rm ransomware and ransom note 
observed in attacks against Israel in April 2021 indicates 
links to the Pay2Key ransomware, which was used in 2020 
operations that also focused on Israel. CTU researchers link 
Pay2Key to COBALT FOXGLOVE. N3tw0rm attacks use name\-
and\-shame tactics including bulk data theft and publication 
of victim names. The impacted organizations operate in 
Israel in the logistics, retail, and engineering verticals. CTU 
analysis suggests that the targeting is likely opportunistic but 
focused on entities that are geographically located in Israel. 

Although these activities look superficially like ransomware, 
they are probably not what they seem. CTU researchers believe that 
N3tw0rm and Pay2Key are used in Iranian state\-sponsored operations 
but are designed to look like cybercrime attacks to misdirect 
attribution. Any resulting financial gain may be a secondary benefit. 
Low value ransom demands may be designed to encourage victims 
to pay quickly, but the threat actors probably do not plan to provide 
a decryptor. In this model, the threat actors use the ransomware as a 
cryptographic wiper and achieve the dual purpose of data destruction 
and financial gain. A similar approach seems to be in use by the Agrius 
or Black Shadow group that attacked businesses in the insurance and 
finance sectors in Israel in late 2020 and in 2021\. It has also been seen 
using a type of wiper malware previously seen in use by threat actors 
connected with COBALT GYPSY.

Conclusion

Russia

Russian cyber espionage activity has been under the spotlight during 
the period, with IRON HEMLOCK’s network intrusions targeting 
COVID\-19 vaccine development, U.S. indictments against six GRU 
officers associated with the IRON VIKING threat group, and extensive 
media reporting of IRON RITUAL’s SolarWinds supply chain attack. 

Despite the number of headlines, Russian threat group activity 
continues to be narrowly focused against traditional espionage targets 
such as government, non\- and inter\-governmental organizations 
(NGOs and IGOs), policy and think tanks, and related supply chain 
organizations. Nowhere was this better illustrated than with the 
SolarWinds campaign, where CTU researchers observed IRON 
RITUAL deliberately and permanently disabling their own access 
to all Secureworks customers who had downloaded the trojanized 
SolarWinds code, presumably on the basis that they were not deemed 
to be relevant to their goals and they wanted to minimize the chances 
of detection. 

IRON RITUAL itself also carried other, somewhat less sophisticated 
attacks. One example was a U.S. Agency for International Development 
(USAID)\-themed phishing campaign26 targeting governmental, 
non\-governmental organizations (NGOs), and intergovernmental 
organizations (IGOs) based in the United States, Ukraine, and 
the European Union. A second campaign targeted IT companies, 
government bodies, NGOs, think tanks, and financial services in the 
U.S., UK, Germany, Canada, and 32 other countries using password\-
spraying and brute force attacks.

44

2021 State of the Threat: A Year in ReviewHowever, not all Russian threat groups have continued to 

rely on historic tried\-and\-tested techniques. In July 2021, 

U.S. and UK security agencies released a joint advisory29 about IRON 

TWILIGHT’s use of a Kubernetes cluster to conduct distributed brute\-

force attacks against Microsoft 365, on\-premises email servers, and 

other service providers. The use of an attacker\-owned Kubernetes 

cluster is notable, as it offers automation, scalability, and the ability to 

redeploy infrastructure rapidly and easily across various commercial 

providers to evade IP\-based blocking.

Despite similar targets, the TTPs used in these campaigns 
were considerably less sophisticated than those used in the 
SolarWinds campaign and far more easily detected. The USAID 
phishing activity was high volume, noisy, and required a user to 
perform a series of actions before malware could be installed to 
provide ongoing access to the machine. The second campaign 
involved spraying large numbers of username and password 
combinations in an attempt to guess login credentials, and was 
assessed by Microsoft to have been largely unsuccessful.

A lack of subtlety also marked other elements of other Russian 

state\-sponsored activity observed over the period. This included 

IRON LIBERTY27 targeting28 U.S. government and aviation networks 

in September 2020\. Tactics used included brute\-force password 

attacks, SQL injection, domain spoofing of legitimate aviation and 

government organizations, spear phishing, strategic web compromises, 

and harvesting NTLM credentials. Vulnerabilities that were reportedly 

leveraged affected Citrix Netscaler (CVE\-2019\-19781\), Microsoft 

Exchange (CVE\-2020\-0688\), Exim (CVE\-2019\-10149\), Fortinet VPN 

(CVE\-2018\-13379\), and Windows NetLogon (CVE\-2020\-1472\).

2021 State of the Threat: A Year in Review 
 
North Korea

North Korea’s cyber operations continued to gain in sophistication 
over the period, although they still lag behind Russia and China. North 
Korean groups continued to prioritize specific organizations and 
individuals involved in defense, government and security research in 
South Korea and the U.S.. Other targets included those in neighboring 
East Asian countries, especially Japan. The targeting of entities in 
Russia, Israel and India was also observed.

Unlike other nation state cyber operations, North Korea places a 
strong emphasis on revenue generation. This was in evidence before 
the coronavirus pandemic when the country needed to address the 
economic damage caused by UN sanctions in response to North 
Korea’s nuclear weapons program. It is even more of a focus now as 
it deals with the crippling impact of its border closure with China – by 
far its largest trading partner – to limit the spread of the disease. North 
Korean state groups have used ransomware, cryptocurrency thefts and 
manipulation of the global financial system, such as SWIFT, in pursuit of 
topping up ailing state bank accounts. This motivation to make money 

places North Korean targeting more in line with some cybercrime 
groups than other hostile nation states. Companies that are not 
traditional nation\-state APT targets could find themselves in the sights 
of these groups.

Organizations involved in defense research, particularly those in South 
Korea, continue to be a top target for espionage\-focused North 
Korean threat groups. Individual defense contractors have also been 
targeted with lure documents that deploy malware. A campaign by 
the NICKEL ACADEMY group used social engineering techniques to 
target security researchers30, possibly in the hope of obtaining zero\-
day vulnerabilities that could be used in their attacks. 

In late 2020, North Korean groups also targeted31 organizations 
involved in COVID\-19 vaccination research. Based on tactics observed 
by CTU researchers, the NICKEL HYATT, NICKEL ACADEMY, and NICKEL 
KIMBALL threat groups have all been involved in such activity. The 
public position of the North Korean regime is that there have been no

Conclusion

COVID\-19 cases in North Korea, and it has turned down offers 
of vaccines from Russia. However, while some crossover in 
operational objectives between threat groups is expected, efforts by 
these three normally separate groups could indicate that the North 
Korean government set this specific espionage objective as 
an overarching priority.

In one example, Secureworks incident responders found evidence that 
NICKEL HYATT compromised a life sciences company in East Asia in Q3 
2020\. This life sciences company had been known to be working on 
COVID\-19 vaccine development and manufacturing. The threat actors 
obtained initial access by compromising a managed service provider 
and then leveraged a jump host intended for remote administration of 
the network. The intrusion was detected at an early phase, and initial 
data exfiltration was limited to network enumeration\-related log data. 
Tools used during the intrusion included some seen in previous 
NICKEL HYATT engagements as well as others new to our 
observations of their activity.

Cryptocurrency heists were another way for North Korean groups 
to steal money. U.S. authorities reported in February 2021 that North 
Korean threat groups had targeted organizations for cryptocurrency 
theft in over 30 countries in 2020 alone. North Korea has used 
AppleJeus malware disguised as cryptocurrency trading platforms 
since at least 2018 and have also been seen employing TFlower 
ransomware for economic gain.
