About this report 
To help you assess your mobile 
security environment and calibrate 
your defenses, we’ve produced this 
fourth annual Verizon Mobile Security 
Index. To create it, we worked with 
Asavie, Check Point, BlackBerry 
Cylance, IBM, Lookout, MobileIron, 
NetMotion, Netskope, Proofpoint, 
Qualcomm, Thales, VMware and 
Wandera—all leaders in mobile device 
security. They provided additional 
information, including incident and 
usage data. We also commissioned 
an independent survey of 856 
professionals responsible for the 
buying, managing and security of 
mobile and Internet of Things 
(IoT) devices.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI), Europol and the U.S. Secret 
Service also provided valuable input. 
We’d like to thank all our contributors 
for helping us to present a more 
complete picture of the threats that 
affect mobile devices and what is 
being done to mitigate them.
For more information on our survey,

# Foreword
For more than a decade, Verizon has 
published some of the preeminent 
reports on cybersecurity, including 
the Data Breach Investigations 
Report (DBIR). This is the fourth 
edition of the Mobile Security Index. 
As the name suggests, it focuses on 
the threats to mobile devices; what 
defenses companies have in place to 
thwart these attacks; and how often 
those fail, leading to a mobile-related 
compromise.
One of the key themes of the 
2020 Mobile Security Index was 
mal-innovation. We talked about 
how cybercriminals were constantly 
finding new and often imaginative ways 
to carry out attacks. In another life, 
where their motives weren’t nefarious 
and the outcomes not so damaging to 
so many, the creativity and ingenuity 
shown by some of the attackers would 
merit fame and accolades.
Sadly, mal-innovation continues apace, 
and we saw many new examples in 
2020. COVID-19—you didn’t think that 
we’d not mention it, did you?—provided 
cybercriminals with new opportunities. 
Criminals were able to craft tailored 
phishing attacks very quickly. But that’s 
no longer a surprise. It doesn’t take a 
pandemic for phishing gangs to identify 
new ways to exploit human weaknesses 
to further their attacks. 
Another of the key themes of our 2020 
report was how mobile devices are 
not just being used more, but used for 
more. In large part driven by apps and 
data in the cloud, mobile devices have 
evolved from being a handy companion 
into an essential business tool. Today, 
you can buy a watch that has much of 
the functionality smartphones had just 
a couple of years ago. Smartphones, 
tablets and other mobile devices can 
now be used to access core systems, 
edit spreadsheets and perform other 
mission-critical tasks.
Cybersecurity is not a new issue, 
but the stakes are getting higher. 
The scale of regulatory penalties is 
growing, and customers—consumers, 
businesses and public-sector 
organizations alike—are becoming 
more sensitive to the issue. In the past, 
many consumers saw little difference 
between the security postures of 
the companies—such as banks and 
retailers—pursuing their business, and 
so it didn’t sway their loyalty. That’s 
changing, and consequently lots of 
companies are responding by making 
security and data privacy central to 
their value proposition. 
When we asked respondents to our 
latest survey to rate how crucial mobile 
is to their business on a 10-point scale, 
71% answered 8 or higher. But with the 
increased reliance on mobile devices, 
the risk has grown too. Mobile devices 
are subject to all the same risks as 
non-mobile user devices, plus some 
of their own:
> More than three-quarters 
> of companies think that data 
> privacy will be a key brand 
> differentiator in the future.
Amplified risks
Mobile devices can be subject to attacks 
that could happen on any device, but 
sometimes the mobile device makes 
them more likely to be successful.
An example is a phishing attack. Several 
of the ways users spot a malicious email 
or website are less obvious on a small 
screen, meaning users may be more 
likely to fall for an attack. 
Specific risks
Mobile devices are significantly more 
prone to loss and theft. This can lead 
to the exposure of data, but often the 
biggest impact is on productivity.
Because they are often used in 
public places—like trains and coffee 
shops—mobile devices are susceptible 
to eavesdropping, both physical and 
electronic.
Gateway risks
Attackers can exploit mobile devices to 
acquire data from the cloud and other 
systems that they connect to.
They can also be attacked to capture 
credentials, which can then be used to 
gain access to data in other systems.

MSI 2021  Foreword
The findings of this report are based on a survey of 856 professionals 
responsible for the procurement, management or security of mobile 
devices. Unless stated otherwise, quoted statistics are from this survey. 
Other findings are based on data supplied by our contributors: Asavie, 
Check Point, BlackBerry Cylance, IBM, Lookout, MobileIron, NetMotion, 
Netskope, Proofpoint, Qualcomm, Thales, VMware and Wandera.

We couldn’t really write this report without discussing the impact the COVID-19 
pandemic has had on the nature of how we work. The number of remote workers 
has been growing for years, but in many companies—including Verizon—working 
from home went from being the exception to being the rule virtually overnight. 
Unsurprisingly, this led some to cut corners, including on security. Nearly a quarter 
(24%) of respondents to our survey said that their organization had sacrificed the 
security of mobile devices to facilitate their response to restrictions put in place 
due to the pandemic.
Read on to learn more about the mobile security environment and understand 
its risks. We hope that this insight will help you to strengthen your mobile 
security as your digital transformation journey—and evolution to the new world 
of work—unfolds.

The threats are rising.
Two-fifths of respondents said that they think that mobile 
devices are the company’s biggest IT security threat. Of the 
rest, 85% said that mobile devices are at least as vulnerable 
as other IT systems.

Driven by increased 
home working 
A large majority (79%) had seen remote working increase as 
a result of COVID-19. Most (70%) expected remote working 
to fall again, but over three-quarters said that it would remain 
higher than before lockdown.

# The state 
of mobile 
security
01
Each edition of this report has seen the number of 
companies suffering mobile security compromises 
rise. Until now. While this is good news, there are 
many reasons to believe that the picture isn’t as 
rosy as this finding might suggest. More than 
one in five surveyed companies had experienced 
a compromise involving a mobile device in the 
preceding 12 months. And further, the severity 
of the consequences remained high. 
Compromises may 
be down, but the 
threats are growing.
Fewer companies were 
aware of successful 
mobile-related attacks.
This is the fourth year that Verizon 
has published this report. And this 
time the percentage of companies 
that admitted to having suffered a 
mobile-related security compromise 
is the lowest we’ve seen—just 23%.3 
But hold the Champagne. Nearly 
one in four companies suffering a 
mobile device attack is not cause 
for celebration.

5	 Thales Data, Threat Report Global Edition, 2020. Based on research carried out by IDC in November 2019.
By way of comparison, a recent 
report by Thales noted that 26% of 
global respondents had experienced a 
data breach of any kind in the previous 
12 months.5 
One factor affecting these results is 
that the pressure on companies to 
sacrifice security was higher due to 
the measures needed to cope with 
COVID-19. This is highly likely to have 
inflated the sacrifice figures.
Companies were also likely to have 
been distracted. This could mean that 
they haven’t spotted compromises, 
or if they did spot them, they have not 
thoroughly traced them back to identify 
all involved sources.
It’s also likely that cybercriminals were 
still modifying their methods when 
we did our survey. While attacks like 
phishing could continue as normal—and, 
in fact, COVID-19 gave hackers new 
opportunities—these attacks are less 
likely to be traced back to a device type.

*Increased likelihood that an organization that sacrificed security suffered a mobile-related security compromise. For example: Companies that 
sacrificed security in 2021 were 1.5 times as likely to suffer a mobile-related security compromise.
The share of companies sacrificing security went up, but fewer suffered a compromise.

MSI 2021  The state of mobile security
The risks remain high.
Companies see themselves as at risk.
Despite the drop in known compromises, more than one in five companies 
experienced the loss of data or significant disruption to operations, or both. 
Just 14% of respondents thought that there was little or no risk associated with 
mobile devices.
More than two-thirds of respondents said that the risks associated with mobile 
devices had increased in the past year. And half (50%) said that mobile device 
risks are growing faster than others.

Since the first edition of this report,

many companies have had four basic 
protections in place. These precautions 
were chosen based on some of the 
recurring problems identified in our 
sister publication, the Verizon Payment 
Security Report.
Over the years, the share of companies 
in compliance with these protections 
hasn’t changed much. Until now. 
In previous reports, the share of 
companies in compliance with all 
four hovered around 12%, give or take 
1 percentage point (pp). In our latest 
review, just 9% had all of them in place.
Despite not even having some of the 
most basic precautions in place, most 
respondents thought that any security 
or misuse issues would be spotted 
quickly. This mirrors our findings in 
previous years.

Companies remain confident in their defenses.
Despite the risks and numerous indications throughout our survey that 
companies have insufficient defenses in place—both in terms of security solutions 
and processes—companies were confident that they would spot compromises and 
misuse quickly.
This isn’t new; we’ve seen similar confidence in our previous surveys. Nor is the fact 
that despite this, companies realize that they have more to do. In our latest survey, 
81% of respondents agreed that organizations need to take the security of mobile 
devices more seriously.

# Let’s start 
just calling 
it “work.”
02
In the past, working from home was thought of as 
a special case. That attitude had been changing, 
slowly. Then COVID-19 hit and companies 
were forced to reevaluate virtually overnight. 
The shift may not have been through choice, but 
now even some leaders with the most entrenched 
objections to home working have changed their 
minds. It seems that necessity is also the mother 
of evolution. The “new normal” remains uncertain, 
but it’s a safe bet that more flexible working 
arrangements are going to be part of it.
You don’t need a research report 
to tell you that there was a massive 
increase in the number of people 
working from home in 2020. Remote 
working has become commonplace 
and things are unlikely to ever go 
back to the way they were. Numerous 
companies have announced long-
term—or even permanent—work-from-
home policies and plans to reduce their 
property footprint.
Netskope has called this phenomenon 
“inversion.” Its research found that the 
ratio of remote workers to others went 
from one in four at the start of 2020 to 
two out of three by the summer. And 
that pattern continued throughout the 
rest of the year.

Remote working peaked at nearly double, expected to settle at more than 50% up.

This chart isn’t meant as an homage to Joy Division—or the cover of the 2015 DBIR for you fans of our sister publication. Those of you with a knowledge of statistics will 
recognize these as confidence plots. The horizontal center of each curve shows the mean—32% in the pre-lockdown results. As our respondents are just a sample of all 
businesses, the actual average may be different; this is called sampling error. Statistically, we can say that the true number is within the two dotted lines with 95% confidence. 
In this analysis, the potential error is small, around just ±2 percentage points (pp).

to nearly twice as many (62%) during lockdown.
We also asked respondents what they expected this proportion to be once 
COVID-19 is just a memory. A large majority (70%) of those that had seen remote 
working grow following the introduction of restrictions expected it to fall again 
afterward. However, 78% said that it would still remain higher than before lockdown. 
Overall, our respondents said that they expected the number of remote workers to 
settle at around half (49%). 
Interestingly, the difference between small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) 
and enterprises was quite small, just a few percentage points. The biggest 
difference was how much more capable larger companies were of adjusting 
operations to switch employees to working from home. SMBs increased home 
working by 22 pp, enterprises by 32 pp.

MSI 2021  Let’s start just calling it “work.” ﻿
8	 NetMotion, SDP report, June 2020. A survey of over 600 network and IT professionals across the U.S., the U.K. and Australia.
Views on productivity when working 
from home vary by region.
The productivity 
question
Historically, there have been many 
reasons why companies have been 
reluctant to let employees work 
from home. The main reason our 
respondents cited for not enabling 
more staff to work from home was the 
nature of their roles—either there was 
no demand for the role (for example, 
the store, restaurant or other site was 
closed) or the role couldn’t be done 
remotely (for example, production line 
jobs and care workers).
Another reason has been that some 
leaders felt that staff couldn’t—or 
wouldn’t—be as productive working 
remotely. But attitudes are changing. 
Three-fifths (60%) of respondents to 
our survey said that the productivity 
of remote workers was at least as high 
as those onsite. And one in five (20%) 
said that it was significantly higher—
and that was at a time of mass 
disruption, with many people using 
makeshift workstations and a large 
number of parents having to cope with 
challenges like remote schooling.
Enterprises (61%) were more likely 
to say that the productivity of remote 
workers was at least as good, 
compared to SMBs (54%). There was 
more variation by region. It’s tempting 
to try to explain these numbers—and 
with U.S. and U.K. contributors, we 
had some interesting conversations—
but we don’t have the data to confirm 
any hypothesis.
These variances remind us about 
the dangers of averages. Working 
from home is much easier for some 
workers than others. For instance, the 
technology to create virtual call centers 
is well established, and companies with 
adaptable infrastructures were able 
to transition workers quickly. It’s also 
worth noting that some companies 
were able to successfully empower 
staff to work from home, but not in 
their normal role. For instance, when 
its U.S. retail stores were forced to 
close, Verizon was able to retask staff 
to provide online support—which was 
seeing a huge growth in demand.
Not all roles are as easy to shift. Some 
industries, like manufacturing, tend to 
have more of these sorts of roles and 
so faced greater challenges.
Most companies think their workforce is at least as productive 
when working remotely.

Lockdowns adversely affected security.
Security and compliance issues prevented more people from working from home. 
Sales of MDM boomed.

The security question
Nearly all (97%) security leaders 
consider remote workers to be exposed 
to more risk than office workers.9 And 
almost half (49%) said that changes 
during lockdown conditions affected 
mobile security for the worse.
In fact, one in three (33%) respondents 
said that it wasn’t possible to enable 
all the employees to work from home 
that they wanted to due to security or 
compliance issues.
One of the most obvious reactions 
to dealing with the security challenges 
of the increase in home workers 
was the increase in demand for 
mobile device management (MDM). 
Contributors to this report, like IBM, 
MobileIron and Wandera, all reported 
seeing an increase in new license 
sales, and Verizon saw an order-of-
magnitude increase in purchases of 
its MDM solution.
