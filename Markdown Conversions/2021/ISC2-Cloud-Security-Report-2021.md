## INTRODUCTION
Cloud security concerns remain high as the adoption of public cloud computing continues to surge, especially in the wake of the 2020 COVID crisis and the resulting accelerated shift to remote work environments.

The 2021 Cloud Security Report has been produced by Cybersecurity Insiders to explore how organizations are responding to the evolving security threats in the cloud and the continued shortfall of qualified security staff.

Key survey findings include:
- Despite rapid adoption of cloud computing, security remains a primary issue for cloud customers. Virtually all surveyed cybersecurity professionals (96%) confirm they are at least moderately concerned about public cloud security, a small increase from last year’s survey.
- We asked survey participants about the biggest barriers holding back faster cloud adoption. Among the key barriers to cloud adoption, organizations mention lack of qualified staff (39%) as the biggest impediment to faster adoption, followed by data security issues (34%) and legal & regulatory compliance (32%).
- A majority of organizations (57%) expect their cloud security budget to increase over the next 12 months. On average, organizations allocate 28% of their security budget to cloud security.
- We asked organizations how they would rate their overall security readiness. A majority of 73% rate their security readiness average or below average. Only half as many say they are above average (27%).
- As in previous years, the continuing shortage of not only qualified cybersecurity staff but also the lack of security awareness and skills among all employees remains the number one security challenge for organizations. To alleviate this shortage, cybersecurity professionals agree that 6 out of 10 employees would benefit from security training and/or certification for their jobs.

Many thanks to (ISC)2  for supporting this important research project. We hope you find this report informative and helpful as you continue your efforts in securing your cloud environments.

## SECURITY IN PUBLIC CLOUDS
Despite rapid adoption of cloud computing, security remains a key issue for cloud customers. Virtually all surveyed cybersecurity professionals (96%) confirm they are at least moderately concerned about public cloud security, a small increase from last year’s survey.

Cloud users are particularly concerned with risks arising from misconfiguration of the cloud platform, exfiltration of sensitive data, and unauthorized access (see page 8).

How concerned are you about the security of public clouds?
![Chart showing 96% of organizations are moderately to extremely concerned about cloud security. 23% are extremely concerned, 41% are very concerned, 32% are moderately concerned, 3% are slightly concerned, and 1% are not at all concerned.]
96%
Of organizations are moderately to extremely concerned about cloud security.

## CLOUD SECURITY CONFIDENCE
The heightened concerns about cloud security have a negative impact on organizations’ confidence in their own cloud security posture. A majority of organizations are at best only moderately confident in their cloud security posture (72% - up from 66% in last year’s survey). While confidence has been declining over time, we still see an alarming degree of overconfidence not supported by the backdrop of security incidents and challenges presented in this report.

The biggest challenges causing loss of confidence in cloud security include concerns around data loss/leakage, data privacy/confidentiality, and accidental exposure of credentials (see page 5).

How confident are you in your organization’s cloud security posture?
![Chart showing 72% of organizations are not at all confident to moderately confident in their cloud security posture. 6% are extremely confident, 22% are very confident, 52% are moderately confident, 8% are slightly confident, and 12% are not at all confident.]
72%
Of organizations are not at all confident to moderately confident in their cloud security posture.

## CLOUD SECURITY CONCERNS
While cloud providers offer increasingly robust security measures as part of their cloud services, it is the customer who is ultimately responsible for securing their workloads in the cloud. The most significant cloud security challenges highlighted in our survey are unchanged from last year: data loss/leakage (64% - down five percentage points since last year), data privacy/confidentiality (62% - down four percentage points), and accidental exposure of credentials (46% - up two percentage points).

What are your biggest cloud security concerns?
![Chart showing the biggest cloud security concerns. 64% data loss/leakage, 62% data privacy/confidentiality, 46% accidental exposure of credentials, 44% incident response, 40% legal and regulatory compliance, 38% data sovereignty/residency/control, 36% visibility & transparency.
