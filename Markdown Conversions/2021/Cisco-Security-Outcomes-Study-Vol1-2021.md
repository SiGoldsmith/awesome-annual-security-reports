The 2021 Security Outcomes Study
Poised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security Program

When we set out to develop this study, our main goal was to provide a practical 
tool for you, the security leader, to guide your investments, propel you to achieve 
success in your security program, and better manage risk.

With a global representation (25 countries and over 4,800 respondents), we aim 
to empirically measure what factors drive the best security outcomes. This is quite 
different than what we have created in the past in our Cybersecurity Report Series, 
and we hope that this new approach and tone is refreshing and welcomed.

As we know, security is ever evolving to the point that success can sometimes 
feel elusive. So we set out to answer some questions in this study: How can 
we efficiently and effectively manage our cybersecurity risk? How is it that 
even the largest companies with the biggest security budgets still struggle to 
achieve certain outcomes? With all the various options out there for achieving 
a successful cybersecurity program, which ones should practitioners focus on? 
New technology? More training? Better incident response procedures? The 
possibilities are endless. How can a security team determine what will work 
best? And what’s to say that won’t change? (Spoiler alert, it will.) 

This study will provide you with an extra boost of insight and confidence to get 
focused for 2021 and beyond. The past year has been challenging – even more so 
than usual, but there are always steps that can be taken to progress your security 
strategy. Read on to find out which actions may work best for your organization.

**About the survey**

**Sampling**
Cisco contracted a survey 
research firm, YouGov, to field 
a fully anonymous (source and 
respondent) survey that ran 
during the middle of 2020.

**Respondents**
We surveyed over 4,800 
active IT, security, and 
privacy professionals from 
25 countries. Sample 
demographics including 
industries, company size, 
and region can be found in 
Appendix A.

**Analysis**
The Cyentia Institute conducted 
an independent analysis of 
the survey data on behalf of 
Cisco and generated all results 
presented in this study.

**Approach**

*   We asked respondents about their organization’s adherence to 25 security practices 
spanning governance, strategy, spending, architecture, and operations.
*   We then asked about each program’s level of success across roughly a dozen high-level 
security objectives or outcomes organized into three main categories: Enabling the Business, 
Managing Risk, and Operating Efficiently.
*   Next, we conducted extensive multivariate analysis to identify security practices that correlate 
strongly with successful program-level outcomes.

# Introduction

To bring this report to life, we’ve worked closely with many experts 
around the world, including our CISO Advisory team. If you need any extra 
incentive to read on, here’s a quote to get you inspired:

in your swag bag and ignore; this 
is a report to cuddle up with and 
read over and over again. In fact, this 
report will change how we think about 
running infosec programs. ”

# Key Findings

**Is there evidence that security practices 
actually do affect program-level outcomes?**

Out of the 275 practice-outcome combinations, 45% 
show significant correlation – meaning a specific practice 
affected the likelihood of achieving a certain outcome.

**The strongest correlation of them all?**

A proactive, best-of-breed tech refresh strategy allows 
you to keep up with business growth.

**What about the second strongest correlation?**

A well-integrated tech stack improves recruitment and 
retention of security talent.

**Want to achieve overall program success?**

Devote resources to proactive tech refresh and integrate 
your technology. 

**Want a strong security culture that’s 
embraced by all?**

Focus on good equipment, clear direction, accurate alerts, 
and timely fixes of security issues.

**Want to avoid future incidents and losses?** 

Conduct after-action reviews of major incident 
response operations. 

**Which security practices are most difficult 
to implement?** 

Across all 25 practices, those in the architecture and 
operations category appear most challenging to do well.

**Where are programs most successful? 
Where do they struggle the most?**

Programs are most successful in meeting compliance 
regulations. They struggle the most with avoiding 
unplanned work and wasted effort.

**Which function of the NIST Cybersecurity 
Framework contributes most to success?** 

The Identify function ranks #1. The Protect function ranks 
next to last for contributing to a program’s overall success.

**How did organizations minimize the 
impact of COVID-19 on operations?** 

They maintained a modern IT and security 
infrastructure, invested in role-based training, 
and kept top executives informed.

# Where are we going?
## Security Program Outcomes

Many security studies (and programs) start by focusing on what we’re doing rather 
than where we’re headed. But a successful security program isn’t just a set of 
directions; it’s a journey toward a destination. And understanding where we are on 
the journey helps put everything else in proper perspective. 

We’ve started with an admittedly difficult task — identifying a set of diverse, program-level 
objectives and related outcomes that security leaders desire to achieve. These outcomes 
are an aspirational “security destination” so to speak, even if we know we’ll never quite get 
to this ideal. Every security leader and program is different, so we’re certain you’ll think of 
various additions and modifications to our proposed list based on your own use cases. At 
the same time, we hope you’ll agree that they’re a reasonable and relevant set of strategic 
outcomes that lay a solid foundation for framing out this study.

Survey respondents were asked to consider and rate how their organization is 
performing for each outcome in Table 1 on a scale of ‘struggling’ to ‘succeeding.’ We 
recognize that subjective, abstract concepts like ‘keeping up with the demands of 
the business’ can be difficult to grasp and rate, so we presented respondents with 
example evidence for each outcome to guide their assessment (see Appendix B).

**Table 1: Security program outcomes used in this study**

| Objective: Enabling the Business | Objective: Managing Risk | Objective: Operating Efficiently |
| :------------------------------ | :----------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| • Keeping up with the demands and growth of the business (EB1) | • Managing the top cyber risks to the organization (MR1) | • Running a cost-effective security program (OP1) |
| • Gaining the confidence and trust of executive leadership (EB2) | • Meeting regulatory compliance requirements (MR2) | • Minimizing unplanned work and wasted effort (OP2) |
| • Obtaining buy-in from peers and other organizational units (EB3) | • Avoiding major security incidents and losses (MR3) | • Recruiting and retaining talented security personnel (OP3) |
| • Creating a security culture embraced by all employees (EB4) |  | • Streamlining incident detection and response processes (OP4) |

Moving beyond context and caveats, let’s get back to the question at hand — where 
on their journey towards a successful security program are the 4,800 organizations 
represented in this study? Figure 1 shows the percentage of firms that say their 
security program is successfully achieving each respective outcome in our list. So, 
roughly 48% of organizations look to be meeting compliance requirements, 46% are 
gaining executive confidence, and so on, down to the 36% who say their programs 
are minimizing unplanned work.

The overall rate of success at the program level is 42%, which we can’t help 
but notice also happens to be The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the 
Universe, and Everything. Coincidence? We think not, which is why we pivoted 
the entire figure around outcomes exhibiting a success rate above and below 
42%. This format helps draw out the consensus among respondents as to which 
outcomes are easier to achieve (those toward the top) and which are more 
difficult (toward the bottom).

**Figure 1: Percent of respondents reporting their firm is succeeding in each security outcome**

*A bar chart showing the percentage of respondents reporting their firm is succeeding in each security outcome. The chart is ordered from highest to lowest percentage, with the mean percentage of 42% marked. The outcomes are grouped into three categories: Enabling business, Managing risk, and Operating efficiently. The outcomes are: Meeting compliance regs (47.9%), Gaining exec confidence (46.3%), Avoiding major incidents (43.4%), Keeping up w/ business (42.6%), Managing top risks (42.3%), Streamlining IR processes (42.2%), Creating security culture (42.1%), Running cost-effectively (42.0%), Retaining security talent (41.3%), Obtaining peer buy-in (36.4%), Minimizing unplanned work (35.5%).*

The ‘maintaining compliance’ and ‘minimizing unplanned work’ are polar opposites 
on this chart. This won’t come as a shock to the many security professionals who 
see so-called “checkbox compliance” as the epitome of an inefficient security 
program. And it hints at the inherent trade-offs that exist when pursuing objectives 
like those we show here. We’ll revisit the notion of trade-offs later when we 
identify program success factors. 

The categorical overlay adds another interesting dimension to Figure 1. It’s 
apparent that outcomes within the ‘Managing Risk’ objective tend to be perceived 
as less difficult, while those falling under ‘Operating Efficiently’ are more difficult. 
Outcomes associated with ‘Enabling the Business’ run the gamut. 

Anyone responsible for leading a cybersecurity program knows that it’s not easy 
to manage cyber risk well AND do so with minimal cost. Given the choice, most 
organizations take the risk-averse route of spending more to maximize risk reduction.

# What are we doing?
## Security Practices

We now examine what organizations are doing to meet the objectives discussed in the 
previous section. To do this, we asked respondents about a set of 25 security practices at 
their organizations. These practices were drawn from several standards, such as the NIST 
Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), and were organized into the categories of Business and 
Governance, Strategy and Spending, and Architecture and Operations. Like the outcomes, 
these practices are intended to be representative rather than exhaustive. You’ll find 
the complete list of practices that fall under each of these categories in Appendix C.

Figure 2 ranks all practices according to the percentage of respondents who strongly 
believe their organization is following the tenets of each respective practice. We think the 
ratings depicted in the chart are rather optimistic, but we won’t quibble over that because 
the adoption of controls and maturity of a cybersecurity program aren’t the focus of this 
study. We’re much more interested in how (perceived) security practices relate to the 
(perceived) outcomes from the previous section. But we’re not quite ready to go there yet. 

**Figure 2: Percent of respondents who strongly agree their firm follows each security practice**

*A bar chart showing the percentage of respondents who strongly agree their firm follows each security practice. The chart is ordered from highest to lowest percentage, with the mean percentage of 42.3% marked. The practices are grouped into three categories: Business/governance, Strategy/spending, and Architecture/operations. The practices are: Security important to execs (51.4%), Someone owns compliance (49.7%), Understand security & business (48.3%), Clear reporting to execs (46.4%), Identify top cyber risks (45.3%), Accurate asset inventory (44.2%), Security measures reviewed (43.5%), Role-specific training (43.8%), Security awareness training (43.1%), IT & security work together (43.1%), Sufficient security tech (43.4%), Sufficient security budget (42.4%), Sound security strategy (42.0%), Sufficient security staff (41.4%), Secure development approach (41.0%), Learn from prior incidents (40.7%), Proactive tech refresh (40.6%), Manage vendor security (40.5%), Timely incident response (39.9%), Program performance metrics (39.3%), Prompt disaster recovery (38.3%), Use automation effectively (37.8%), Vuln remediation deadlines (37.8%), Well-integrated tech (37.4%), Accurate threat detection (35.9%).*

We first want to highlight the relative difference among these security practices. 
The format is the same as that used for outcomes in Figure 1 and pivots around the 
average level of implementation observed across all controls (42.3%). Those at the 
top are purportedly easier for firms to implement, while those on the bottom appear 
more difficult. We’ll leave you to pick out specific practices of interest and we’ll limit 
commentary to a few high-level observations. 

Once again, we find the contrasting poles to be a fascinating glimpse into the diverse 
nature of security programs. Security professionals used to have to fight hard for 
executive attention and support, but respondents indicate that we’ve come a long 
way in that regard. On the other hand, some of the fundamentals that the industry has 
been working on forever, such as threat detection and vulnerability remediation, 
remain a challenge for many organizations. This is a good reminder that “getting 
back to the basics” isn’t quite as simple as it sounds. 

Looking more broadly at Figure 2, we see a general pattern of business and 
governance factors at the top, strategy in the middle, and architecture and operations 
at the bottom. The interpretation of that pattern goes deeper than simply “governance 
is easy; tech is hard.” This likely reflects dependencies between these categories — i.e., 
you can’t do the stuff at the bottom well without proper governance and strategy. But 
there’s also the reality that most security incidents have some element of architectural 
or operational problems at their root. It’s hard to do all the things well all of the time.

**Looking for some quick wins?**

We ran some additional analysis comparing the relative difficulty of the 
practices depicted in Figure 2 and their correlation with the outcomes listed in 
Figure 1. Our goal was to find practices that aren’t too hard to implement, yet 
contribute strongly to security program success. Learn more about those quick 
wins in our #SecurityOutcomes blog series.

# How do we get there?
## Identifying Success Factors

We’ve considered where we want our security programs to go and what we’re 
currently doing. Now it’s time to figure out exactly how to achieve those outcomes. Our 
overarching question is simple: What contributes to a successful security program? 

Since a security program is a complex, inter-dependent system, we analyzed all 
practices and outcomes to identify relationships among them. For each practice-
outcome combination, we calculated the change in probability of achieving 
outcomes associated with higher levels of adherence to various security practices. 
This approach allowed us to derive statistically-sound answers to questions like:

*   Is there evidence that better security practices correlate with better outcomes?
*   Which practices contribute most strongly to successful security outcomes?
*   What are the most effective practices for achieving each specific outcome?
*   How much more likely are you to achieve x if you do y?

Some may see these as simple questions with simple answers. But is that really 
the case? The security industry uses many best practices as part of its overall 
strategy. Yet we don’t always measure how well those practices work, and 
correlate them with desired outcomes.

**No really — how did you correlate practices 
and outcomes?**

> Statistics! Many of you may fall asleep (or have recurring nightmares) 
after reading this, but the answer is careful, rigorous statistics. In particular, 
we utilize multivariate generalized linear models to understand the effects 
of each practice on each outcome. That is, we create a logistic regression 
where each outcome variable is the dependent variable and all the factors 
are independent variables. This allows us to test when factors make a 
statistically significant difference and when we might be just seeing the 
correlation by chance.
>
> For all you nerds out there, we also go a step further. As you might 
remember, the regression coefficients for factors in a logistic regression 
don’t quite directly translate to a change in probability. But with a handy 
little technique called “Average Marginal Effects” we can figure out how 
much an organization might gain from each factor. The well-known adage 
“correlation isn’t causation” still applies, but this approach effectively 
spotlights potentially useful practice-outcome associations to consider.

### Overall Program Success

Let’s start by isolating the ‘overall program success’ outcome because it encompasses 
all others. Figure 3 lists factors from top to bottom based on their strength of correlation 
with the respondent claiming to have a highly successful security program overall. The 
bars and values indicate the expected increase in probability of overall program success 
associated with each practice. Because of statistical variation, that increase is expressed 
as a range of probability. The middle value marks the average (and most likely) increase 
in the likelihood of program success.

According to these results, organizations wanting to maximize the overall success of 
their security program should ideally start with a modern, well-integrated tech stack. 
Most respondents who said their firm’s tech refresh strategy emphasizes proactive 
refreshes using best-of-breed IT and security technologies are 11% to 15% more likely 
to report successful programs (12.7% on average). Conversely, those who indicated 
that their firms rarely upgrade infrastructure or only do so when things break showed 
significantly reduced rates of success. Ensuring that technologies work well together as 
an integrated defense increases overall success by an average of about 11%.[1](#footnote1)

**Figure 3: Practices most strongly correlated with overall security program success**

*A bar chart showing the practices most strongly correlated with overall security program success. The chart is ordered from highest to lowest average increase in probability of success. The practices are grouped into three categories: Architecture/operations, Business/governance, and Strategy/spending. The practices are: Proactive tech refresh (12.7%), Well-integrated tech (10.5%), Sound security strategy (6.1%), Timely incident response (4.8%), Program performance metrics (3.6%), Clear reporting to execs (3.1%), IT & security work together (3.0%). The bars show the range of probability increase.*

We fully realize this finding seems suspiciously convenient for a company offering 
technologies fitting this description, so we’ll take this opportunity to reiterate that 
a professional survey company (YouGov) conducted this survey, participants didn’t 
know Cisco was involved, and an independent research firm (Cyentia Institute) 
analyzed the data. We’re pleased these results validate Cisco’s strategy and 
solutions portfolio, but we played no part in deriving them.

> Figure 3 shows the change in probability of overall program success as a 
range. Read it like this: “A proactive tech refresh strategy increases the chance 
of reporting a successful security program by roughly 11% to 15%, with an 
average of 12.7%.” Every chart like this can be interpreted in the same fashion.

[1](#footnote1)It should be noted that the probabilities associated with practice-outcome combinations cannot be added together. So, 
we cannot say that proactive tech refreshes AND well-integrated tech up the success rate by 23.2% (12.7% + 10.5%). 

13
The 2021 Security Outcomes Study
Poised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security Program

We realize that a proactive tech refresh strategy isn’t always that easy for some 
organizations. Some don’t have the budget; some need to focus their resources and 
efforts elsewhere for various legitimate reasons. The good news is that these results 
DO NOT relegate such organizations to certain failure. It simply means they need to 
identify alternate success factors that work for their situation. That’s exactly what we 
hope this analysis helps them do. 

After all, having a sufficient security budget was one of the factors we tested, but it did 
not significantly correlate with overall program success. So good security isn’t 
just about the money. Moving beyond the top two factors in Figure 3, it’s great to 
see measurable benefits tied to having a sound security strategy. That’s something 
organizations of all types and sizes can develop. Everything else flows from it.

It’s often said that what makes great leaders is the way they respond to a crisis. 
Figure 3 says that’s a big part of what makes a great security program too. A timely 
incident response requires thorough preparation, smart tools, and tested processes. 
If you need some justification to improve those capabilities, this chart should help. 
The next two success factors go hand-in-hand. Using performance metrics to drive 
operations, and then clearly reporting that information to executive leadership, contributes 
significantly to program success. This is the core of the OODA loop, and it works.

And that brings us to the last of the success factors — IT, development, and security teams 
working together. No, we don’t mean some kind of corporate retreat trust fall exercise 
while “Imagine” plays in the background. This factor points to the fact that you can’t do 
security well if you can’t do IT and development well (and vice versa). And if that’s true, 
doesn’t it make sense to communicate and collaborate so everyone’s more successful? 
Figure 3 shows there’s a benefit to forging strong alliances across the organizational aisle.

One final thing to note is that the top overall success factors span all categories – 
operations, governance, and strategy. This suggests that a great security program 
can’t be built solely upon great governance or great strategy or great operations. 
A winning program requires all of these elements, and the more you do, the better 
you do. That theme will continue to reveal itself throughout the next few sections 
as we explore success factors for each of the 11 program-level outcomes.

> What appears to be a strong 
correlation between continually 
upgrading your tech and program 
success may spell bad news for 
organizations that use technology like 
furniture – meaning it sticks around 
until it breaks. This indicates that 
“newer is better” isn’t just a lifestyle 
choice spawned from Silicon Valley.

### Meeting Security Objectives

Having a security program that is successful overall is a worthy goal, but it’s also 
perfectly reasonable (and often necessary) to pursue specific outcomes. Perhaps 
you looked at the list of outcomes in Table 1 and thought, “I wonder what factors 
would help us achieve [x outcome]?” If so, this section is for you. 

Outcomes are organized into the three categories of: Enabling the Business, 
Managing Risk, and Operating Efficiently. Under those headings, we provide 
several security practices that correlate most strongly with respondents asserting 
their programs are successfully achieving each objective. Those wanting the full 
list of success factors for any given outcome should sit tight for just a bit; we have 
something special for you later in the report.

The four practices of Proactive tech refresh (SS6), Well-integrated tech 
(AO1), Timely incident response (AO9), and Prompt disaster recovery (AO10) 
significantly contribute to nearly every outcome. Thus, they’re very common 
across all charts in this section. As a way of diversifying insights, we generally 
focus observations on the top five practices for each outcome besides those 
four. Please do not take that as us de-emphasizing their importance. There’s 
a strong case that they’re THE most important success factors in this study. 

**NIST CSF Functions**

> Beyond adherence to specific practices, we also asked respondents about 
where their security programs place the greatest priority in terms of investment, 
resources, and effort. We used the high-level security functions defined in the 
NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) for this.
>
> While the CSF’s Protect function isn’t at the bottom for every outcome, it ranks 
next to last for contributing to the overall success of the security program 
(Identify ranks #1). That’s certainly counterintuitive, but we don’t see this as 
suggesting protection isn’t important. Rather, it indicates that the best programs 
invest in a well-rounded set of defenses to identify, protect, detect, respond, 
and recover from cyber threats. The field has long been protection-heavy; this 
says that protection alone is not the most effective strategy.

functions contribute to program outcomes.

of different tools from multiple 
vendors, and generally have to use 
a fair amount of duct tape to get 
them to work together. This creates 
complexity, cost, and overhead.”

#### Enabling Business

As the label implies, outcomes in this section focus on the security program’s 
mission of supporting and fostering business activities. This category recognizes that 
security doesn’t exist for security’s sake; it serves the business. Let’s see if we can 
find tips on how to accomplish that.

##### Keeping up with the demands and growth of the business

Frequently upgrading to the best available technologies and integrating them to 
work well together both feature prominently again in Figure 4. Since we’ve already 
discussed those practices quite a bit, we’ll simply note that this finding makes a 
lot of sense to us. The whole notion of ‘keeping up with the business’ means that 
security must move, change, and adapt along with revenue-generating activities. 
Anyone who’s tried to teach old tech new tricks knows that it’s nearly impossible. 
Outdated, fragmented infrastructure hinders the business, period.

The strong link between role-specific security training and enabling the business is 
music to our ears. In fact, we made it into a maxim: “Adept people, agile program.” 
Some might argue that this is one of the most fundamental themes in modern 
security programs. Effective training must be of high quality, consistent with the 
culture of the business, and tailored for specific audiences.

**Figure 4: Top security success factors for keeping up with the business (EB1)**

*A bar chart showing the top security success factors for keeping up with the business. The chart is ordered from highest to lowest average increase in probability of success. The practices are grouped into two categories: Architecture/operations, and Strategy/spending. The practices are: Proactive tech refresh (8.9%), Role-specific training (6.1%), Use automation effectively (6.0%), Well-integrated tech (5.2%), Timely incident response (5.6%), Program performance metrics (5.1%), Vuln remediation deadlines (3.9%), Sufficient security budget (3.9%). The bars show the range of probability increase.*

The inclusion of automation in Figure 4 also makes sense to us. Automation helps 
the security program keep up with the business by eliminating bottlenecks and 
raising agility across people, processes, and technology. The emphasis on tech 
modernization, automation, and integration in Figure 4 starts to take on a distinctly 
DevSecOps appeal.

It may seem odd at first to see incident response (IR) listed as a top business 
enabler. But IR isn’t just about putting out fires and cleaning up the mess. It’s 
ultimately about handling unexpected events with minimal impact to the business. 
And in that light, it makes perfect sense that it makes the cut in Figure 4.

18
The 2021 Security Outcomes Study
Poised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security Program

Ostensibly, a metrics-driven security program is one that’s used to adjust course in 
response to changing conditions. We suspect that’s why performance metrics make 
the list for helping security keep pace with the business. There’s no sense in moving 
quickly if you’re not sure where you are or where you’re going.

It’s no surprise that having a sufficient budget helps the security program keep up 
with the business. This is worth remembering, especially if your business model 
involves moving fast and evolving quickly. Proper investments in security show 
promise for aiding that momentum.

##### Gaining the confidence and trust of executive leadership

Score another point for modern, integrated tech. We can’t help but think of executive 
SOC visits here (and have a sudden urge to clean our desk and look busy), but at least 
there’s some evidence that the "tech tour" song and dance really does work!

Many C-Suite executives view cybersecurity as insurance against landing their 
company in the headlines for a major breach or business interruption. Those fears 
may be why accurate threat detection and prompt disaster recovery rise high among 
factors that correlate with gaining executive confidence. Being able to demonstrate 
strong visibility and resilience communicates “we got this” to leadership.

**Figure 5: Top security success factors for gaining executive confidence (EB2)**

*A bar chart showing the top security success factors for gaining executive confidence. The chart is ordered from highest to lowest average increase in probability of success. The practices are grouped into three categories: Architecture/operations, Business/governance, and Strategy/spending. The practices are: Accurate threat detection (6.6%), Proactive tech refresh (6.5%), Well-integrated tech (6.0%), Security important to execs (5.2%), Prompt disaster recovery (5.2%), Program performance metrics (4.8%), Accurate asset inventory (4.9%), Role-specific training (3.9%). The bars show the range of probability increase.*

Having an accurate asset inventory, program performance metrics, and role-specific 
training seem to continue the theme of assuaging executives’ fears. Demonstrating 
that the security team knows where the crown jewels are located, has the skills to 
defend them, and tracks credible metrics to back up the “we got this” message 
goes a long way toward earning trust at the top. 

Security being important to execs and gaining their confidence seems rather 
tautological. This is probably a good example of the “correlation isn’t causation” 
adage. If security is important to them, they’re likely supporting the program 
sufficiently and invested in its success.

##### Obtaining buy-in from peers and other organizational units

Several of the top success factors in Figure 6 we’ve seen and discussed before. But 
it’s still helpful to see that good security operations (namely detection, integration, and 
automation) help earn respect and participation from other teams/divisions. You could 
even argue that they’re dependent upon those other teams. These practices reduce 
friction, increase flexibility, and generally help the security program shed its stigma as 
the “Department of No”.

**Figure 6: Top security success factors for obtaining peer buy-in (EB3)**

*A bar chart showing the top security success factors for obtaining peer buy-in. The chart is ordered from highest to lowest average increase in probability of success. The practices are grouped into two categories: Architecture/operations, and Strategy/spending. The practices are: Accurate threat detection (6.0%), Well-integrated tech (5.7%), Use automation effectively (5.2%), Sufficient security budget (4.9%), Vuln remediation deadlines (4.6%), Sufficient security staff (4.7%). The bars show the range of probability increase.*

Speaking of stigmas, it’s not uncommon that security-related spending hits the 
budgets of IT and development organizations (sometimes harder than they’d like). 
This may be why giving the security program a sufficient budget of its own helps 
with peer buy-in. That same idea is likely why having adequate security staff makes 
the list. “Oh, I don’t have to pay for it or take my people away from what they’re 
doing? Then sure, we’ll participate — thanks!”

Vulnerability remediation is a concrete example of the dynamic described in the previous 
paragraph. It’s rarely done without collaboration between IT and security teams. Security 
often finds the bugs, while IT squashes them. It’s easy to see why coordinating 
who’s doing what engenders better cooperation among interdepartmental peers.

Poised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security Program

##### Creating a security culture embraced by all employees

How do you create a security culture that’s actually embraced rather than eschewed by 
employees? Figure 7 places the following at the top of the list: giving them good tech 
that meets their needs, a clear sense of direction, and timely fixes when things break (or 
keeping them from breaking in the first place). It’s hard to argue with that message.

Culture doesn’t simply mean training, especially the annual online awareness kind that 
everyone hates. And it certainly doesn’t mean ‘every time you violate a security policy, 
we’ll punish you by making you go through that training again.’ The strategy-culture 
correlation is worth calling out specifically. This is the only outcome in the ‘Enabling 
the Business’ category for which having a sound security strategy significantly 
increases the probability of success. That may seem odd, but consider that many 
a frustrated employee has asked something to the effect of “why do we have to go 
through all of this?” in response to new security policies. A good strategy eases that 
frustration by getting everyone on the same page.
