2021 STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN REPORT
Introduction
In 1849, French writer Jean\-Baptiste Alphonse Karr 
famously said, “the more things change, the more 
they stay the same.” While he obviously wasn’t 
talking about open source software (OSS), digital 
supply chains, or application innovation during 
a global pandemic, he might as well have been. 
Indeed, in the year since we last published our 
State of the Software Supply Chain research, so 
much has changed in the world of software devel\-
opment, and yet, so much has stayed the same.
My oh my, how things have changed. COVID\-19 fun\-
damentally transformed how people live and work, 
how companies interact with customers, how custom\-
ers shop and buy, and how physical and digital 
supply chains function. As the economic importance 
of digital innovation accelerated during the global 
pandemic, so too did the number of cyber\-attacks 
aimed at exploiting software supply chains.
And yet, much has stayed the same. Top\-
performing companies like Apple, Goldman Sachs, 
and Amazon — and more recently, Zoom, Peloton, 
and Wayfair have mastered three key competitive 
advantages: knowing how to use open source and 
third\-party innovation at scale, integrating security 
and risk controls into multiple phases of the 
software supply chain, and releasing higher quality 
code faster than their competitors.
Now in its seventh year, Sonatype’s 2021 State 
of the Software Supply Chain Report blends a 
broad set of public and proprietary data to reveal 
important findings.
Together with our partners, we are proud to share 
this research. We hope that you find it valuable.
Open source 
supply is accelerating. 
The top four open source 
ecosystems released a 
combined 6,302,733 new 
versions and introduced 
723,570 brand new 
projects. Collectively, 
these communities now 
contain a combined 
37,451,682 different 
versions of components, 
representing a 20% year 
over year (YoY) growth 
in global supply of open 
source. 
Open source 
demand is exploding. 
In 2021 developers around the 
world will request more than 2\.2 
trillion open source packages 
from these same four ecosys\-
tems, representing a 73% Y
o
Y 
growth in developer downloads 
of open source components. 
Despite the growing volume of 
downloads, the percentage of 
available components utilized 
in production applications is 
shockingly low.
Open source vulnerabilities are most 
pervasive in popular projects. 
29% of popular projects contain at least one known security vulnerabil\-
ity. Conversely, only 6\.5% of non\-popular projects do so. This dichotomy 
suggests that the vast majority of security research (blackhat and 
whitehat) is focused on finding and reporting vulnerabilities in projects 
that are most commonly utilized.

2021 STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN REPORT
Some projects are 
better than others. 
To avoid stale dependencies 
and minimize security risks 
associated with third\-party 
open source, software 
engineering teams should 
actively embrace projects that 
consistently demonstrate low 
mean time to update (MTTU) 
values and high OpenSSF 
Criticality scores.
Dependency management practices 
vary widely among teams. 
On average, enterprise Java applications utilize 10% of 
the components that are available for download in the 
Maven Central Repository. However commercial engi\-
neering teams actively update only 25% of components 
utilized. Such efforts 
are highly variable and 
frequently suboptimal, 
yet there is wisdom in 
the crowd that can be 
distilled. Newer 
versions of projects 
are generally better, 
but not always best.
Standardizing 
architectural guidance 
is a path to huge 
efficiency gains. 
Intelligent automation that 
standardizes engineering 
teams on exemplary open 
source projects could 
remove 1\.6M hours and 
$240M of real world waste 
spread across our sample 
of 100,0001 production 
applications. Extrapolated 
out to the entire software 
industry, the associated 
savings would be billions.
Supply chain attacks are 
increasing exponentially.
 In 2021 the world witnessed a 650% 
increase in software supply chain attacks, 
aimed at exploiting weaknesses in 
upstream open source ecosystems. For 
perspective, the same statistic was 430% 
in the 2020 version of the report.

There is a disconnect between subjective survey 
feedback and objective data. 
People believe they are doing a good job remediating defective components 
and indicate that they understand where risk resides. Objectively, research 
shows development teams lack structured guidance and frequently make 
suboptimal decisions with respect to software supply chain management.

CHAPTER 1
Open Source Supply, 
Demand, and Security
The universal desire for faster innovation funda\-
mentally requires that software developers reuse 
code frequently and efficiently. This, in turn, has led 
to a critical dependence on OSS libraries borrowed 
from third\-party ecosystems. These third\-party 
components and packages represent the building 
blocks of modern software development. But, what 
does open source supply look like? What are the 
demand dynamics? What is the relative quality and 
security of third\-party code borrowed from open 
source suppliers?
Figure 1\.1 summarizes statistics on supply, 
demand, usage, and security for the Java, 
JavaScript, Python, and .NET ecosystems. There 
are an order of magnitude more project versions 
than there are projects, with the average project 
having published eight to 12 versions, depending 
on the ecosystem. Older projects can have tens, 
or even hundreds of versions. Furthermore, 
a minefield of known (and unknown) security 
risks lurk within the 37 million available project 
versions. Such risk is far more prominent in 
popular projects. 
Open Source Supply
The global supply of open source libraries contin\-
ues to grow exponentially, fueled by new versions 
of existing projects constantly being released, 
and by the creation of altogether new projects. 
Currently, the top four open source ecosystems 
contain a combined 37,451,682 components and 
packages. These same communities released a 
combined 6,302,733 new versions of components / 
packages over the past year and have introduced 
723,570 brand new projects in support of 27 million 
developers worldwide.
Java
As of July 31, 2021, there are 430,995 unique 
projects (group\-artifacts) available in the Maven 
Central Repository, up 13% from last year. This 
public catalog of Java components now offers 
developers a total of 7\.3 million different versions 
(group\-artifact\-versions) of projects to choose 
from, up 19% from last year.
In the past year alone, project owners released 
more than 1\.1 million new versions of existing 
components, and introduced 136,000 brand new 
projects to service and support approximately 
eight million Java developers.

JavaScript
As of July 31, 2021 there were 1,864,696 JavaScript 
packages available in the npm repository, up 16% 
from last year. This public catalog of JavaScript 
packages offers developers a total of 21,320,796 
different versions. In the past year alone, npm 
project owners released 3,797,675 new versions 
of packages, and introduced 405,243 brand new 
projects to service and support approximately 12 
million JavaScript developers.
Python
336,402 packages are available in the Python 
Package Index (PyPI), up 18% from last year. This 
public catalog of Python packages offers develop\-
ers a total of 3,035,265 different versions. In the 
past year alone, python project owners released 
556,327 new versions of packages, and introduced 
93,032 brand new projects to service and support 
approximately eight million Python developers.
.NET
338,423 open source projects are available in the 
NuGet gallery, up 14% from last year. This public 
catalog of .net packages offers developers a total 
of 5,698,716 different versions. In the past year 
alone, the NuGet gallery released 756,444 new 
versions of packages, and introduced 87,268 brand 
new projects.

Open Source Demand
In 2021, developers around the world will borrow 
more than 2\.2 trillion open source packages 
or components from third\-party ecosystems 
for two simple reasons: it makes life easier for 
software developers and it accelerates the pace 
of innovation.
Java
Through the first seven months of 2021, 267 billion 
Java components were downloaded from the 
Maven Central Repository. At this rate, the volume 
3  pypistats.org
for 2021 is projected to be over 457 billion, 
a 71% YoY increase.
JavaScript
In 2020, JavaScript developers requested more 
than one trillion packages from npmjs. The 
volume for 2021 is expected to reach 1\.5 trillion, 
a 50% YoY increase.
Python
In 2020, Python developers downloaded 66 billion3 
packages from PyPi. For the full year of 2021, PyPi 
download volume is expected to be 127 billion 
packages. YoY growth of PyPi download volume is 
estimated to be 92% 
.NET
.NET developers were also eager to consume 
OSS packages over the past year. Developers 
downloaded 44 billion NuGet packages in 2020\. 
In 2021 developers will download more than 78 
billion packages, representing a 78% YoY growth.

FIGURE 1\.5
VULNERABLE RELEASE DENSITY VS. POPULARITY
Open Source Security
The amount of third\-party code flowing through 
software supply chains is massive. But is it secure? 
Are certain open source ecosystems more or less 
risky? Are certain projects safer than others? Are 
popular projects more or less likely to have known 
vulnerabilities? Here’s what the data reveals.
When examining the top 10% of the most popular 
Java, JavaScript, Python, and .NET projects, 29% of 
them contain at least one known security vulnera\-
bility. Conversely, when examining the remaining 
90% of less popular projects, only 6\.5% of them 
contain known vulnerabilities. These findings 
indicate that the vast majority of security research 
(blackhat and whitehat) is focused on finding and 
reporting vulnerabilities in projects that are most 
commonly utilized. 
In addition to studying the difference in vulnera\-
bility density between popular and non popular 
open source projects, we also present below the

C H A P T E R 1 : O P E N S O U R C E S U P P LY, D E M A N D, A N D S E C U R I T Y
aggregate vulnerability density for each of the 
four ecosystems.
Java (Maven)
As of July 31, 2021, 612,988 (8\.4%) of all compo\-
nent versions housed in Maven Central contain at 
least one known security vulnerability. To exclude 
low level security issues, we determined severity 
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring 
System (CVSS), for medium (5\), high (7\), and critical 
(9\), Of the issues identified:
 
⊲356,808 (4\.9%) had a CVSS of 9 or higher
 
⊲488,826 (6\.7%) had a CVSS of 7 or higher
 
⊲598,364 (8\.2%) had a CVSS of 5 or higher
For the past eight years, Sonatype has also 
analyzed the patterns and practices associated 
with Java components being downloaded from 
Maven Central. In 2020 and through the first seven 
months of 2021, 8% of the downloads had at least 
one known vulnerability. 
JavaScript (npm)
As of July 31, 2021, 459,576 (2\.2%) project versions 
housed in npm contain at least one known security 
vulnerability. Of the issues identified:
 
⊲250,002 (1\.2%) had a CVSS of 9 or higher
 
⊲350,737 (1\.6%) had a CVSS of 7 or higher
 
⊲450,734 (2\.1%) had a CVSS of 5 or higher
Notably, however, of the nearly 1\.9 million 
JavaScript top level projects available, only 2% of 
those are being used with any regularity.
Python (pypi)
As of July 31, 2021, 147,994 (0\.5%) package versions 
housed in the PyPI repository contained at least one 
known security vulnerability. Of the issues identified:
 
⊲81,731 (.4%) had a CVSS of 9 or higher
 
⊲111,970 (.4%) had a CVSS of 7 or higher
 
⊲143,902 (.5%) had a CVSS of 5 or higher
.NET (Nuget)
As of July 31, 2021, 112,031 (2%) of package 
versions housed in the NuGet Gallery contained 
at least one known security vulnerability. Of the 
issues identified:
 
⊲27,288 (.5%) had a CVSS of 9 or higher
 
⊲99,096 (1\.7%) had a CVSS of 7 or higher
 
⊲110,764 (1\.9%) had a CVSS of 5 or higher
Software Supply Chain 
Attacks Increase 650%
Members of the world’s open source community 
are facing a novel and rapidly expanding threat 
that has nothing to do with passive adversaries 
exploiting known vulnerabilities in the wild — and 
everything to do with aggressive attackers implant\-
ing malware directly into open source projects to 
infiltrate the commercial supply chain.
Legacy software supply chain “exploits," such as 
the now infamous 2017 Struts incident at Equifax, 
prey on publicly disclosed open source vulnera\-
bilities that are left unpatched in the wild. Next\-
generation software supply chain “attacks” are far 
more sinister, however, because bad actors are no 
longer waiting for public vulnerability disclosures 
to pursue an exploit. Instead, they are taking the 
initiative and injecting new vulnerabilities into 
open source projects that feed the global supply 
chain, and then exploiting those vulnerabilities

before they are discovered. By shifting their attacks 
“upstream," bad actors can gain leverage and the 
crucial benefit of time that that enables malware to 
propagate throughout the supply chain, enabling 
far more scalable attacks on “downstream” users.
According to security researchers at the University 
of Bonn, SAP Labs France, and Fraunhofer FKIE, 
“From an attacker’s point of view, \[large scale, 
public internet\-based] package repositories 
represent a reliable and scalable malware distribu\-
tion channel. Thus far, Node.js (npm) and Python 
(PyPI) repositories have been the primary targets 
of malicious packages, supposedly due to the fact 
that malicious code can be easily triggered during 
package installation."4
From February 2015 to June 2019, 216 software 
supply chain attacks were recorded. Then, 
from July 2019 to May 2020, the number of 
attacks increased to 929 attacks. However, 
in the past year, such attacks represented a 
650% YoY increase (see Figure 1\.6 above).
Dependency Confusion
The most common type of attack in 2021 has been 
Dependency Confusion (aka namespace confusion).
The novel, highly targeted, attack vector allows 
unwanted or malicious code to be introduced 
downstream automatically, without relying on 
typosquatting or brandjacking techniques. The 
technique involves a bad actor determining the 
names of proprietary (inner source) packages 
utilized by a company’s production application. 
4  arxiv.org/pdf/2005\.09535\.pdf
5  12,000 statistic counts PyPI and npm 5k package flood as a single attack; not multiple attacks.
Equipped with this information, the bad actor then 
publishes a malicious package using the exact 
same name, and a newer semantic version, to a 
public repository, like npmjs, that does not regulate 
namespace identity. At this point, certain pipeline 
build tools will automatically fetch the newer, 
intentionally malicious version. In the past year, 
namespace confusion has alone accounted for 
instances of attempted or confirmed supply chain 
attacks.5 This attack vector relies on the long estab\-
lished convention in some programming languages 
to fetch the “LATEST” version of any package.
Typosquatting
Typosquatting was the second most common tech\-
nique over the past year. This indirect attack vector 
preys on developers making otherwise innocent 
typos when searching for popular components. For 
example, if a developer accidentally types “electorn” 
when their intention is to source “electron," they 
might accidentally install a malicious component of a 
similar name (see electorn, September 2020\).
Malicious Source Code Injections
Malicious Source Code Injections are another type 
of attack that have been less prevalent in the past 
year compared to previous years. Such attacks 
involve injecting malicious source code directly into 
an open source project’s repository, and have been 
conducted in various ways, including:
 
⊲stealing credentials from a project maintainer (see 
rest\-client, 8/19\)
 
⊲releasing new versions of a project to a public 
repository (see bootstrap\-sass, 4/19\)
 
⊲contributing pull requests to a project that 
includes malicious code (see event\-stream, 11/18\)
 
⊲tampering with open source developer tools that 
inject malicious code into downstream applica\-
tions (see Octopus Scanner, 5/20\). 
With code injections, it is likely that no one knows 
the malware is there, except for the person that 
planted it. This approach allows adversaries to 
surreptitiously “set traps” upstream, and then carry 
out attacks downstream once the vulnerability has 
moved through the supply chain and into the code 
bases of thousands of companies. 
Front Page News
In the past year, numerous high\-profile and 
prominent attacks demonstrated how supply chain 
threats affect not only third\-party application level 
libraries and tools, but also first\-party source code. 
The European Union’s Cybersecurity Agency 
(ENISA) predicts these types of supply chain attacks 
are expected to increase 4x in 2021\. 
SolarWinds — December 2020
The massive SolarWinds Orion attack publicized in 
December 2020 marked the most notable supply 
chain attack of the past year. The attack started 
with threat actors gaining access to SolarWinds’ 
internal development tools to inject malicious 
code into SolarWinds’ Orion update binaries. 
These trojanized updates delivered a backdoor 
known as SUNBURST and Solorigate, to systems 
running Orion platform versions. The impact?

Roughly, 18,000 customers automatically pulled 
these malicious updates, exposing the networks 
of large companies and government entities like 
the National Nuclear Security Administration and 
enabling the bad actors to explore and exploit their 
networks at will over the course of many months.
By attacking the SolarWinds software supply chain 
and mingling their malicious code with the legitimate, 
trusted code that was delivered to their clients, 
attackers were able to plant backdoors on the sys\-
tems of tens of thousands of SolarWinds’ customers.
Namespace Confusion — February 2021
In February 2021, news broke of a researcher, 
Alex Birsan, hacking over 35 big tech firms in a 
novel supply chain attack dubbed “dependency 
confusion.” The name of this attack refers to the 
inability of your development environment to 
distinguish between a private, internally\-created 
dependency in your software build, and a package 
by the same name available in a public software 
repository.
In other words, should an attacker register the 
name of your private, internally\-used dependency 
on a public repository, such as npmjs, your software 
development tool may inadvertently pull in the 
attacker’s malicious dependency as opposed to 
your legitimate one.
Within 72 hours after news of the namespace attack 
vector became public, automated malware detec\-
tion services observed 300\+ copycats emerging 
from other researchers interested in earning a bug 
bounty. One week later, the number of copycat 
attacks increased to 575\. The following week, it 
was 750\. By March 15, 2021, Sonatype’s automated 
malware detection service had observed more than 
10,000 dependency confusion copycats having 
infiltrated npm and other ecosystems.
Not all copycats were benign proof of concepts. 
In search of bug bounty payouts, thousands were 
published by bad actors with malicious intent. 
Some of the copycats were even aimed as “vigi\-
lante vandalism” on the open source repositories. 
“The fact that so much of the npm ecosystem is 
not namespaced has actually created potential 
build time malware injection possibilities. If I know

the name of a package in use by a company, I 
could go publish a malicious package using the 
exact same name with a new version number 
and know that it’s very likely that it would be 
ingested over the intended, internally developed 
package," said Sonatype CTO Brian Fox in 2017\.
Public repositories that do not strictly enforce 
namespace rules, including npm, PyPI, RubyGems, 
and NuGet, are susceptible to namespace confu\-
sion. In contrast, the Maven Central and Golang’s 
pkg.go.dev repositories enforce strict namespacing 
and verify namespace ownership before artifacts 
can be published.
Codecov — April 2021
The Codecov supply chain attack publicized in April 
2021 was similar to the SolarWinds attack. In this 
case, bad actors compromised a Codecov server 
to inject their malicious code into a Bash Uploader 
script that was then downloaded by Codecov’s 
customers over the course of two months.
Using the Bash uploader script used by Codecov 
customers, the attackers exfiltrated sensitive 
information including keys, tokens, and credentials 
from those customers' Continuous Integration/
Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) environments. Using 
these harvested credentials, Codecov attackers 
reportedly breached hundreds of customer 
networks, including HashiCorp, Twilio, Rapid7, 
Monday.com, and e\-commerce giant Mercari.
Although much focus has been on the compro\-
mised Bash Uploader script, the credentials used 
to modify the script were originally obtained by 
the attackers from a flawed Docker image creation 
process, according to Codecov. In aggregate, the 
incident highlighted the importance of securing 
CI/CD pipelines, including scrutinizing the secrets 
filed in these environments, and stepping up 
container security.
Microsoft’s Winget — May 2021
In May 2021, Microsoft released the first stable ver\-
sion of its Windows 10 package manager, Winget, 
which enabled users to manage apps via the 
command\-line. Users were able to propose or add 
new packages to Winget on the project’s GitHub 
repository. But, over the weekend after its launch, 
many flooded Winget's software registry with pull 
requests for apps that were either duplicates or 
malformed. Moreover, some newly added duplicate 
packages were corrupted (incomplete) and ended 
up overwriting the existing packages. Over 60 such 
instances were seen. The incident raised serious 
concerns among developers about the integrity of 
the Winget ecosystem.
Kaseya — July 2021
In July 2021, the world witnessed another form 
of upstream software supply\-chain attack. In this 
case, the REvil ransomware group aka Sodinokibi 
discovered and exploited a zero\-day vulnerability 
in Kaseya’s Virtual System Administrator (VSA). The 
VSA tool is a remote monitoring and management 
software platform used by dozens of managed 
security service providers who in turn service 
thousands of downstream customers.
It didn’t take long for the threat actors to follow 
up with a $70 million ransom demand to decrypt 
files for more than 1,500 victims. “This episode 
represents yet another incident in a long trend 
observed over many years: in order to scale 
exploitation of downstream victims, bad actors 
are increasingly targeting technology assets and 
providers that live upstream within the digital value 
stream. This includes open source libraries, IDEs, 
build servers, update servers, and, most recently 
in the case of Kaseya, Managed Service Providers 
(MSPs),” Sonatype’s Matt Howard said in a blog 
post following the incident.
Although there are many tools designed to protect 
the perimeter of downstream technology assets, 
the truth of the matter is this: software itself is 
increasingly the soft underbelly of digital risk. If the 
past year is any indication, we expect that attackers 
will continue to target upstream software supply 
chain assets as a preferred path to exploiting 
downstream victims at scale.
This Kaseya incident quickly got the attention of 
US law enforcement authorities, including the FBI 
and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
Agency (CISA). It is a reminder for our industry and 
cyber defense teams to shift security left and focus 
on securing the upstream portion of the digital 
supply chain with the same energy and vigor that 
has long focused on the downstream portion.

CHAPTER 2
Understanding Exemplary 
and Non\-Exemplary 
Open Source Projects
Given its prominence in modern software devel\-
opment, the quality of open source libraries used 
from third\-party suppliers has a fundamental impact 
on digital innovation. But how should engineering 
leaders go about choosing the best open source 
projects? Which ones are optimal? Which ones are 
suboptimal? Further, how should engineering teams 
think about project hygiene, not only as it pertains 
to direct dependencies, but also transitive? 
In this chapter we describe open source project 
quality metrics collected from the Maven Central 
ecosystem and compare them with recent quality 
metrics proposed by the Open Source Security 
Foundation (OpenSSF) and Libraries.io.
Our analysis reveals that MTTU, a measure of a 
project’s dependency update velocity, is strongly 
associated with improved project security. We 
did not find OpenSSF Criticality or Libraries.
io Sourcerank to be associated with improved 
project security.
Thus, in order to minimize risk associated with 
vulnerabilities in third\-party open source libraries, 
we recommend that software development teams 
adopt defined criteria for selecting open source 
projects. Further, we recommend that teams 
select projects that have low MTTU.
Open Source Project Quality Metrics
Sonatype Mean Time to Update (MTTU)
MTTU is the average time required for a project 
to respond to new versions of its dependencies. 
Figure 2\.1 shows how MTTU is calculated. Suppose 
we have a component A with dependencies B 
and C, both at version 1\.2\. Suppose B and C each 
release a new version (1\.3\) and some time later 
A releases a new version that bumps the version 
of B and C to 1\.3\. The time between the release 
of B version 1\.3 and the release of A version 1\.3 
is the Time To Upgrade (TTU) for A’s migration to 
B version 1\.3 (and similarly for A’s adoption of C 
version 1\.3\). The average of all these upgrade times 
is then the MTTU. 
MTTU provides visibility into an open source proj\-
ects’ dependency management practices — Lower 
is better. Projects that consistently react quickly to 
dependency upgrades in their downstream depen\-
dency chain will have low MTTU. Projects that either 
consistently react slowly or have high variance in 
their reaction time will have higher MTTU.
Figure 2\.2 shows which percentage of components 
achieve various MTTU performance based on 
update data from 2020\. Note that while the percent\-
ages climb quickly (26% upgrade within 20 days, 
44% within 40, and 57% within 60\), there is a long 
tail of slow\-to\-upgrade components, with 9% of 
components taking more than 180 days to upgrade.
FIGURE 2\.1
CALCULATING MTTU
FIGURE 2\.2
MTTU PERFORMANCE, 2020
16
2021 STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN REPORT
CHAPTER 2: UNDERSTANDING EXEMPLARY AND NON\-EXEMPLARY OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS 
This slow update behavior has an even stronger 
impact as dependency chains grow. If a transitive 
dependency N levels deep releases an important 
security update, and each component on the 
dependency path takes D days to upgrade, then 
the top level application doesn’t benefit from this 
fix for N × D days. Thus, even a chain of exemplary 
components that each upgrade within 20 days 
would result in a lag time of 100 days for a depen\-
dency five levels deep.
MTTU provides a measure of project quality that 
is based on how quickly the project moves to 
update dependencies. By this measure, quality 
has been increasing over the years.In Figure 2\.3, 
we provide a graph of the distribution of project 
MTTU values by year for every year since 2011\. 
We can see that in addition to the number of 
 projects growing over the years, there has been a 
clear trend toward faster MTTUs as shown below.

⊲2021 average MTTU (as of Aug 1\) \= 28 days6
MTTU AND SECURITY
While MTTU does not directly measure respon\-
siveness to security issues, our analysis in previous 
years has found that MTTU is correlated with 
mean time to remediate (MTTR), which is the time 
required to update dependencies that have pub\-
lished vulnerabilities, as shown in Figure 2\.4\. MTTR 
is defined just like MTTU, except that we take the 
average of those dependencies that were known to 
be vulnerable at the time of the update.
In our previous research7, we found a significant 
correlation between MTTR and MTTU (Pearson 
correlation was 0\.6 with N \= 17,017\). MTTR is gener\-
ally only available for more popular and thus more 
scrutinized projects. Many projects fall below the 
level of usage required for security researchers to

perform vulnerability research and discover latent 
issues in the codebase. MTTU on the other hand 
is available for all projects, providing a common 
source of data for evaluating project quality. Thus, 
we consider MTTU to be the best metric available 
to determine the impact a component will have 
on the security of projects that incorporate it. 
Later in this chapter, we perform additional novel 
research to further confirm the value of MTTU.
Libraries.io Sourcerank
This metric aims to measure the quality of software, 
mostly focusing on project documentation, maturity, 
and community. It is computed by evaluating a 
number of yes / no responses to questions such 
as “Is the project more than six months old?” and 
a set of numerical questions, such as “How many 
‘stars’ does the project have?” These are distilled 
into a single score, with yes / no questions adding 
or subtracting a fixed number of “points." Numerical 
values are then converted into points using a for\-
mula, e.g. “log(num\_stars)/2\." The current maximum 
number of points is approximately 30\.
OpenSSF Criticality Score
OpenSSF has a set of analyses that combine into 
a metric called “criticality." Criticality measures a 
project's community, usage, and activity. This is dis\-
tilled into a score that is intended to measure how 
crucial the project is in the open source ecosystem.
OpenSSF Scorecard
OpenSSF also has a more extensive evaluation of 
project quality called the “Scorecard” project. This 
project provides support for automatically monitoring 
development practices, tooling use, and other project 
quality and maturity attributes, then reporting which 
checks succeed and which fail. OpenSSF does not 
provide a mechanism for distilling this “Scorecard” 
into a single metric and so we did not include it in the 
quantitative analysis we describe below.
Quality Metric Comparison
Figure 2\.5 summarizes the four proposed project 
quality frameworks by showing to what extent they 
incorporate information about five dimensions of 
quality: maturity, popularity, activity, dependency 
management, and development practices.
Popularity
Libraries.IO includes project popularity metrics 
(stars, subscribers, and usage) as part of their 
Sourcerank metric. OpenSSF’s criticality metric 
includes usage (the number of projects that use 
the library) but not stars or subscribers. OpenSSF’s 
Scorecard system and MTTU do not include any 
factors that are related to popularity.
Activity
All four quality frameworks include some aspect of 
activity analysis. Sonatype’s MTTU metric is lightly 
correlated with activity because fast MTTU requires 
frequent releases. Libraries.IO Sourcerank tracks 
whether a project has been updated in the last 
six months, another weak correlation with activity. 
OpenSSF’s Scorecard metric includes a check 
(whether there has been a commit in the last 90 
days) that is also weakly correlated with activity. 
The OpenSSF Criticality metric includes a robust 
set of activity measures such as commit frequency 
and release count.
Dependencies
Sonatype’s MTTU provides the most robust measure 
of dependency update practices, as it measures how 
quickly a project updates its dependencies once 
new versions are released. Libraries.IO Sourcerank 
checks whether there were outdated dependencies 
at the time of scoring. OpenSSF Scorecard checks 
if automated dependency update tools are used. 
OpenSSF Criticality does not consider dependency 
management practices.
Dev Practices
The OpenSSF Scorecard is the only measure that 
considers development practices such as whether 
a code review is performed, and whether contin\-
uous integration and Static Analysis and Security 
Testing (SAST) tooling is used.
Maturity
Libraries.IO and OpenSSF metrics include measures 
of maturity. Libraries.IO Sourcerank includes 
semantic versioning checks and a number of doc\-
umentation checks. OpenSSF Scorecard includes

similar versioning and documentation checks, as well 
as checks regarding how the project is packaged 
and distributed. The OpenSSF Criticality metric 
includes checks that consider how quickly issues are 
resolved, responsiveness of contributors, and when 
the project was originally created.
As Figure 2\.5 shows, no single metric provides 
robust coverage across all five attributes. However, 
by combining metrics, we can determine which 
projects score highly across popularity, activity, 
dependencies, dev practices, and maturity metrics. 
In the following section, we evaluate the individual 
metrics, as well as these combined metrics to 
determine which signals are most important in 
identifying high\-quality projects that enable faster 
innovation with less risk.
Research Findings
When using open source components, there are a 
number of outcomes that developers would rather 
avoid. Components can contain vulnerabilities, 
which their applications then inherit. Worse, 
components can be vulnerable without having an 
available remediation path (e.g. “no path forward,” 
described later in this chapter), requiring significant 
effort to refactor or deprecate the component. 
Component upgrades can also break application 
builds, requiring even more development work. 
To determine which components exhibit higher and 
lower quality traits, we analyzed 100,000 applica\-
tions. We looked at the individual quality metrics 
to identify which measures are most useful when 
choosing components.
All told, we obtained a collection of 39,164 open 
source components that were used across these 
100,000 applications. We were able to obtain MTTU 
data for 52% of components, Sourcerank scores for 
91% of components, and Criticality scores for 40% 
of these components.
The data set contained 233,569 component 
versions. For each version, we evaluated whether it 
was subject to any of the following conditions:
 
⊲Vulnerable: A component is vulnerable if it or 
any of its transitive dependencies contain a 
known security issue. Overall, 5,175 vulnerable 
component versions were found.
 
⊲No Path Forward: A component has no path 
forward (NPF) if the latest version of that 
component is vulnerable. This means the 
vulnerability cannot be remediated by upgrading 
the component. For direct dependencies, 
this occurs if a project is slow to remediate 
security issues in its codebase. For transitive 
dependencies, this occurs when a project is 
slow to update its own vulnerable dependencies 
(or these dependencies are slow to fix issues 
and update their dependencies, etc.). Overall, 
788 component versions had no path forward 
at the time they were found to be vulnerable.
 
⊲Breaking Changes: A component has breaking 
changes if an update to that component changes 
public APIs in a manner that would cause either 
builds to break or runtime errors. Overall, 1,116 
component versions had breaking changes, 
affecting 349 projects.
Exemplars
We consider exemplary projects to be those that 
are in the top 25% according to the metrics of 
interest. We then check to see whether exemplary 
projects are less likely to have the undesirable 
outcomes described above when compared to 
the bottom 25% of the population. In other words: 
if you select a top\-rated project as compared to a 
bottom\-rated project, what difference in outcomes 
would you expect? We also include a comparison 
with a selection method based purely on popularity, 
as measured by the number of times a component 
occurs in application scans.
Figure 2\.6 summarizes, for each type of exemplar, 
and each outcome type, whether we found a 
statistically significant difference in the likelihood 
of negative outcomes, and the factor difference 
observed. Bolded entries are statistically significant 
at a level of p \< 0\.005, while non\-bolded entries 
have p \< 0\.05\. That is: our confidence that we’re 
seeing a true effect is higher for the bolded entries. 
19
2021 STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN REPORT
CHAPTER 2: UNDERSTANDING EXEMPLARY AND NON\-EXEMPLARY OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS 
We color entries red when the effect is in the 
negative direction, for example if a high\-quality 
component is more likely to contain a vulnerability.
In summary, Sonatype MTTU is the best metric 
for identifying open source projects that are less 
likely to contain vulnerabilities. Popularity and 
Sourcerank (which includes popularity measures) 
are poor metrics to consider if the goal is strictly to 
avoid vulnerable versions, as more popular projects 
tend to have more reported vulnerabilities, as 
discussed in Chapter 1\.
SECURITY
As in previous studies, we see a strong correlation 
between better update hygiene, as measured by 
MTTU, and security, as measured by lower rates of 
“vulnerabilities” and “No Path Forward” conditions. 
Components with faster MTTU were 1\.8 times less 
likely to have vulnerabilities when compared to the 
bottom 25% and much less likely to be stuck in a 
vulnerable state due to having no path forward.
MTTU AND TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCIES
Upgrade responsiveness is particularly important 
when it comes to resolving security issues with 
transitive dependencies. When incorporating 
open source components into an application, that 
program inherits not only the direct code quality 
and security practices of the component, but also 
its approach to dependency management. 
New versions of dependencies typically bring 
bug fixes, security patches, new functionality, and 
performance improvements. Ideally, each library in 
the dependency tree for a component would swiftly 
upgrade their direct dependencies, thus ensuring 
that these new versions make their way swiftly 
throughout the dependency tree. MTTU measures 
exactly the extent to which this happens.
POPULARITY
In previous reports, we showed that Maven Central 
download popularity was a poor predictor of 
dependency management quality. This year, we 
examined popularity as measured by the number 
of times a component occurs in application scans. 
We again found the same results: popularity is not 
a good predictor of security. In fact, in this year’s 
result, popularity was misleading, with more pop\-
ular projects more likely to contain vulnerabilities 
and be stuck in no path forward states. Libraries.IO 
Sourcerank had a similar association with vulnera\-
bility, which is not surprising as Sourcerank includes 
multiple attributes focused on project popularity.
Guidance for Open Source Project 
Owners and Contributors
While there are plenty of projects that obtain good 
outcomes without following all the practices con\-
sidered by the project quality metrics we discussed 
here, there is strong evidence that these practices 
lead directly to improved security and quality 
outcomes. We therefore recommend that project 
maintainers strive to adopt the best practices 
measured by Sonatype’s MTTU and OpenSSF’s 
Criticality metrics. 
While the factors in the OpenSSF Scorecard may 
also improve project quality, we were not able to 
empirically evaluate this possibility because the 
OpenSSF Scorecard does not provide an associ\-
ated quantitative metric.
Guidance for Enterprise 
Development Teams
Choosing high\-quality open source projects is an 
important strategic decision for enterprise soft\-
ware development organizations. Components 
exhibit a wide variety of outcomes in terms of 
release velocity, security remediation behavior, 
and likelihood of breaking changes. Chapter 3 
of this paper details the impact this can have on 
development efficiency of projects using these 
components. Therefore, we recommend choosing 
components with low MTTU values and high 
Criticality scores. 
While Libraries.IO Sourcerank wasn’t associated 
with higher performance in the outcomes we 
considered, it may well promote other desirable 
effects and does contain sensible practices. There 
is little reason not to prefer applications with higher 
Libraries.IO Sourcerank if they have high Criticality 
scores and low MTTU.
Just as traditional manufacturing supply chains 
intentionally select parts from approved suppliers 
and rely upon formalized procurement practices 
— enterprise development teams should adopt 
similar criteria for their selection of open source 
components. This practice ensures the highest 
quality parts are selected from the best and fewest 
suppliers — a practice W. Edwards Deming recom\-
mended for decades to manufacturers of physical 
goods. Implementing selection criteria and update 
practices will not only improve code quality, but 
can accelerate mean time to repair when suppliers 
discover new defects or vulnerabilities.

CHAPTER 3
Peer Practices Associated 
With Micro and Macro 
Dependency Management
In today’s world, a wide variety of bits are flowing 
rapidly through our software supply chains. 
Because of this, an equally wide variety of decisions 
must be made by engineering team members 
across every phase of the DevSecOps value 
stream. What you will see in the following research 
is that software developers make suboptimal 
choices 69% of the time with respect to updating 
third\-party dependencies.
In particular, there are two types of decisions that 
have become increasingly critical to maintaining 
healthy software supply chains:
1\. Micro dependency decisions: frequent tactical 
decisions that developers must make on a daily 
basis to determine whether or not to update 
existing dependencies when newer versions 
become available.
2\. Macro architectural decisions: strategic decisions 
that software architects and engineering leaders 
must make when deciding which open source 
projects are optimal for their products and why.
8  2019 State of the Software Supply Chain
But how should these decisions be made at scale?
 
⊲Should companies expect software developers to 
intuitively know the right action to take?
 
⊲What are the benefits of making good decisions?
 
⊲What are the costs of making bad decisions?
 
⊲Do engineering leaders have a responsibility to 
equip developers with information designed to 
automate better decision making?
These are a few of the questions that we attempt to 
answer in Chapter 3\.
To Update or Not: An Empirical View 
of Micro Dependency Management
There are three reasons why dependency manage\-
ment is rapidly becoming an increasingly important 
practice for software engineering teams:
1\. The enormous volume of open source depen\-
dencies present in production applications.
2\. The incredible velocity at which new versions of 
dependencies are being released.
3\. The fact that open source dependencies age like 
milk, and not like wine.
The average modern application contains 128 open 
source dependencies, and the average open source 
project releases 10 times per year8\. This reality, com\-
bined with the fact that a few hyper\-active projects 
release more than 8,000 times per year, creates a 
situation in which developers must constantly decide

CHAPTER 3: PEER PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH MICRO AND MACRO DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT
when (and when not to) update third\-party 
dependencies inside of their applications. 
But, ask most developers about dependency 
management, and they’ll tell you the same 
thing: keeping open source libraries fresh and 
optimally up to date is a good idea that requires 
terribly mundane work. In other words, in the 
eyes of most software engineers, dependency 
management is seen as a thankless maintenance 
task that’s easy to get wrong, hard to get right, 
and generally detracts from time spent innovating. 
Developers know that it’s important, but they 
frequently don’t have the time or patience to 
make it a priority and lack the tooling to do it 
optimally. It’s no wonder that many developers 
describe this situation as “dependency hell.”
The result is that dependencies in applications can 
easily grow old and stale (vulnerable) despite the 
possibility that newer and fresher (more secure) 
versions are readily available.
In light of these circumstances, Sonatype 
researchers set out to answer the question: 
are developers making efficient dependency 
management decisions?
9  100,000 anonymized, validated applications scanned by publicly available and commercial vulnerability analysis tools.
To understand the relative quality of current depen\-
dency management decisions, Sonatype research\-
ers spent the past year studying 100,000 Java 
applications9 and analyzing more than four million 
component migrations (upgrades from version n to 
any number of potential newer versions).
In support of our research, we developed a scoring 
algorithm (Figure 3\.3\) designed to measure the 
relative quality of component migration decisions. 
The “component choice” algorithm is derived 
from eight common\-sense rules distilled from the 
insights in the previous chapter.
Research results:
1\. 10% of the projects in the Maven Central ecosys\-
tem are being used in production apps — and 
only 25% of those are actively being updated, 
which itself is a massive and complex effort.
2\. Upgrade decisions are highly variable and fre\-
quently suboptimal, yet herd behavior doesn’t lie.
3\. Newer versions are generally better, but not 
always best.

8 RULES FOR UPGRADING TO THE OPTIMAL VERSION

CHAPTER 3: PEER PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH MICRO AND MACRO DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT
FINDING \#1: 
Dependency management is a 
massive effort practiced on only 
25% of libraries in production apps.
With 430,000 projects to choose from in Maven 
Central, it’s remarkable that 100,000 Enterprise 
Java applications are leveraging only 40,000 (10%) 
of available projects. Furthermore, of the 40,000 
projects being leveraged, only 10,000 (25%) are 
actively being managed and updated by the down\-
stream software developers using these projects 
(Figure 3\.4\). Notwithstanding, it is staggering to see 
these 10,000 projects were updated more than 
4 million times across 105,170 versions, with an 
estimated effort of one hour per update. 
Needless to say, when it comes to dependency man\-
agement, the level of developer effort and scale of 
developer decision making is massive, even though 
it only pertains to 25% of utilized dependencies.
Our analysis of 100,000 applications revealed that 
75% of components in use were not upgraded in 
the last year. Why is that? Is it because engineers 
are indifferent? Is it because they are afraid of 
breaking builds? Or, is it simply because developers 
lack structured guidance at their fingertips?
Regardless of the reason, a majority of depen\-
dencies are simply not being updated in a regular 
manner. This is a missed opportunity for engineer\-
ing teams to improve quality, minimize risk, reduce 
unplanned work, and save money by proactively 
managing 100% of their dependencies. 
FINDING \#2: 
Upgrades are variable 
and suboptimal, and herd 
behavior doesn't lie.
Upgrades are variable and suboptimal.
Our research revealed that organizations perform 
an average of 6,200 component migrations per 
year, and that 69% of the target migration choices 
made were suboptimal because they failed to 
identify the best version to upgrade to. 
Migration decisions were divided into five groups, 
as outlined in Figure 3\.5\. 
Whenever a developer updates a dependency, 
they have on average 21 available versions to 
choose from. Without intelligent automation to

CHAPTER 3: PEER PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH MICRO AND MACRO DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT
support them, and with so many versions to choose 
from, it is inevitable that developers will guess 
incorrectly which version is best.
Understanding “imperfect choices”.
To understand the definition of an imperfect 
upgrade choice, consider the following scenario:
Component foo was upgraded four times over the 
course of a year. At the time of each upgrade, the 
developer should reasonably consider all available 
versions and take into account multiple dimensions 
of data including: security, quality, popularity, and 
licensing, as set out in Chapter 2\.
In Figure 3\.6, upgrades 1 and 2 occurred when the 
optimal version was 1\.9 according to the “compo\-
nent choice” rules, as described on page 23\.
Upgrades 3 and 4 occurred after a new component 
version became available which made 1\.11 the new 
optimal version.
In the aggregate, upgrades 1 and 3 were subopti\-
mal, resulting in unnecessary upgrades 2 and 4\.
The cost of performing suboptimal upgrades to a 
single component, for a single team, for a single 
application is small. However, when considering the 
fact that only 31% of upgrade decisions examined in 
this study were optimal, it is easy to see how much 
time and effort developers could save by consis\-
tently making better upgrade decisions. Specifically, 
in our sampling of 100,000 applications and four 
million update decisions, we discovered that 69% of 
such decisions were suboptimal. 
Equipped with intelligent automation, a medium 
sized enterprise with 20 application development 
teams would save a total of 160 developer days 
(1,280 hours) and $192,000 per year at a fully 
loaded cost of $150 per hour. This would give each 
development team almost two weeks of extra 
productivity time — each year.

Herd behavior doesn’t lie.
By examining 100,000 applications and four million 
migration decisions made by the developer herd, it 
is easy to visualize patterns and practices associ\-
ated with both efficient and inefficient dependency 
management behaviors.
On the previous page, Figure 3\.8 provides a visual 
summary of herd migration behavior over the past 
year associated with spring\-core, a single compo\-
nent within the highly popular spring\-framework.

activity, with the top row representing herd migra\-
tion decisions made one year ago, and the bottom

during the most recent week. The x\-axis represents 
the 150 most recent versions with older versions to 
the left, and newer versions to the right.
FINDING \#3: 
New versions are not 
necessarily better.
In an attempt to help automate dependency 
management decision making, some package 
managers provide for an open\-ended version 
range that pulls the latest version as soon as it 
becomes available. In the spirit of keeping things 
fresh, many tools myopically submit pull requests 
for every new release. While such updates happen 
automatically, they can also have unintended 
consequences like the introduction of unplanned 
work and unnecessary security risk – e.g. malware 
injection and namespace confusion (Dependabot, 
Renabot, etc.). This type of naive dependency 
update strategy can lead to frustration and distrac\-
tion for project maintainers, as described by Dan 
Abranov’s recent blog.
To contextually automate dependency manage\-
ment, more intelligent tools are emerging that 
minimize both upgrade risk and upgrade events, 
thereby maximizing overall efficiency. Using the 
upgrade rules defined in Figure 3\.3, we find there 
is a correlation between optimal choice and the 
latest version. Score 9 is assigned to the optimal

choice. On average, the most optimal target is 2\.7 
versions from the LATEST version, demonstrating 
that the most recent release is not the best 
choice, and highlighting why simplistic update 
policies are insufficient.
FINDING \#4: 
Three distinct patterns of 
dependency management behavior.
Our analysis reveals that development teams 
exhibit three distinct patterns of dependency 
management behavior:
Teams Living in Disarray
 Developers working on these teams lack auto\-
mated guidance. They update dependencies 
infrequently. When they do update, they utilize gut 
instincts and commonly make suboptimal deci\-
sions. This approach to dependency management 
is highly reactive, wasteful, not scalable, and leads 
to stale software with elevated technical debt and 
increased security risk.
Teams Living on the Edge
Developers working on these teams benefit 
from simplistic but non\-contextual automation. 
Dependencies are automatically updated to the lat\-
est version, whether optimal or not. Such automation 
helps to keep software fresh, but it can inadvertently 
lead to increased security risks and higher costs 
associated with unnecessary updates and broken 
builds. This approach is proactive and scalable, but 
not optimal in terms of expense or outcomes. 
Teams Living Close to the Edge
Developers working on these teams have the 
advantage of intelligent and contextual automa\-
tion. Dependencies are automatically recom\-
mended for updating, but only when optimal. This

CHAPTER 3: PEER PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH MICRO AND MACRO DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT
type of intelligent automation keeps software fresh 
without inadvertently introducing wasted effort or 
increased security risk. This approach is proactive, 
scalable, and optimal in terms of cost efficiency 
and quality outcomes.
Selecting the Best Projects: 
Reflections on Macro 
Architectural Decisions
When developing applications in the context of 
a modern software supply chain, it is critical that 
engineering leaders define clear policies. These 
help their developers make sound architectural 
decisions as to which open source projects are 
acceptable (optimal exemplars), and which ones 
are unacceptable (suboptimal non\-exemplars).
Establishing and enforcing intelligent architectural 
policy is important for several reasons:
1\. Save time and money by standardizing which 
projects are best for you, and eliminating 
inconsistent diligence efforts associated with 
component selection.
2\. Improve application security and quality by 
standardizing on projects that are most likely 
to provide reliable access to new versions of 
non\-vulnerable dependencies. This aids with 
micro dependency decisions and helps with 
never getting stuck with “no path forward” traps.
3\. Reduce technology bloat associated with 
non\-standard decision making.
If developers made dependency update decisions 
based on a structured system of guidance, we 
would expect to see a correlation between optimal 
update decisions and exemplary projects, as well 
as suboptimal update decisions and non\-exemplary 
projects. The fact that these correlations DO NOT 
EXIST, reveals a clear opportunity for engineering 
leaders to benefit by standardizing open source 
architectural guidance at scale.
Conclusions and Practical 
Recommendations
 
⊲Based on the research, it’s clear that material 
inefficiencies exist along with significant 
avoidable risk. Software engineering teams 
have considerable room for improvement with 
respect to dependency management practices.
 
⊲To improve efficiencies, save money, and 
optimize dependency management at scale, 
engineering leaders should embrace intelligent 
automation. Chosen tools should remove the 
current error\-prone micro decision making 
from day\-to\-day developer workflows.
 
⊲Engineering leaders should also embrace 
tools to guide macro decisions made by 
architects and developers with respect 
to initial technology selection.

CHAPTER 4
 Software Supply Chain Maturity 
Less Mature 
 More Mature
UNMANAGED 
This first stage is referred to as the 
Unmanaged stage because organi\-
zations are often operating with an 
"anything goes" mindset, are often 
reactive, and have minimal process/
oversight related to the themes.
EXPLORATION
A realization of some sort is usually the 
impetus for thrusting an organization 
into the Exploration stage. This is often 
triggered by an "event" that causes an 
"all hands on deck" reaction to uncover 
necessary information/solutions, or 
a champion of some sort leading an 
improvement effort. This stage is often 
focused on identifying the perceived 
problem/inefficiency, learning about 
current implementations, and starting 
to explore potential solutions.
AD HOC 
In the midst of starting to define 
processes and implement tooling 
to improve the identified problem, 
Ad Hoc solutions reign as the teams 
work toward institutionalization 
and socialization of new tooling 
and processes.
CONTROL
In the Control stage, ad hoc solutions 
give way to more formalized 
governance processes across 
the enterprise. Socialization and insti\-
tutionalization of these processes 
and tools is ongoing, but for the most 
part, stakeholders are bought in to 
the need for improvement measures 
and are working towards compliance.
MONITOR \& MEASURE
The Monitor and Measure stage 
occurs once new processes and 
tools have been institutionalized, 
and organizations have reached a 
phase of being able to proactively 
address OSS component risk. In 
addition, a healthy amount of ROI 
is realized, and measurements to 
demonstrate success are available.
For this year’s report, we surveyed 702 engi\-
neering professionals about their software 
supply chain management practices, including 
approaches and philosophies to utilizing open 
source components, organizational design, 
governance, approval processes, and tooling. The 
survey also inquired about engineering outcomes 
including deployment frequency, security, engi\-
neering productivity, and job satisfaction. The 
responses came from IT professionals represent\-
ing a variety of roles and industries.
The objective of the survey was twofold: 
1\. Determine if certain software supply 
chain practices correlate to successful 
engineering outcomes.
2\. Develop a benchmark and maturity model 
so organizations can evaluate themselves in 
comparison to their peers.
The survey itself consisted of 41 questions:
 
⊲Ten questions were focused on understanding 
the relative quality of software outcomes 
(dependent variables).
 
⊲24 questions were focused on understanding 
patterns and practices embraced by engineering 
teams (independent variables).
 
⊲Seven questions were focused on understanding 
job satisfaction.
Responses to all 41 questions were assessed 
against the following eight elements of software 
supply chain management practices:
1\. Application inventory (Inventory) – Do you know 
all the applications your organization has in 
development/production, and who the stake\-
holders/owners are? Do you know the details 
about them, including how they are built, and 
the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for the OSS 
components they include?
2\. Supplier hygiene (Suppliers) – Do you know 
if your OSS components come from a trusted, 
quality supplier?
3\. Build \& release – Do you understand how your 
software "parts" and processes come together to 
build and release applications into production?
4\. Project consumption (Consumption) – Do you 
govern OSS component selection?
5\. Giving back (Contribution) – Do you contribute 
to the OSS community?
6\. Policy control (Risk Management) – What is 
your tolerance for risk? Do you have automated 
policy enforcement?
7\. Digital transformation (Execution Plan) – What 
plans, resources, and training do you have to 
help institutionalize new processes and tools?
FIGURE 4\.1

8\. Remediation – How do you implement fixes to 
address identified OSS component risk?
Aggregate responses were then scored and 
mapped into five different stages of software supply 
chain management maturity, as defined 
in Figure 4\.1\.
How Mature are Today’s 
Software Supply Chains? 
Based on the survey results, it’s a bit of a mixed 
bag. Let us explain. 
In Figure 4\.2, we’ve plotted the 702 responses 
against the five different stages of maturity. We 
see that, across the various themes, the majority of 
respondents were graded less than the “Control” 
level of maturity. Further, based on the definitions 
above, we can assert that the “Control” level of 
maturity is the point at which an organization 
transitions from “figuring it out” to a minimal level of 
maturity that will enable high\-quality outcomes. The 
three levels of maturity (Unmanaged, Exploration, 
Ad Hoc) prior to the “Control” level of maturity are 
suboptimal; this is where most of survey responses 
were scored. 
Reality vs. Perception on Software 
Supply Chain Maturity 
The majority of respondents demonstrate an “Ad 
Hoc” approach to software supply chain manage\-
ment for all themes except two: Remediation and 
Inventory. Respondents indicate they are remediat\-
ing risky components and they understand where 
the risk resides. This is true even though they have 
an “Ad Hoc” approach to Build \& Release and Risk 
Management processes. 
We also compared the objective analysis done in 
chapters 2 and 3, which analyzed 100,000 applica\-
tions, to the subjective survey responses. The data 
shows a clear disconnect between what is actually 
happening, and what people think is happening: 
70% of remediations are suboptimal, which aligns 
with the “Ad Hoc” maturity rating for both Risk 
Management and Execution practices.
In summary, the survey suggests that respondents 
have talked themselves into believing that they’re 
doing a good job, leading at the least to a false 
sense of security and at worst to huge inefficiencies 
in the engineering process. Objectively, however, the 
data from Chapters 2 and 3 indicates that develop\-
ment teams are not following structured guidance, 
and do not have intelligent tooling to ensure quality 
outcomes. Reconciling this perception with reality 
will help organizations in achieving the promised 
efficiency gains in dependency management.

CHAPTER 5
Emergence of Software Supply 
Chain Regulation and Standards
What’s Happening in 
the United States? 
Following the multitude of attacks in 2020 aimed at 
software supply chains, the United States Federal 
Government took notice and began to take action.
February
Starting in February 2021 — President Biden 
issued an Executive Order (EO) laying out changes 
to secure all supply chains, including software. The 
order called upon the Secretaries of Commerce 
and Homeland Security to coordinate with heads of 
appropriate agencies to report on the security and 
integrity of critical information and communications 
technology software supply chains. 
Also in February, the CIO for the Department of 
Defense (DoD CIO) rolled out a new reference 
architecture called Department of Defense (DOD), 
Zero Trust Reference Architecture (ZTA). Within the 
ZTA the DoD CIO outlined various Zero Trust Pillars 
and Capabilities including a section centered on 
protecting applications and software supply chains. 
The reference architecture specifically calls for 
protection of Applications and Workloads, defined as: 
Applications and workloads include tasks 
on systems or services on\-premises, as 
well as applications or services running in 
a cloud environment. Zero Trust workloads 
span the complete application stack from 
application layer to hypervisor. Securing 
and properly managing the application 
layer, as well as compute containers and 
virtual machines is central to Zero Trust 
adoption. Application delivery methods such 
as proxy technologies, enable additional 
protections to include Zero Trust decision 
and enforcement points. Developed Source 
Code and common libraries are vetted 
through DevSecOps development practices 
to secure applications from inception.
The document further defines software supply 
chain protection as:
The ability to validate the security on a 
binary, library, or source code used to build 
an application.
April
In April 2021, the United States saw the formaliza\-
tion of software supply chain standards begin to 
take shape when the CISA and National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST) released 
their paper “Defending Against Software Supply 
Chain Attacks” 
In it, the two agencies highlighted that software 
compromised in supply chain attacks could have 
“widespread consequences for government, 
critical infrastructure, and private sector software 
customers.” They also noted how these types of 
attacks can easily allow bad actors to get around 
other cyber defenses to carry out cyber espionage. 
The document provides in\-depth guidance for 
both governments and companies to implement 
reasonable safeguards to secure their software 
supply chains. 
Suggestions include:
 
⊲Developing a written program to address 
software supply chain risk.
 
⊲Inventorying organizational reliance on 
external software and code across all 
operational departments.
 
⊲Assessing risk from these vendors and adopting 
appropriate contractual and other safeguards.
 
⊲Coordinating efforts across management, IT, 
personnel, compliance, product development 
and operational departments.
 
⊲Monitoring the threats and vulnerabilities to the 
software supply chain, including through techni\-
cal measures and threat analysis, on an ongoing 
basis.
May
In May 2021, Biden signed a second Executive 
Order for software supply chains, this time, as part of 
a critical look at the nation’s cybersecurity posture. 
The EO “on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity” is 
a milestone for the U.S. government.
The EO prescribed a number of technologies, 
including multi\-factor encryption and endpoint 
detection as critical to protecting the nation's cyber 
assets. Further, the EO established a detailed plan 
for taking steps to secure the federal software

supply chain. The order called for NIST to publish 
guidelines for establishing best practices to detect 
vulnerabilities, and requirements that all critical 
software delivered to government customers 
including an SBOM. It also included milestones 
that agencies must meet to demonstrate progress 
toward the goals.
June
In June 2021, as directed by the EO, NIST released 
their definition of “critical software” defining it as: 
\[...] any software that has, or has direct 
software dependencies upon, one or more 
components with at least one of these 
attributes:
 
⊲is designed to run with elevated privilege or 
manage privileges;
 
⊲has direct or privileged access to networking 
or computing resources;
 
⊲is designed to control access to data or 
operational technology;
 
⊲performs a function critical to trust; or,
 
⊲operates outside of normal trust boundaries 
with privileged access.
The definition applies to software of all forms (e.g., 
standalone software, software integral to specific 
devices or hardware components, cloud\-based 
software) purchased for, or deployed in, production 
systems and used for operational purposes.
July
In July 2021, NIST published guidance for outlining 
security measures for critical software use and 
minimum standards for vendors’ testing of their 
software source code. 
Also in July, the National Telecommunications 
and Information Administration (NTIA) released a 
minimum definition of an SBOM. This was a critical 
step toward improving transparency for software 
supply chains for both technology vendors and 
government customers.
The NTIA describes an SBOM as “effectively a 
nested inventory, a list of ingredients that make 
up software components, and provides those who 
produce, purchase, and operate software with infor\-
mation that enhances their understanding of the 
supply chain. SBOMs are a formal, machine\-read\-
able inventory of software components and 
dependencies. SBOMs contain information 
about those components, and their hierarchical 
relationships. SBOMs may include open source or 
proprietary software and can be widely available or 
access\-restricted.”
Further, NTIA defined the minimum elements for a 
SBOM as three broad, interrelated areas:
1\. Data Fields: Documenting baseline information 
about each component that should be tracked.
2\. Automation Support: Allowing for scaling across 
the software ecosystem through automatic 
generation and machine\-readability.
3\. Practices and Processes: Defining the opera\-
tions of SBOM requests, generation, and use.
Furthermore in July, both the House of 
Representatives and the Senate began drafting 
legislation in two separate committees.
The House’s Homeland Security Committee intro\-
duced seven bipartisan bills, five of which focused 
strictly on strengthening cybersecurity, including 
a “Pipeline Security Act,” and “Cybersecurity 
Vulnerability Remediation Act.”
The Senate’s Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs Committee introduced The Supply Chain 
Security Training Act, calling it, “bipartisan legisla\-
tion to help protect against cybersecurity threats and 
other technological supply chain security vulner\-
abilities that arise when the federal government 
purchases services, equipment or products.
What’s Happening in the 
United Kingdom? 
In May 2021, the U.K. government announced that 
it was seeking advice on defending against digital 
supply chain attacks from organizations that either 
consume IT services, or MSPs that provide software 
and services. 
“As supply chains 
become interconnected, 
vulnerabilities in suppliers’ 
products and services ... 
become more attractive 
targets for attackers.”
— U.K. government’s request for advice on 
 defending against digital supply chain attacks ­

C H A P T E R 5 : E M E R G E N C E O F S O F T WA R E S U P P LY C H A I N R E G U L AT I O N A N D S TA N DA R D S
The request noted: 
"As supply chains become interconnected, 
vulnerabilities in suppliers' products and 
services correspondingly become more 
attractive targets for attackers who want 
to gain access to the organisations. Recent 
high\-profile cyber incidents where attackers 
have used MSPs as a means to attack 
companies are a stark reminder that cyber 
threat actors are more than capable of 
exploiting vulnerabilities in supply chain 
security, and seemingly small players in an 
organisation's supply chain can introduce 
disproportionately high levels of cyber risk."
Also in May, the Department for Digital, Culture, 
Media, and Sport (DCMS) opened up a survey that 
closed in early July, and invited comments from 
industry experts and tech organizations on step\-
ping up supply chain security across the UK.
The initiative is a part of the U.K.’s nationwide 
"cyber resilience" efforts set out in its National 
Cyber Security Strategy to safeguard businesses 
and organizations that increasingly rely on technol\-
ogy from cyber\-attacks, and to strengthen overall 
digital supply chain security.
While the feedback has not been released to the 
public yet, the U.K. government has noted that it 
will result in the re\-evaluation of supply chain risks, 
reviewing policies, and likely implementing new 
guidelines and frameworks to strengthen specific 
areas of digital supply chain security. It could also 
mean the introduction of new, country\-wide legisla\-
tion for software firms and IT service providers. 
What’s Happening in Germany? 
In May 2021, Germany passed the Information 
Technology Security Act 2\.0 as an update to the 
First Act to “increase cyber and information security 
against the backdrop of increasingly frequent and 
complex cyber\-attacks and the continued digital\-
isation of everyday life.” While this Act influences 
many areas of the IT industry in Germany, it spe\-
cifically states that suppliers, i.e. manufacturers of 
critical components, will also be subject to certain 
obligations to safeguard the entire supply chain. 
Critical components are defined as IT products:
1\. that are used in critical infrastructures; 
2\. for which disruptions to availability, integrity, 
authenticity, and confidentiality may lead to a 
failure or a significant impairment of the func\-
tionality of critical infrastructures or to threats to 
public safety; and 
3\. that on the basis of a law regarding this provision 
are designated as a critical component, or 
realize a function designated as critical on the 
basis of a law.
What’s Happening in the 
European Union? 
In July 2021, the ENISA issued a report titled 
“Understanding the increase in Supply Chain 
Security Attacks” that reviewed 24 different 
software supply chain attacks and how they came 
to fruition. 
It found that: 
 
⊲“In order to compromise the targeted customers, 
attackers focused on the suppliers’ code in about 
66% of the reported incidents.” 
 
⊲“For 58% of the supply chain incidents analysed, 
the customer assets targeted were predominantly 
customer data, including Personally Identifiable 
Information (PII) data and intellectual property.” 
 
⊲“For 66% of the supply chain attacks analysed, 
suppliers did not know, or failed to report on how 
they were compromised. However, less than 9% of 
the customers compromised through supply chain 
attacks did not know how the attacks occurred.” 
More importantly, the report shared recommen\-
dations that organizations should put in place. 
While more guidance than regulation, it does 
foreshadow what could come down the road. 
Suggestions include: 
 
⊲identifying and documenting suppliers and 
service providers;
 
⊲defining risk criteria for different types of suppli\-
ers and services such as supplier and customer 
dependencies, critical software dependencies, 
single points of failure;
“Attackers focused 
on the suppliers’ code 
in about 66% of the 
reported incidents.”

⊲monitoring of supply chain risks and threats;
 
⊲managing suppliers over the whole lifecycle of 
a product or service, including procedures to 
handle end\-of\-life products or components;
 
⊲classifying of assets and information shared with 
or accessible to suppliers, and defining relevant 
procedures for accessing and handling them.
The report also suggests possible actions to assure 
that the development of products and services 
comply with security practices. Suppliers are 
advised to implement better policies for vulnerabil\-
ity and patch management. 
Recommendations for suppliers include:
 
⊲ensuring that the infrastructure used to design, 
develop, manufacture, and deliver products, compo\-
nents and services follows cybersecurity practices;
 
⊲implementing a product development, maintenance, 
and support process that is consistent with com\-
monly accepted product development processes;
 
⊲monitoring of security vulnerabilities reported by 
internal and external sources that includes used 
third\-party components;
 
⊲maintaining an inventory of assets that includes 
patch\-relevant information.
What’s Happening Globally?
May 
In May 2021, the United Nations released a 
report two years in the making from “the Group of 
Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible 
State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of 
international security.” 
Similar to actions at the national and regional 
levels, the report touches on several areas of 
cybersecurity, and provides guidance on the 
“reasonable steps States should take to ensure the 
integrity of the supply chain so that end users can 
have confidence in the security of information and 
communication technology (ICT) products.” 
The report notes: 
Ensuring the integrity of the ICT supply 
chain and the security of ICT products, and 
preventing the proliferation of malicious ICT 
tools and techniques and the use of harmful 
hidden functions are increasingly critical in that 
regard, as well as to international security, and 
digital and broader economic development. 
Global ICT supply chains are extensive, 
increasingly complex and interdependent, 
and involve many different parties. 
Reasonable steps to promote openness 
and ensure the integrity, stability and 
security of the supply chain can include: 
(a) Putting in place at the national level 
comprehensive, transparent, objective and 
impartial frameworks and mechanisms for 
supply chain risk management, consistent 
with a State’s international obligations. 
(b) Establishing policies and programmes to 
objectively promote the adoption of good 
practices by suppliers and vendors of ICT 
equipment and systems in order to build 
international confidence in the integrity 
and security of ICT products and services, 
enhance quality and promote choice. 
(c) Increased attention in national policy 
and in dialogue with States and relevant 
actors at the United Nations and other fora 
on how to ensure all States can compete 
and innovate on an equal footing, so as to 
enable the full realization of ICTs to increase 
global social and economic development and 
contribute to the maintenance of international 
peace and security, while also safeguarding 
national security and the public interest. 
You can read the full list of guidance provided by 
the United Nations.
June
In June 2021, the United States and the European 
Union formed a Trade and Technology Council 
(TTC). This was in part developed to work together 
on the fight to secure critical technology and 
software supply chains. According to the White 
House, the TTC “will be composed of working 
groups focused on advancing cooperation on tech 
standards on artificial intelligence, the internet 
of things and other emerging technologies, ICT 
security, data governance, investment screening 
and semiconductors.”
