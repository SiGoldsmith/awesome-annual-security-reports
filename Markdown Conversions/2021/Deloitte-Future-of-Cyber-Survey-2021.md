### Methodology
The Deloitte 2021 Future of
Cyber Survey, conducted by
both Deloitte and Wakefield
Research, polled nearly 600
C-level executives about
cybersecurity at companies with
at least $500 million in annual
revenue including nearly 200
CISOs, 100 CIOs, 100 CEOs, 100
CFOs, and 100 CMOs between
June 6 – August 24, 2021 using
an online survey.

The state of play
In order to remain competitive, today’s enterprises run
an array of technologies that combine on-premises
infrastructure with hybrid information technology (IT)
and an assortment of third-party cloud providers. These
sophisticated integrated environments require new
forms of management distinct from traditional in-house
IT architectures. A clear plurality of the CIOs and CISOs
we surveyed (41%) acknowledge that transformation
and gaining visibility across increasingly complex
hybrid ecosystems is the greatest challenge they face.
In addition to the pressures of the marketplace, the
pandemic heralds the arrival of remote work as a
permanent feature of employment. Organizations, large
and small, have rapidly transformed work environments
and in doing so dramatically increased their attack
surfaces, often with little to no time to consider security
implications. Not surprisingly, there’s been an uptick in
attacks, with 69% of respondents reporting an increase
or significant increase in threats to their business
between early 2020 and May 2021 – this was consistent
across industries and geographies. 32% of our global
C-suite respondents indicated operational disruption
was the greatest impact, followed by intellectual
property (IP) theft (22%) and drops in share price (19%).
Today, we find ourselves living the
reality of a cyber everywhere world where
digital transformation initiatives continue
to accelerate amid the emergence of
a pervasive remote workforce. It often
appears as if technological innovation and
the culture it produces are surging ahead
of our ability to understand, measure and
respond to exponentially increasing risk.
Despite the elevated risk environment, digital transformation and
migration to the cloud continue to be priorities for our clients. More
than simply improving efficiency, as data flows across organizations
it drives new ways of value creation, connecting lines of business
and using customer data to enrich experiences. Our survey data
underscores this migration—94% of CFO respondents indicated
they are considering moving their financial systems or enterprise
resource planning (ERP) to the cloud.

*Respondents were asked to select up to two responses, so percentages will not add up to 100%.

Never trust. Always verify.
When asked, What are the greatest barriers to
managing cybersecurity across their organizations?
Respondents ranked data management traversing
complex perimeters the highest (44%), followed by
a need for better prioritization of cyber risk across
the enterprise (31%). Fortunately, it’s now feasible
to deploy Zero Trust architecture, which replaces
simple verification of entities with real-time access
decisions based on continuous risk assessment.
When implemented it is an effective response to
the dissolution of perimeters in today’s ecosystems,
recognizing that every component in an architecture
is vulnerable and every layer needs protection.
Made possible by recent advances in computational
power, Zero Trust’s emergence and adoption point
to wider cultural shifts in organizations that reveal
how the role of cyber is changing and its importance
elevating. More than a technological fix, Zero Trust’s
set of interwoven solutions provide visibility into
adversarial activity, associated business risk, and insight
into changes needed to reduce the risk. This insight
demands coordination between IT and business lines
as well as enterprise-wide education and training.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

> “We’re in a period of transition
and rapid evolution. Two
of the biggest challenges
businesses face are hybrid IT and
transformation. That’s creating a
much more diverse environment
and driving up complexity.
Greater visibility, particularly
into cloud deployments, is the
number one thing organizations
are looking for.”

Realigning your defenses
As hackers grow more sophisticated and understand the market
value of assets—whether it’s pharmaceutical IP, engineering and
product patents, customer or other critical data—organizations
continue to step up their cyber defense budgets. Almost 75% of
respondents who had more than $30B in revenue said they will
spend more than $100M on cybersecurity this year.
The challenge is to ensure this expenditure results in greater visibility into the amplified risk of today’s
increasingly complex ecosystems. Beyond acquiring technology and expertise, it requires organizational
change to facilitate programmatic governance that extends beyond the enterprise to include partners
and third-party providers.
As technology changes, so does the role of the CISO. Once cyber permeates an enterprise, it’s imperative to
reposition where the CISO sits in the organization chart. Beyond simplifying reporting, closer relationships
to the CEO enhance the CISO’s ability to understand business priorities and to have visibility into innovations
as they occur. This new operational role of the CISO with greater engagement across the organization
enables the cyber team to ensure necessary requirements, technical solutions and controls can be built
into innovation initiatives from the ground up. This not only minimizes risk at the outset but risk of overall
product and service development.
This deeper cultural impact of cyber is why in this year’s edition we’ve expanded the current survey beyond
leaders with direct oversight for cyber to include those who should be cyber’s greatest champions: CEOs,
CFOs, CMOs, CIOs and CISOs. Their sentiments are similar to one another, with variations seen across
geographies and industries.
The view to the future
There is no simple solution, organizational or technological, to gaining visibility into the growing
complexity of integrated ecosystems that underpin modern business. However, there are a number of
measures, organizational, cultural and operational, when taken together, that can enable organizations
to embed cyber in the core of their business initiatives, in their culture and into their continuously
evolving technology ecosystems.
In this report, we explore some of those measures and underscore the importance of organizations’
ability to gain visibility into the risk which complexity creates now, and into the future as the next wave
of technological evolution continues to increase our interconnectivity.

## DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
### Cyber and the challenge of transformation

Understanding cyber risk
Because today’s cyber threats impact entire businesses, potentially
crippling operations and rapidly destroying hard-won reputations, it is vital
that boards assess cyber risk in terms they can understand. They need to
be able to compare cyber threats to risks they are experienced at handling.
Analyzing cyber risk profiles should be as familiar as grasping the health of
their balance sheet.
Once they can comprehend the nature and scale of the cyber risks they
are exposed to, they will know where to invest to best mitigate dangers.
According to our survey, 41% of respondents indicated cyber maturity
assessments are used to guide cyber investment decisions, 35% said they
employ risk quantification tools, and 23% say they rely on the experience of
the company’s cyber leadership. When asked how often they conduct risk
analyses/threat modeling for new and/or existing applications, 37% of CIOs
and CISOs indicated they do so quarterly, and 29% do so monthly. While
the responsibility for these assessments typically falls to CIOs and CISOs,
it is critical the broader set of stakeholders understand the relevance and
importance of such efforts.
Across every industry, remaining competitive requires new services
and products be rapidly developed and brought to market.
Much more than simply digitizing existing processes,
innovative business models are enveloping supply chains
and creating novel realms of customer experience.
This transformation also exposes enterprises to new
forms of cyber risk, requiring new cyber strategies
to protect evolving business models. To manage these
risks, C-suite and Board members need to embrace
the change, create effective governance across lines of
business, and evolve risk management processes to
achieve end-to-end visibility of all newly connected areas
of business, including those run by third parties. Success
depends upon the commitment of senior management,
their ability to understand cyber risk followed by effective
investment in security.
When asked to rank their digital transformation
initiatives in the next 12 months, survey respondents
rated data analytics number one (16%), followed by
cloud (15%) and new or upgraded ERP programs
(15%) as their top priorities. The addition of the
operational technology/industrial control systems
(OT/ICS) response option and resulting response
selection (14% designated this as a top priority) to
this year’s survey is indicative of the efforts we are
seeing across industry to digitize and modernize
factories and operating technology environments.
The speed and scale of change is truly revolutionary.
When the world rushed online at the advent of COVID-19
this became immediately apparent. Entire business sectors
were transformed almost instantly as huge sections of the
workforce suddenly began operating remotely. Fortunately,
much of the required digital ecosystem—from cloud and
shadow IT to ICS—was already in place and ready to scale
up rapidly. But less obvious are the myriad cyber risks
underlying this transformation, and few businesses currently
possess the means to understand and mitigate them to an
acceptable level.

Building the right cyber team
It’s not realistic to expect board
members or the C-suite to become
cybersecurity experts. But it’s up to the
board to build a cyber team that gives
them the visibility they need and to
provide pertinent information in terms
they can understand. The key hiring
decision needs to occur at the board or
senior management level.

*The following is a bar chart displaying how organizations are spending their cyber budget. The Y axis is a percentage and the X axis is a list of areas. The areas are: Threat detection and monitoring (13%), Data security (12%), Cyber transformation (12%), Identity solutions (11%), Application security (11%), Infrastructure security (11%), Incident response/disaster recovery (10%), Cloud migration and integration (10%), Internet of Things (10%).*

Full speed ahead?
The pressure to compete at scale very often
means business leaders’ digital transformation
efforts focus on outcomes without fully
contemplating cyber risks. Beating the
competition to market creates tunnel vision
with significant blind spots.
With cyber permeating everywhere from
customer touchpoints to intelligent factories
and the remote devices of employees, the days
of a siloed IT department managing antivirus
software and passwords are over. It’s no longer
enough to just keep the network running,
broader and deeper thinking is required.
Today’s CISO now needs the authority to
influence all the lines of business, gather
information from across the enterprise and
be able to communicate directly with the
board and senior management. Not to mention
the investment of resources and talent to
adequately safeguard the organization’s most
strategic priorities and assets.
This is often a hard sell to the CFO, as what you
hope to show from a large cyber investment
is usually…nothing. Meaning, zero cyber
incidents is money well spent. So how are
CISOs planning their cyber budgets? In 2019,
CISOs and CIOs told us that their cyber budget
was evenly spread across various cyber
programs. In 2021, this hasn’t changed—CISO
and CIO respondents again reported budgets
are similarly divided. C-suite leaders should
understand that to manage cyber risk there is
not a one and done solution.
Therefore, cyber budgets are increasing with
greater attention given to threat intelligence,
detection and monitoring, cyber transformation
plus data security. Across the globe, CISOs
and CIOs are consistently investing in scaled
cyber solutions in/for the cloud; cyber/technical
resilience; and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven
threat assessment and identification, to build
their organizations’ cyber defense.

## CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
### Individualized or intrusive? Using personal data ethically

*The following is a pie chart displaying the responses to the question "Are you able to measure and demonstrate compliance with global data privacy regulations?". The responses are: Yes (85%), No (11%), Don't know/unsure (4%).*

People expect personalized, targeted experiences. We want everything
from food delivery to travel and healthcare to be frictionless, based on our
past interactions. What we don’t want is the sense we’re being followed
everywhere by marketers feeding us an endless diet of coupons for things
we’re not interested in.
How companies manage customer data, connect online and in-person experiences while protecting privacy can be the
difference between profit or loss and even long-term survival.
Are you able to measure and demonstrate
compliance with global data privacy regulations?

Privacy by design
For every customer-facing project, it’s important to take
privacy and security into account at the beginning. Ask yourself,
how important for our business model is having this degree
of intimacy with our customers? Carefully think through the type
of information you need to provide the right level of service. Then
understand who needs to access it and how it will be stored and
protected. When we asked Chief Marketing Officers if they were
able to measure and demonstrate compliance with global data
privacy regulations, the majority (85%) responded that they could.
Avoid data bloat
Simply harvesting reams of data in the hope that it’s useful in
the future is a drag on resources and likely a recipe for failure.
Customers resent giving up personal information when they
don’t clearly see a benefit. Collecting and effectively using data
to create authentic, personalized and human experiences is a
catalyst for growth. The flip side is the more data you have, the
more risk you encounter. It’s all about balance. When asked,
the CMOs we polled were evenly split between answering it
was more important to collect data to personalize customer
experience versus more important not to collect personal
data in order to protect against a breach.

In your opinion, how well do you feel your marketing organization
balances data collection with engendering consumer trust?

Value and trust
Today, people realize their personal data has
intrinsic value. They see handing it over as an
investment and want to know what is the return:
providing personal information should make life
easier. Like anything of worth, it must also be safe
and secure. Also, people are demanding agency,
seeking to choose how and when then their data
is used. When companies reliably deliver on their
promises, customer relationships deepen.
The extent customers trust your company is reflected
in their behavior. High trust scores correlate closely
with repeat business—their chance of buying again
rises 540% when they believe companies are reliable.
Perhaps just as significantly, they will support
you strongly on social media. As a result, trusted
businesses greatly outperform the rest—for example,
trusted companies were 2x more resilient during
the past year.*
According to our survey, 91% of CMOs stated they
feel their organizations balance data collection with
engendering trust either “very well” or “somewhat well.”
Such a high confidence level begs the question, is this
view shared by other C-suite members? It certainly
points to the need for a collaborative approach to
ensure blind spots aren’t overlooked.
Ethics over regulation
Increasingly, consumers are deploying their
purchasing power to support companies with
sustainable environmental policies and are proactive
on social issues. Their concern also applies to how
companies use personal data.
Traditionally, companies have sought guidance from
regulators about what they should and shouldn’t do.
While compliance with the various laws around the
globe is vital, it’s no longer sufficient to just assume
people are willing to share personal data at all if you
cannot explain the purpose. Plus, the explanation
needs to be in plain language and easily understood.
Regardless of location, companies who bring
trust into their DNA and clearly communicate
their willingness to adhere to the privacy rights of
customers are benefitting from greater faithfulness.
Making it easy for customers to access, delete or
move their data should be part of your simple and
straightforward user agreement. When customers
see that a company thinks through its data policies
and can chart its own course, they are more willing
to put their data onboard.

Into the breach
Despite taking the greatest precautions, data breaches happen. It’s
wise to consider them an eventuality and be prepared. Getting caught
flatfooted will make a bad situation worse. How you respond sends clear
signals about your brand. Not only should you rehearse an incident
response plan alongside your cyber team testing scenarios around
a data breach but also collaborate on the recovery plan and related
communications strategy.
According to our survey, CMOs indicated that work is being done to fully
align with the cyber organization with 46% saying they participate in such
planning and testing once a quarter. Global responses vary with CMOs in
Argentina, Germany and Australia revealing a higher level of integration
with cyber teams over other countries.
When a breach does occur, regard it as your obligation to fully inform
customers about what has occurred. Clearly outline the services you are
providing in response and think about which channels of communication
best convey your message: Does it warrant a personal letter from the
CEO? A gift? Or other compensation?
Despite the gravity of the circumstances, deftly communicating with your
customers can also be an opportunity to deepen your relationship with
them. Handling a difficult situation well by putting the interests of your
customers first can help your reputation to quickly rebound and inspire
even greater trust.
Dissolve the silos
CMOs and experience officers tend to make decisions based on brand and marketing
requirements and only at the very end check with the CISO if data has been gathered correctly
(and usually, the answer is, “No!”). Everyone is on a different team. One team sees their job as
gathering as much data as they can, the other wants to only gather what’s necessary and protect
it. A better approach is to examine together what is the right balance between capturing the
information required to deliver a seamless experience and the need to mitigate risk for both
the company and its customers. Before using data to connect the dots of customer experience,
organizations need people who can make connections outside of their silos. It’s a two-way street.
When designing privacy policies and communications, bring in marketing. This is increasingly
central to brand intentions and messaging, so they can help.

LEADER, DELOITTE CYBER

In legacy environments, IT resources were contained within clearly defined
boundaries. Whatever resided externally was untrusted and all internal
traffic was inherently trusted. And now? We live in a hyper-connected
world, where everything is increasingly interconnected. The perimeter
has essentially dissolved for most modern enterprises.
72% of survey respondents indicated their organizations experienced between one and 10 cyber incidents and breaches
in the last year alone. When securing the enterprise, we can no longer inherently trust anything. The challenge today
becomes, “how can you remove inherent trust altogether?” It’s a revolutionary change to the way we build modern security
architectures. Fortunately, Zero Trust has the capabilities to meet the task.

Finally, we have the power to compute and the technology to inform

It’s no longer binary: Allow or Deny. Every connection request can
be verified against a set of contextual factors to derive a risk-based
access decision:
•	Is the source connection from an authenticated
and authorized user?
•	Is it coming from a known and secure device?
•	Does this person usually connect from this
geographic location?
•	Is the time of connection consistent with the user’s history?
•	Are there any other signals or threat intelligence that should
be taken into consideration before access is granted?

Enter Zero Trust
Zero Trust is not a technology or a single solution. It is a set of architectural policies that are based on the fundamental
principle of “never trust, always verify”. The concept commits to shifting from the traditional perimeter-based or “castle and
moat approach” of managing security, to one where trust is established between individual resources and consumers, as
and when required. With Zero Trust, trusted connections are established based on internal and external factors, which are
constantly revalidated.

Step by step
Most companies—knowingly or unknowingly— have embarked on a Zero
Trust trajectory. Their approaches differ by the degree they are tactical,
architectural or strategically led. While Zero Trust is relevant across all
industries and sectors, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Zero Trust is
a multiyear initiative—a transformational change, that breaks down the
silos between business, IT and the various cyber domains. Any Zero Trust
journey will face pitfalls and obstacles requiring strong leadership support,
investment and buy-in from across your organization to ensure success.
Consideration needs to be given to the business drivers, existing capabilities,
and use cases relevant to your organization. It’s important to keep cyber
fundamentals in mind: What are you trying to protect? Where do those
assets reside? Who (identities) and what (devices) should be able to access
those assets, and under what conditions? To answer these questions,
organizations need to prioritize IT asset management and data governance
capabilities to understand the classification and criticality of their assets and
data…and leverage this context when creating access control policies. Then
defining your goals and embedding them in your end-to-end strategy is the
surest way to achieve your desired business outcomes. This, however, isn’t
easy. When asked about their biggest challenge in managing cybersecurity
across their organization, “increase of data management/perimeter and
complexities” was the number one hurdle cited by respondents.
Much more than a technology solution, Zero Trust is a cultural change. The
change to the overall organization cannot be underestimated. Softer factors
such as communications, role-specific training, awareness, and operational
process adjustments are key elements for success. Overall, such programs
require a strategy aligned to the business, supported by strong leadership,
dedicated architecture, technical workstreams and compelling pilots, that
coalesce the commitment across all stakeholders.
The road ahead
Tech giants are leading the Zero Trust maturity journey and apply these
principles to develop, run and deliver secure services. Other leading
organizations are adopting Zero-Trust strategies to support business
priorities, digital transformation, and corporate risk strategies. When
modernizing your own architectures, understanding how the leaders
innovated and achieved tremendous scale can help drive your digital
transformation, too. There is no doubt the change is happening. The
sooner you take charge of your transition to Zero Trust, the safer the
journey will be. It’s far better to be in the driver’s seat, determining your
destination…the time for Zero Trust is now.
The current situation
Our 2021 survey outlines the challenges of managing cyber risk across the enterprise faced by
CIOs and CISOs. Their greatest challenges are transformation and Hybrid IT, with cyber hygiene,
talent limitations and shadow IT not far behind. Those challenges will only get more complex
through accelerated digital transformations. We must start over and build security architectures
that can sustain the increasing speed of digital transformation. The time to act is now!

Headlines often focus on cutting-edge technologies like quantum
computing, 5G, and digital twins but the full spectrum also
includes brownfield technologies, like operational technology,
that have existed for decades in the manufacturing environment.
What’s “emerging,” whether the technology is brand new or has long been deployed, is its connection
to the Internet, and how the physical and digital worlds are becoming connected in nearly every way
imaginable. We’re witnessing a digital metamorphosis across everything from medical devices to
transportation to agriculture and beyond. Not only is it transforming the way we make and use almost
everything, but it brings security risks that were never conceivable before.
When CIOs and CISOs ranked what will drive their adoption of emerging technologies in the next
three years, security capabilities came out on top (64%), followed by enhancing data privacy capabilities
(59%), and compliance capabilities (50%).

Out of sight. But in touch.
For small all-digital organizations, a single view of cyber risk is still
possible. In the short term, for larger entities with complex
interconnected ecosystems that’s no longer a reality. The solution
is letting each party assume security responsibility and accountability
for the processes under its purview. When everybody is effectively
covering their part of the ecosystem making that more secure, overall
risk reduces, even if there is no holistic view of it.
The speed with which entities can do that differs based on the type and
complexity of technologies, but the idea is to effectively cover the basics
of security and safely share information. Right now, the fix is simple. Over
the long run, organizations should keep in mind there is a lot to gain in
efficiency and effectiveness if processes are aligned between areas. The
sooner that alignment happens, the faster higher security maturity can be
reached. Both centralized and decentralized models can be effective but
they should ultimately combine into an
