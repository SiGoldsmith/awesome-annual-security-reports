## Executive Summary
For yet another year, OverWatch disrupted a record number of interactive intrusion attempts[2] by identifying malicious activity early and stopping adversaries in their tracks. This report shares insights from OverWatch’s around-the-clock threat hunting from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021.[3]

This year's report starts with a close look at OverWatch's extensive dataset covering observed interactive threat actor behaviors, which we will refer to in this report as "intrusion activity". It uses this data to examine how threat actors are operating in victim environments, highlighting both rare and common techniques that adversaries are employing.

The mission of OverWatch is to augment the powerful autonomous protection of the Falcon platform with human expertise. With the combined power of human ingenuity and patent-protected work flows, OverWatch systematically sifts through 1 trillion daily events to find potential hands-on intrusions, on average 1 every 8 minutes. OverWatch operates with speed and at scale to notify victim organizations of malicious activity in near real time, ensuring intrusion attempts that incorporate novel tradecraft are identified and disrupted before the breach.

Key findings from this year’s report include:

*   OverWatch has tracked a 60% increase in interactive intrusion activity in the past year. The threat of hands-on intrusion activity remains very real — OverWatch has observed and disrupted intrusions spanning all industry verticals and geographic regions.
*   Adversaries have moved beyond malware. They are using increasingly sophisticated and stealthy techniques tailor-made to evade autonomous detections — of all of the detections indexed by CrowdStrike Threat Graph® in the past three months, 68% were malware-free.
*   ECrime continues to dominate the threat landscape, making up 75% of interactive intrusion activity. One driver of this has been the continually evolving big game hunting (BGH) business model, which has seen the widespread adoption of both the use of access brokers to facilitate access, and the use of dedicated leak sites to extract payment.
*   ECrime adversaries are moving with increasing speed in pursuit of their objectives. OverWatch observations show they are capable of moving laterally within a victim environment in an average of 1 hour and 32 minutes.
*   Targeted intrusion adversaries remain a prominent threat, particularly for the telecommunications industry. While organizations of all sizes and in all verticals have the potential to become a target, the telecommunications industry stood out this year, accounting for 40% of all state-nexus intrusion activity observed by OverWatch in the past 12 months.

This report shares insights into the latest adversary tradecraft, gleaned from OverWatch’s extensive intrusion dataset.

[2] The term “interactive” denotes hands-on adversary activity.
[3] The terms “this year” or “this past year” used throughout the report refer to the period from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021.

This report features detailed case studies sharing insights into the hands-on activity that OverWatch tracks on a daily basis and concludes with recommendations for defenders looking to bolster their security program.

Note that this report’s findings relate to interactive (i.e., hands-on) targeted intrusions[4] and eCrime intrusions that OverWatch tracks and are not necessarily representative of the full spectrum of attacks that are stopped by OverWatch or the Falcon platform.

Moreover, the term “intrusion” is used to describe any malicious interactive activity that OverWatch uncovers in a victim environment. The term “intrusion” is not synonymous with a “security breach” and should not be understood to mean that the threat actor was able to achieve their objectives.

[4] The term “targeted intrusion” in this report refers to state-nexus or other advanced persistent threat actors.

## The Value of Continuous Threat Hunting
The CrowdStrike Falcon platform has proven unequivocally in dozens of independent tests to be a highly effective solution for protecting endpoints from modern threats. Still, no technology is 100% effective at blocking determined intruders.

According to data from our customer base indexed by Threat Graph, 68% of detections from the last three months were not malware-based. Attackers are increasingly attempting to accomplish their objectives without writing malware to the endpoint, using legitimate credentials and built-in tools (living off the land) — which are deliberate efforts to evade detection by traditional antivirus products.

OverWatch is on a mission to find threats that technology on its own cannot. Threat hunting takes place at the front lines of the battle between adversaries and defenders. Each year OverWatch sees more adversaries, new tradecraft and faster intrusions. In this context, finding the threat is only half the battle; using those insights to disrupt adversaries at scale is where the battle is won.

In the 12 months from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021, OverWatch’s human threat hunters directly identified more than 65,000 potential intrusions, or approximately 1 potential intrusion every 8 minutes — 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This represents thousands of instances where OverWatch analysts uncovered adversaries actively seeking to evade autonomous detection techniques. When considered alongside adversaries’ demonstrated ability to begin moving through victim environments in just minutes — shown throughout this report — these numbers drive home the criticality of continuous threat hunting.

OverWatch is on a mission to find threats that technology on its own cannot.

**65,000** potential intrusions were identified and stopped with the help of Falcon OverWatch

**8 minutes** is the average interval at which OverWatch threat hunters uncovered potential intrusions

**68% of detections** from the last three months were not malware-based

Crucially, each of these potential intrusions also represents an opportunity to advance the autonomous detection techniques in the Falcon platform. With each pass through the OverWatch SEARCH threat hunting cycle, hunters hone the Falcon platform’s ability to detect similar intrusions more quickly and autonomously. Over the last year, threat hunters distilled their findings into the development of hundreds of new behavioral-based preventions, resulting in the direct prevention of malicious activity on approximately 248,000 unique endpoints. These behavioral-based preventions enhance the power of the Falcon platform to uncover novel adversary behavior with greater speed and scale.

With the right data and tools, a small team of experts can not only stop today's most sophisticated intrusions but also develop insights that drive continuous advancement at every level of the security organization.

## OverWatch SEARCH Hunting Methodology
OverWatch finds threats that technology on its own cannot. Human-led threat hunting does not replace autonomous detection technologies — rather, it explicitly sets out to complement and augment technology-based defenses to ensure that defenders have the power of human ingenuity on their side.

OverWatch threat hunters employ the “SEARCH” hunting methodology, described below, to systematically detect threats at scale. Working around the clock, OverWatch threat hunters methodically sift through a world of unknown unknowns to find the faintest traces of malicious activity and deliver actionable analysis to CrowdStrike customers in near real time. The OverWatch SEARCH methodology shines a light into the darkest corners of customers’ environments — leaving adversaries with nowhere to hide.

### Threat Hunting Methodology

CrowdStrike’s rich telemetry creates the foundation for OverWatch threat hunting. Upward of 1 trillion events per day, comprising hundreds of event types from millions of endpoints, are collected and cataloged by the Falcon platform to provide comprehensive visibility into activity across the CrowdStrike install base.

CrowdStrike's proprietary Threat Graph contextualizes events and reveals relationships between data points in real time. Threat hunters add a further dimension to the data by drawing on CrowdStrike’s up-to-the-minute threat intelligence about the tradecraft of more than 160 adversary groups, as well as by using their intimate working knowledge of the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in use in the wild. All of this is underpinned by OverWatch’s proprietary tools and processes, which ensure every hunt is optimized for maximum efficiency.

OverWatch analysts use a mix of patent-protected hunting workflows and complex statistical methods to identify anomalous activity. This is supported by a deep understanding of adversary behaviors and motivations, enabling the team to form hypotheses about where adversaries may strike. The breadth and depth of experience on the OverWatch team is world class, with representation from every corner of public and private industry. Further, the team is continuously building its knowledge base, going toe-to-toe with adversaries on the front lines, 24/7/365.

In order to take action against an adversary, it is critical to understand the full nature of the threat. In just minutes, OverWatch analysts reconstruct threat activity, transforming it from a collection of data points into a clear story. This information empowers organizations to not only remediate but also plug the gaps in their environment.

Time is of the essence in preventing an intrusion from becoming a breach. OverWatch operates as a native component of the Falcon platform. Through Falcon, OverWatch delivers clear, accurate and actionable information on potentially malicious activity in near real time, enabling organizations to respond quickly and decisively, without friction.

With each new threat, OverWatch extracts new insights to drive continuous advancements in automated detections and human threat hunting. The team is consistently fine-tuning its skills and processes to always stay a step ahead of the adversary.

## Intrusion Campaigns Summary
### Intrusion Campaign Numbers
Over the past year, OverWatch tracked steadily increasing numbers of interactive intrusion campaigns. Year over year, OverWatch observed a near 60% increase in the number of campaigns. In the most recent quarter, from April to June 2021, OverWatch uncovered more intrusion campaigns than in any other quarter.

### Adversary Motives
For yet another year, financially motivated eCrime activity dominated the interactive intrusion attempts tracked by OverWatch. ECrime accounted for 75% of the interactive intrusion activity, while targeted intrusions accounted for 24% and the remaining 1% was attributed to hacktivist activity.

**eCrime** Financially motivated criminal intrusion activity
**Targeted** State-sponsored intrusion activity that includes cyber espionage, state-nexus destruction attacks and currency generation to support a regime
**Hacktivist** Intrusion activity undertaken to gain momentum, visibility or publicity for a cause or ideology

These figures track closely with the distribution of activity seen in the previous year. Seeing these figures stabilize indicates that the distribution of eCrime and targeted intrusion activity may be reaching an equilibrium after several years of eCrime activity rapidly expanding relative to targeted intrusions.

Year over year, OverWatch observed a near 60% increase in the number of interactive intrusion campaigns.

### INTRUSION CAMPAIGNS BY THREAT TYPE
#### July 2019 to June 2020 vs. July 2020 to June 2021
*Figure 1. Relative distribution of targeted intrusion, eCrime and hacktivist activity uncovered by OverWatch*

*   **2020:** Hacktivist 1%, Targeted Intrusion 23%, eCrime 76%
*   **2021:** Hacktivist 1%, Targeted Intrusion 24%, eCrime 75%

**eCrime**
There are signs that eCrime adversaries may be becoming more capable, particularly if measured by the speed at which they can move through a victim environment. OverWatch measures breakout time — the time an adversary takes to move laterally, from an initially compromised host to another host within the victim environment. Of the hands-on eCrime intrusion activity from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 where breakout time could be derived, the average was just 1 hour 32 minutes. Moreover, the OverWatch team found that in 36% of those intrusions, the adversary was able to move laterally to additional hosts in less than 30 minutes.

ECrime adversaries also continue to innovate and evolve their business models to increase their chance of success. The majority of ransomware operators engaged in big game hunting (BGH) activity have now adopted the threat of data leaks alongside data encryption as a means to extract payment from victims. Many adversaries have also established dedicated leak sites (DLSs) as a forum to publicize victim details and release the stolen data. INDRIK SPIDER is an exception to this trend toward the use of data extortion.

Another feature of the eCrime threat landscape in the past 12 months is the growing importance of access brokers who play a role in facilitating access for other eCrime actors to stage their intrusions. The feature story *In Pursuit of PROPHET* in this report takes a look at access brokers in action.

**eCRIME BREAKOUT TIME**
Initial Access -> Lateral Movement
**1 HOUR 32 MINUTES**

OverWatch also recorded a 100% increase in instances of cryptojacking in interactive intrusions year over year. This was likely driven by steep increases in cryptocurrency values beginning in late 2020.

The potential for growth in eCrime activity is almost limitless, propelled by new actors, new vulnerabilities or failures on the part of organizations to maintain basic security hygiene. While OverWatch indeed saw an increase in the number of eCrime intrusion attempts over the past 12 months, this growth did not outpace the growth in targeted intrusion activity to the degree seen in previous years.

One factor that may have stemmed the rapid acceleration of eCrime activity is successful interventions by law enforcement against adversary-controlled infrastructure and resources. These efforts touched the operations of several prominent eCrime groups including WIZARD SPIDER, MUMMY SPIDER, CIRCUS SPIDER, GRACEFUL SPIDER, TWISTED SPIDER and CARBON SPIDER. Law enforcement activity, however, appears to only temporarily disrupt eCrime activity, rather than halting operations altogether. Adversaries have shown resilience by quickly activating new C2 infrastructure and diversifying their toolsets.

**Targeted Intrusion**
Generally, adversary groups from the People’s Republic of China, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, aka North Korea) and the Islamic Republic of Iran are the source of the majority of targeted intrusion[5] activity OverWatch tracks. However, in the past year, OverWatch also tracked an uptick in suspected state-nexus activity not attributed to named actor groups.

[5] Again, the term “targeted intrusion” in this report refers to state-nexus or other advanced persistent threat actors.

*Figure 2. Proportion of targeted intrusion activity conducted by different targeted adversary groups, July 2020 to June 2021*

*   PANDAs (China) 67%
*   SUSPECTED STATE-SPONSORED (Not Attributed) 20%
*   KITTENs (Iran) 7%
*   CHOLLIMAs (North Korea) 5%
*   BEARs (Russia) 1%
*   BUFFALOs (Vietnam) 1%

In the year leading up to June 30, 2021, Chinese state-nexus adversaries (aka PANDAs) maintained a high operational tempo and conducted sustained and wide-ranging campaigns motivated both by intellectual property (IP) theft and intelligence gathering objectives. PANDAs were among the targeted intrusion adversaries most commonly uncovered by OverWatch threat hunters during this period.

A notable development in early 2021 was the mass exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities by suspected China-nexus adversaries. This serves as a reminder of the diverse skill sets of China-nexus actors and highlights the ever-present threat of new vulnerabilities being found and exploited. A story later in this report — *OverWatch Disrupts Microsoft Exchange Zero-Day Exploits with Falcon Complete* — examines how CrowdStrike’s managed services worked together to disrupt and expel an as-yet-unnamed threat.

OverWatch tracked relatively consistent levels of activity attributed to North Korea (CHOLLIMAs). CrowdStrike Intelligence reports that North Korean actors — including two actors tracked by OverWatch in the past 12 months, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA and SILENT CHOLLIMA — continue to make iterative updates and improvements to their toolsets. An intrusion story later in this report — *Custom Tooling Rings Alarm Bells in Intrusion by (Not So) SILENT CHOLLIMA* — sheds light on how some of this custom tooling has been used in the wild.

In contrast to the observed China-nexus and DPRK adversary activity, OverWatch saw a downturn in activity stemming from Iran (KITTENs). CrowdStrike Intelligence reports that in 2020, many of Iran’s observed intrusion efforts focused on targets related to narrower geopolitical and domestic concerns; this may have contributed to the reduction in campaigns seen by OverWatch.

OverWatch also uncovered a number of intrusion campaigns with all of the hallmarks of state-nexus activity, but that cannot at this time be attributed to any of the named adversary groups tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence. Much of this activity targeted the telecommunications industry, explored in detail in the *Signal Interference* feature later in this report. This increase in activity attributable to diverse and globally dispersed mission clusters underscores the variety of targeted intrusion threats that exist in the current threat landscape.

**Hacktivism**
Hacktivism accounted for only a small fraction of the interactive activity tracked by OverWatch. All hacktivist activity seen by OverWatch has been attributed to a single adversary group — FRONTLINE JACKAL, an Iranian nationalist hacktivist group known to deface websites and carry out other disruptive online activity targeting U.S., Israeli and Saudi Arabian organizations. Adversary activity observed by OverWatch provided CrowdStrike Intelligence with additional visibility into this group’s operating procedures.

### Intrusions by Industry Vertical
Figure 3 shows the top 10 industry verticals that featured most frequently in the interactive intrusion activity uncovered by OverWatch from July 2020 to June 2021. The same 10 industries also made up the top 10 list for the 12-month period from July 2019 to June 2020. Notably, the technology industry has now held the top spot for the past three years.

*Figure 3. The figure shows which industry verticals were most frequently impacted by interactive intrusions and also shows any changes relative to the period from July 2019 to June 2020*

**TOP 10 VERTICALS BY INTRUSION FREQUENCY**
#### July 2020 to June 2021
*   Technology
*   Telecommunications
*   Manufacturing
*   Financial
*   Professional Services
*   Academic
*   Healthcare
*   Retail
*   Government
*   Engineering

While Figure 3 shows the prevalence of intrusion activity against particular industries within the OverWatch data, it does not illustrate the significant overall growth in the number of intrusions. As noted at the start of this report, total intrusion activity observed by OverWatch increased by approximately 60% year over year — and the growth in intrusion activity within several of the industries in this top 10 list exceeded that rate of increase.

A year-over-year comparison of the total number of intrusion attempts that OverWatch observed finds that intrusions targeting the telecommunications and retail industries more than doubled. The professional services industry saw a more than 90% increase in interactive intrusion numbers, while the government and academic sectors both saw intrusion numbers increase by more than 80%.

The ranking of the top industries changes when the data is broken out by threat type, specifically targeted intrusion vs. eCrime activity. Figure 4 shows the top five industries most frequently impacted by interactive intrusions carried out by targeted intrusion and eCrime adversaries respectively.

*Figure 4. Comparison of the industry verticals most frequently impacted by targeted intrusion vs. eCrime threat actors. July 2020 to June 2021*

**TOP 5 VERTICALS BY INTRUSION FREQUENCY**
**Targeted Intrusion vs. eCrime Activity**
#### July 2020 to June 2021

**Targeted Intrusions**
*   Telecommunications
*   Healthcare
*   Government
*   Academic
*   Technology

**eCrime**
*   Technology
*   Manufacturing
*   Professional Services
*   Financial
*   Retail

The telecommunications industry notably accounted for 40% of all targeted intrusion activity uncovered by OverWatch in the 12 months to June 30, 2021, explored in detail in the *Signal Interference* feature later in this report. Other notable inclusions in the targeted intrusion “Top 5” are the healthcare and academic industries, which fell victim to ongoing targeting over the reporting period, particularly due to their involvement in COVID-19 related research.[6]

ECrime intrusions, in contrast, were more evenly distributed across industry verticals. This is indicative of the opportunistic nature of much of eCrime activity, which leads to a much wider spread of activity across diverse industry verticals.

[6] To read more about targeting of COVID-19 research, see the 2021 CrowdStrike Global Threat Report, and the CrowdStrike blog *Don’t Get Schooled: Understanding the Threats to the Academic Industry*.

### Adversary Activity
In the year to June 30, 2021, OverWatch uncovered interactive intrusion activity conducted by 30 distinct named threat actor groups. In addition, threat hunters uncovered an extensive array of activity suspected of being eCrime or targeted intrusion activity, but not specifically tied to a named group.

Figure 5 provides a breakdown of the adversaries observed by OverWatch. ECrime activity was by far the most widespread across industry verticals, followed by intrusions conducted by PANDA adversaries.

OverWatch uncovered activity by 13 named eCrime (aka SPIDER) adversary groups. Of these groups, WIZARD SPIDER[7] was the most prolific, with nearly twice as many intrusion attempts than any other eCrime group observed by OverWatch. WIZARD SPIDER deployed the Cobalt Strike Beacon in more than half of these intrusions; other commonly seen tools included Ryuk ransomware, the Windows backdoor access tool BazarLoader and the Active Directory discovery tool AdFind.

For targeted intrusion activity, intrusions attributed to People’s Republic of China (aka PANDA) actors were the most common. OverWatch uncovered intrusion attempts by eight separate named China-nexus adversaries, with WICKED PANDA[8] being the most active. WICKED PANDA also frequently deployed Cobalt Strike using bespoke loaders such as AttachLoader while also deploying the custom Winnti, ShadowPad and RouterGod backdoors.

A few things to note about the data presented in Figure 5:

*   The heat mapping represents the number of distinct actors active within a particular vertical.
*   The heat mapping does not represent the total number of intrusion attempts within a vertical, as multiple intrusions by the same adversary group are only represented once.
*   Attribution to a high degree of confidence is not always possible. This table does not reflect any unattributed activity that occurred in any of the industry verticals.
*   Verticals not listed in this chart indicate that OverWatch did not record any intrusions attributable to a specific actor group during this period.

## Adversary Technique and Tooling Insights
OverWatch is a sophisticated threat hunting team that finds and disrupts adversary activity on a global scale. OverWatch carefully documents the details of each intrusion it uncovers, building a rich data set of adversary activity. With each new intrusion, threat hunters create a sharper picture of the threat landscape and the tradecraft of the adversaries that inhabit it.

This data-driven analysis of adversary tradecraft seeks to better equip defenders to take a proactive and evidence-informed approach to protecting their environment. The analysis below draws on OverWatch’s rich repository of intrusion data collected over the past year. It begins with a visualization of interactive intrusion activity observed by OverWatch threat hunters in a MITRE ATT&CK® heat map. It then details the techniques and tools encountered most often by OverWatch, thereby indicating where defenders can potentially achieve the greatest return on hunting efforts. It goes on to examine outliers in the data, highlighting the more novel and sophisticated techniques OverWatch uncovered.

### MITRE ATT&CK Heat Map
OverWatch tracks interactive intrusion activity against the MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix. The following heat map illustrates the prevalence of adversary tactics, techniques and sub-techniques observed by OverWatch threat hunters from Jan. 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021.[9] This heat map represents activity seen in interactive intrusions only, and does not reflect the breadth of activity seen and stopped by the Falcon platform. This table excludes any techniques or sub-techniques not observed by OverWatch in this reporting period.

[9] While the rest of this report covers a 12-month period, the heat map only includes data from Jan. 1, 2021, when OverWatch began tracking against the latest MITRE ATT&CK matrix, which, among other changes, introduced sub-techniques.

*Figure 6. MITRE ATT&CK heat map showing the techniques and sub-techniques observed by OverWatch in interactive intrusion attempts from Jan. 1 to June 30, 2021*
*This is a visual heat map, and cannot be accurately represented in markdown. The image shows a series of tables with the following columns: Technique, Sub-technique. The tables are color-coded to represent the prevalence of each technique. The tables are organized by MITRE ATT&CK tactic, and include the following tactics: Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Command and Control, Exfiltration, Impact.*

### Techniques and Tools: A Closer Look
There are no surprises among the most commonly observed techniques. In fact, the heat map in Figure 6 clearly illustrates that tried-and-true techniques serve as the foundation for a significant proportion of the malicious interactive activity OverWatch observes. The heat map thus serves as a guide to defenders, highlighting which focus areas they should prioritize for the best return on their investment of time and resources.

As an example, building up hunting capabilities across discovery techniques can yield significant dividends. As a threat actor establishes a foothold, they commonly begin the discovery process to better understand the victim organization’s domain, user accounts and system configurations. This is usually true regardless of the threat actor’s ultimate intent. Discovery is a vital step to plan their next move, be it lateral movement, collection or exfiltration.

Because many discovery activities fall well within what is “normal” administrative behavior in an enterprise environment, it is crucial that any hunting leads are augmented by tooling and human expertise that will filter out likely false positives. Hunters should prioritize the results from their hunting leads by focusing on instances where multiple different discovery hunting leads trigger within a short period of time. A sudden “burst” of discovery actions may stand in contrast to administrators or normal users, and often reflects an adversary quickly trying to orient themselves in a network.

Ingress Tool Transfer is another of the techniques most commonly observed by OverWatch. It is therefore beneficial for defenders and hunters to know which tools are most often used by threat actors. Table 1 shows the list of tools common across both targeted intrusion and eCrime actors, as well as the top tools used exclusively by each group.

*Table 1. Tools commonly used by targeted intrusion and eCrime adversaries, July 2020 to June 2021*

| Top 5 Tools Common to Targeted Intrusion Activity and eCrime Intrusions | Unique to eCrime Intrusions | Unique to Targeted Intrusion Activity |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Mimikatz | 1. NS.exe (and name variants) | 1. nmap |
| 2. Cobalt Strike Beacon | 2. GMER | 2. dirtycow |
| 3. PsExec | 3. Process Hacker | 3. Tiny Shell (tshd) |
| 4. ProcDump | 4. Defender Control | 4. OpenSSH |
| 5. Advanced IP Scanner | 5. Dharma | 5. Fatedier |

### Top Unique Techniques: Targeted Intrusions and eCrime
In addition to looking at the most common techniques in aggregate, it is interesting to consider the top techniques unique to each threat type. Here the data supports OverWatch's expectations around adversary motivations and tradecraft.

| Targeted Intrusions | eCrime |
|---|---|
| **T1070.006** Defense Evasion Indicator Removal on Host: Timestomp | **T1496** Impact Resource Hijacking |
| **T1574** Persistence Privilege Escalation Defense Evasion Hijack Execution Flow | **T1055.001** Privilege Escalation Defense Evasion Process Injection: Dynamic-link Library Injection |
| **T1048** Exfiltration Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol | **T1110.001** Credential Access Brute Force: Password Guessing |
| **T1056** Collection Credential Access Input Capture | **T1189** Initial Access Drive-by Compromise |
| **T1070.003** Defense Evasion Indicator Removal on Host: Clear Command History | **T1484** Privilege Escalation Defense Evasion Domain Policy Modification |

Targeted intrusion actors leverage techniques that are inherently more stealthy and focused on long-term access, such as Indicator Removal on Host and Clear Command History. Further, use of Input Capture and Exfiltration over Alternative Protocol is illustrative of intelligence gathering objectives.

On the other hand, eCrime actors are opportunistic in their targeting, as evidenced by Brute Force and Drive-by Compromise techniques. Financial motivations also come through clearly, as a rise in cryptojacking operations in recent months has placed Resource Hijacking firmly in this list.

### Expect the Unexpected: Five Uncommon Techniques That Underscore the Need for Comprehensive Hunting Capabilities
The analysis to this point has examined the techniques that are most prominent in the OverWatch data. Threat hunting really comes into its own, however, when defending against the less-prevalent techniques that adversaries employ as part of their operations.

The analysis that follows examines some of the rare and notable techniques that OverWatch threat hunters uncovered among the activity observed over the past year.

#### Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Ticket[10]
**T1550.003**
Once an attacker has gained access to a domain controller, they can dump the SID and NTLM hash of a domain user with ticket granting privileges to create their own Kerberos tickets for valid use across the domain.

**What OverWatch Observed**
A persistent threat actor used Mimikatz to create a Golden Ticket using harvested credentials from the domain controller and immediately injected the newly created ticket into their session for use. Mimikatz continues to show up in many of the intrusion attempts OverWatch identifies, as its versatility for both dumping and leveraging credentials makes it a straightforward and effective tool for adversaries to employ.

```
kerberos::golden /domain:[REDACTED] /sid:[REDACTED] /rc4:[REDACTED] /user:krb /ptt
```

For this attack to be successful, a threat actor must have already gained privileged access to a domain controller on the network. Using this technique allows them to create tickets for nonexistent accounts, thereby obfuscating their access and potentially maintaining a foothold in the network.

[10] https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003/

#### Hijack Execution Flow: COR_PROFILER[11]
**T1574.012**
Threat actors can modify the COR_PROFILER environment variable to load a malicious DLL into a .NET process that relies on the Common Language Runtime.

**What OverWatch Observed**
A suspected eCrime adversary exploited a web service on a Windows server and downloaded a number of tools. They then used WMIC to create and modify the COR_PROFILER and COR_ENABLE_PROFILING environment variables to load one of the downloaded malicious DLLs.

```
wmic  ENVIRONMENT create name="COR_ENABLE_PROFILING",username="[REDACTED]",VariableValue="1"
wmic  ENVIRONMENT create  name="COR_PROFILER",username="[REDACTED]",VariableValue="[REDACTED]”

This technique not only provides persistence, but if the .NET process that triggers it runs at a higher privilege, the attacker DLL will run at that privilege. Whether an attacker gained access to a system with valid account credentials or via an exploited service, this technique may provide privilege escalation without requiring further credential harvesting.

#### Compromise Client Software Binary[12]
**T1554**
Upon gaining access to a network, adversaries can modify client software binaries for persistence. Client software that can be compromised and used for this purpose include SSH, FTP, email clients and web browsers.

**What OverWatch Observed**
A suspected state-nexus adversary had compromised an environment prior to the victim deploying Falcon. Once OverWatch established visibility, it became clear that the adversary was well entrenched. Threat hunters observed the adversary accessing a Linux host via SSH using valid credentials. The adversary then used a renamed tcsh Unix shell with the setuid bit set to elevate privileges and installed an alternative SSH server/client, which was a modified version of SSH. The software had been altered to provide the capability of covertly logging credentials.

While it is more common for adversaries to use existing tools or native utilities to achieve their objectives, in some cases modified software may prove to be the best way for an adversary to achieve their goal. It is important for defenders to monitor software to ensure that signatures remain valid. It is also important to be alert to unusual behavior stemming from client applications.

#### Cloud Service Discovery[13]
**T1526**
After gaining initial access to a network, an adversary may attempt to perform reconnaissance on cloud services running on a host or enabled in the environment. This can take several of different forms due to the range of services across various cloud providers.
