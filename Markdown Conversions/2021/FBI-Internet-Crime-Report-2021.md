2021 INTERNET CRIME REPORT

# INTRODUCTION
Dear Reader,
In 2021, America experienced an unprecedented increase in cyber attacks and malicious cyber activity. These cyber
attacks compromised businesses in an extensive array of business sectors as well as the American public. As the cyber
threat evolves and becomes increasingly intertwined with traditional foreign intelligence threats and emerging
technologies, the FBI continues to leverage our unique authorities and partnerships to impose risks and consequences
on our nation’s cyber adversaries.
The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) provides the American public with a direct outlet to report cyber
crimes to the FBI. We analyze and investigate the reporting to track the trends and threats from cyber criminals and
then share this data with our intelligence and law enforcement partners. The FBI, alongside our partners, recognizes
how crucial information sharing of cyber activities is to prepare our partners to combat the cyber threat, through a
whole-of-government approach. Critical to that approach is public reporting to IC3 - enabling us to fill in the missing
pieces with this valuable information during the investigatory process. Not only does this reporting help to prevent
additional crimes, it allows us to develop key insights on the ever-evolving trends and threats we face from malign
cyber actors.
In 2021, IC3 continued to receive a record number of complaints from the American public: 847,376 reported
complaints, which was a 7% increase from 2020, with potential losses exceeding $6.9 billion. Among the 2021
complaints received, ransomware, business e-mail compromise (BEC) schemes, and the criminal use of
cryptocurrency are among the top incidents reported. In 2021, BEC schemes resulted in 19,954 complaints with an
adjusted loss of nearly $2.4 billion.
IC3’s commitment to cyber victims and partnerships allow for the continued success through programs such as the
IC3’s Recovery Asset Team (RAT). Established in 2018, RAT streamlines communications with financial institutions and
FBI field offices to assist freezing of funds for victims. In 2021, the IC3’s RAT initiated the Financial Fraud Kill Chain
(FFKC) on 1,726 BEC complaints involving domestic to domestic transactions with potential losses of $443,448,237. A
monetary hold was placed on approximately $329 million, which represents a 74% success rate.
In 2021, heightened attention was brought to the urgent need for more cyber incident reporting to the federal
government. Cyber incidents are in fact crimes deserving of an investigation, leading to judicial repercussions for the
perpetrators who commit them. Thank you to all those readers who reported crimes to IC3 throughout the year.
Without this reporting, we could not be as effective in ensuring consequences are imposed on those perpetrating
these attacks and our understanding of these threats would not be as robust. Please visit IC3.gov to access the latest
information on criminal internet activity.
The FBI’s Cyber Division is working harder than ever to protect the American public and to instill safety, security, and
confidence in a digitally connected world. We encourage everyone to use IC3 and reach out to their local FBI field
office to report malicious activity. Together we can continue to create a safer and more secure cyber landscape.

# THE IC3
Today’s FBI is an intelligence-driven and threat focused national security organization with both intelligence
and law enforcement responsibilities. We are focused on protecting the American people from terrorism,
espionage, cyber attacks and major criminal threats, and on supporting our many partners with
information, services, support, training, and leadership. The IC3 serves those needs as a mechanism to
gather intelligence on cyber and internet crime so we can stay ahead of the threat.

The IC3 was established in May 2000 to receive complaints of internet related crime and has received more
than 6.5 million complaints since its inception. Its mission is to provide the public with a reliable and
convenient reporting mechanism to submit information to the FBI concerning suspected cyber enabled
criminal activity, and to develop effective alliances with law enforcement and industry partners to help
those who report. Information is analyzed and disseminated for investigative and intelligence purposes for
law enforcement and for public awareness.

To promote public awareness, the IC3 aggregates the submitted data and produces an annual report to
educate on the trends impacting the public. The quality of the data is directly attributable to the
information ingested via the public interface, www.ic3.gov, and the data categorized based on the
information provided in the individual complaints. The IC3 staff analyzes the data to identify trends in cyber
crimes and how those trends may impact the public in the coming year.

# THREAT OVERVIEWS FOR 2021
## Business Email Compromise (BEC)
In 2021, the IC3 received 19,954 Business Email Compromise (BEC)/ Email Account
Compromise (EAC) complaints with adjusted losses at nearly $2.4 billion. BEC/EAC is a
sophisticated scam targeting both businesses and individuals performing transfers of
funds. The scam is frequently carried out when a subject compromises legitimate business
email accounts through social engineering or computer intrusion techniques to conduct
unauthorized transfers of funds.
As fraudsters have become more sophisticated and preventative measures have been put in place, the
BEC/EAC scheme has continually evolved in kind. The scheme has evolved from simple hacking or spoofing
of business and personal email accounts and a request to send wire payments to fraudulent bank accounts.
These schemes historically involved compromised vendor emails, requests for W-2 information, targeting
of the real estate sector, and fraudulent requests for large amounts of gift cards. Now, fraudsters are using
virtual meeting platforms to hack emails and spoof business leaders’ credentials to initiate the fraudulent
wire transfers. These fraudulent wire transfers are often immediately transferred to cryptocurrency wallets
and quickly dispersed, making recovery efforts more difficult.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions on in-person meetings led to increases in telework or virtual
communication practices. These work and communication practices continued into 2021, and the IC3 has
observed an emergence of newer BEC/EAC schemes that exploit this reliance on virtual meetings to instruct
victims to send fraudulent wire transfers. They do so by compromising an employer or financial director’s
email, such as a CEO or CFO, which would then be used to request employees to participate in virtual
meeting platforms. In those meetings, the fraudster would insert a still picture of the CEO with no audio,
or a “deep fake” audio through which fraudsters, acting as business executives, would then claim their
audio/video was not working properly. The fraudsters would then use the virtual meeting platforms to
directly instruct employees to initiate wire transfers or use the executives’ compromised email to provide
wiring instructions.

## IC3 RECOVERY ASSET TEAM
The Internet Crime Complaint Center’s Recovery Asset Team (RAT) was established in February 2018 to
streamline communication with financial institutions and assist FBI field offices with the freezing of funds
for victims who made transfers to domestic accounts under fraudulent pretenses.
RAT Process[^5]

[^5]: Accessibility description: Image shows the different stages of a complaint in the RAT process.
* If criteria is met, transaction details are forwarded to the identified point of contact at the recipient
bank to notify of fraudulent activity and request freezing of the account. Once response is received
from the recipient bank, RAT contacts the appropriate FBI field office(s).

![Image shows the different stages of a complaint in the RAT process. * If criteria is met, transaction details are forwarded to the identified point of contact at the recipient bank to notify of fraudulent activity and request freezing of the account.

The RAT functions as a liaison between law enforcement and financial institutions supporting statistical and
investigative analysis.

Goals of RAT-Financial Institution Partnership

- Assist in the identification of potentially fraudulent accounts across the sector.
- Remain at the forefront of emerging trends among financial fraud schemes.
- Foster a symbiotic relationship in which information is appropriately shared.

Guidance for BEC Victims

- Contact the originating financial institution as soon as fraud is recognized to request a recall or
reversal and a Hold Harmless Letter or Letter of Indemnity.
- File a detailed complaint with www.ic3.gov. It is vital the complaint contain all required data in
provided fields, including banking information.
- Visit www.ic3.gov for updated PSAs regarding BEC trends as well as other fraud schemes targeting
specific populations, like trends targeting real estate, pre-paid cards, and W-2s, for example.
- Never make any payment changes without verifying the change with the intended recipient; verify
email addresses are accurate when checking email on a cell phone or other mobile device

The IC3 RAT has proven to be a valuable resource for field offices and victims. The following are three
examples of the RAT’s successful contributions to investigative and recovery efforts:

Philadelphia
In December 2021, the IC3 received a complaint filed by a victim roadway commission regarding a wire
transfer of more than $1.5 million to a fraudulent U.S. domestic bank account. The IC3 RAT quickly notified
the recipient financial institution of the fraudulent account by initiating the financial fraud kill chain.
Collaboration between the IC3 RAT, the recipient financial institution, and the Philadelphia Field office
resulted in learning the subject quickly depleted the wired funds from the original account into two
separate accounts held at the same institution. The financial institution was able to quickly identify the
second-hop accounts and freeze the funds, making a full recovery possible.

Memphis
In June 2021, the IC3 received a complaint filed by a victim law office regarding a wire transfer of more
than $198k to a fraudulent U.S. domestic account. IC3 RAT collaboration with the Memphis Field Office and
the recipient financial institution resulted in learning the domestic account was a correspondent account
for a fraudulent account in Nigeria. IC3 RAT immediately initiated the international FFKC to FinCEN and
LEGAT Abuja, which resulted in freezing the full wired amount. The victim forwarded a note of gratitude
for all the work put into their case.

Albany
In October 2021, the IC3 received a complaint filed by a victim of a tech support scam where an
unauthorized wire transfer of $53k was sent from their account to a U.S. domestic custodial account held
by a cryptocurrency exchange (CE). The IC3 RAT immediately notified the recipient financial institution and
collaborated with the CE that held the account. With the knowledge that funds sent to cryptocurrency
accounts will be depleted to crypto faster than the usual wire transfer gets depleted, the immediate efforts
of initiating the financial fraud kill chain with the CE resulted in the freezing of the funds in the custodial
account before they could be depleted to purchase or withdraw cryptocurrency. Further collaboration with
the domestic financial institution and the Albany Field Office confirmed the funds were frozen in the
account, making a full recovery possible.

Confidence Fraud/Romance scams encompass those designed to pull on a
victim’s “heartstrings.” In 2021, the IC3 received reports from 24,299 victims
who experienced more than $956 million in losses to Confidence
Fraud/Romance scams. This type of fraud accounts for the third highest losses
reported by victims.
Romance scams occur when a criminal adopts a
fake online identity to gain a victim’s affection
and confidence. The scammer uses the illusion of
a romantic or close relationship to manipulate
and/or steal from the victim. The criminals who
carry out Romance scams are experts at what
they do and will seem genuine, caring, and
believable. The scammer’s intention is to quickly
establish a relationship, endear himself/herself
to the victim, gain trust, and eventually ask for
money. Scammers may propose marriage and make plans to meet in person, but that will never happen.
Scam artists often say they are in the military, or a trades-based industry engaged in projects outside the
U.S. That makes it easier to avoid meeting in person—and more plausible when they request money be
sent overseas for a medical emergency or unexpected legal fee. Grandparent Scams also fall into this
category, where criminals impersonate a panicked loved one, usually a grandchild, nephew, or niece of an
elderly person. The loved one claims to be in trouble and needs money immediately.
Con artists are present on most dating and social media sites. In 2021, the IC3 received thousands of
complaints from victims of online relationships resulting in sextortion or investment scams.
- Sextortion occurs when someone threatens to distribute your private and sensitive material if their
demands are not met. In 2021, the IC3 received more than 18,000 sextortion-related complaints,
with losses over $13.6 million. Please see the September 2021 IC3 PSA on Sextortion for more
information.[^8]
- Many victims of Romance scams also report being pressured into investment opportunities,
especially using cryptocurrency. In 2021, the IC3 received more than 4,325 complaints, with losses
over $429 million, from Confidence Fraud/Romance scam victims who also reported the use of
investments and cryptocurrencies, or “pig butchering” –so named because victims’ investment
accounts are fattened up before draining, much a like a pig before slaughter. Additional
information on “pig butchering” can be found in the September 2021 IC3 PSA I-091621-PSA.[^9]

2021 INTERNET CRIME REPORT

## Cryptocurrency (Virtual Currency)
In 2021, the IC3 received 34,202 complaints involving the use of some type of
cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or Ripple. While that number
showed a decrease from 2020’s victim count (35,229), the loss amount reported in IC3
complaints increased nearly seven-fold, from 2020’s reported amount of $246,212,432,
to total reported losses in 2021 of more than $1.6 billion.
Initially worth only fractions of pennies on the dollar, several cryptocurrencies have seen their values
increase substantially, sometimes exponentially. Once limited to hackers, ransomware groups, and other
denizens of the “dark web,” cryptocurrency is becoming the preferred payment method for all types of
scams – SIM swaps, tech support fraud, employment schemes, romance scams, even some auction fraud.
It is extremely pervasive in investment scams, where losses can reach into the hundreds of thousands of
dollars per victim. The IC3 has noted the following scams particularly using cryptocurrencies.
- Cryptocurrency ATMs: Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) used to purchase cryptocurrency are
popping up everywhere. Regulations on the machines are lax and purchases are almost
instantaneous and irreversible, making this payment method lucrative to criminals. In 2021, the
IC3 received more than 1,500 reports of scams using crypto ATMs, with losses of approximately
$28 million. The most common scams reported were Confidence Fraud/Romance, Investment,
Employment, and Government Impersonation. Read more about crypto ATM scams in IC3 PSA I-
110421-PSA.[^10]
- Cryptocurrency support impersonators: Increasingly, crypto owners are falling victim to scammers
impersonating support or security from cryptocurrency exchanges. Owners are alerted of an issue
with their crypto wallet and are convinced to either give access to their crypto wallet or transfer
the contents of their wallet to another wallet to “safeguard” the contents. Crypto owners are also
searching online for support with their cryptocurrencies. Owners contact fake support numbers
located online and are convinced to give up login information or control of their crypto accounts.
- Many victims of Romance scams also report being pressured into investment opportunities,
especially using cryptocurrency. In 2021, the IC3 received more than 4,325 complaints, with losses
over $429 million, from Confidence Fraud/Romance scam victims who also reported the use of
investments and cryptocurrencies, or “pig butchering.” The scammer's initial contact is typically
made via dating apps and other social media sites. The scammer gains the confidence and trust of
the victim, and then claims to have knowledge of cryptocurrency investment or trading
opportunities that will result in substantial profits.

## Ransomware
![Image shows actions you can Take to Protect Against Ransomware: Update your operating system. Implement user training and phishing exercises to raise awareness, secure and monitor Remote Desktop Protocol (DDP) if used, and make an offline backup of our data.]

[^11]: Accessibility description: Image shows actions you can Take to Protect Against Ransomware: Update your operating system. Implement user training and phishing exercises to raise awareness, secure and monitor Remote Desktop Protocol (DDP) if used, and make an offline backup of our data.

Immediate Actions You Can Take Now to
Protect Against Ransomware:
- Update your operating system and software.
- Implement user training and phishing exercises to raise awareness
about the risks of suspicious links and attachments.
- If you use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), secure and monitor it.
- Make an offline backup of your data.
- Use multifactor authentication (MFA).

In 2021, the IC3 received 3,729 complaints identified as ransomware with adjusted losses
of more than $49.2 million. Ransomware is a type of malicious software, or malware, that
encrypts data on a computer, making it unusable. A malicious cyber criminal holds the data
hostage until the ransom is paid. If the ransom is not paid, the victim’s data remains
unavailable. Cyber criminals may also pressure victims to pay the ransom by threatening to
destroy the victim’s data or to release it to the public.
Ransomware tactics and techniques continued to evolve in 2021, which demonstrates ransomware threat
actors’ growing technological sophistication and an increased ransomware threat to organizations globally.
Although cyber criminals use a variety of techniques to infect victims with ransomware, phishing emails,
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) exploitation, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities remained the top
three initial infection vectors for ransomware incidents reported to the IC3. Once a ransomware threat
actor has gained code execution on a device or network access, they can deploy ransomware. Note: these
infection vectors likely remain popular because of the increased use of remote work and schooling starting
in 2020 and continuing through 2021. This increase expanded the remote attack surface and left network
defenders struggling to keep pace with routine software patching.[^12]

Ransomware and Critical Infrastructure Sectors

In June 2021, the IC3 began tracking reported ransomware incidents in which the victim was a member of
a critical infrastructure sector. There are 16 critical infrastructure sectors whose assets, systems, and
networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital to the United States that their incapacitation
or destruction would have a debilitating effect on our security, national economy, public health or safety,
or any combination thereof.

2021 INTERNET CRIME REPORT
15
In October 2021, the IC3 posted a Joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to ic3.gov regarding ongoing cyber
threats to U.S. Water and Wastewater Systems. In September 2021, the IC3 posted a Private Industry
Notification (PIN) which warned that ransomware attacks targeting the Food and Agriculture sector disrupt
operations, cause financial loss, and negatively impact the food supply chain. In May 2021, the IC3 posted
an FBI Liaison Alert System (FLASH) report that advised the FBI identified at least 16 CONTI ransomware
attacks targeting US Healthcare and First Responder networks, including law enforcement agencies,
emergency medical services, 9-1-1 dispatch centers, and municipalities within the last year. And in March
2021, the IC3 posted a FLASH warning that FBI reporting indicated an increase in PYSA ransomware
targeting education institutions in 12 US states and the United Kingdom.

The IC3 received 649 complaints that indicated organizations belonging to a critical infrastructure sector
were victims of a ransomware attack. Of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors, IC3 reporting indicated 14
sectors had at least 1 member that fell victim to a ransomware attack in 2021.[^13]
