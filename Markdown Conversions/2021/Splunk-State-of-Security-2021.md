The State of 
Security 2021

Global research uncovers IT security leaders’ 
 key strategies for cloud complexity, remote work 
and supply chain attacks.

Hindsight Is 2020: 
The Security Hits 
Keep Coming

2020 started with COVID\-19 and a pell\-mell shift to remote work, and finished 
with the gut\-punch of a major breach that put hundreds of organizations into 
frantic assess\-and\-remediate mode. The year will be seen as one of the most 
consequential in any security professional’s career. For many, there will be a 
bright line dividing how things were before the pandemic from how they are 
now, as we hope to rapidly vaccinate our way out of it. 

The consequences of the pandemic’s rapid shift to work\-from\-home — and the 
exponentially faster shift to cloud technology that it helped drive — include less 
visibility into the security ecosystem, less control of access points, and a larger, 
more varied attack surface for adversaries to target.

And the consequence of the SolarWinds hacks is a deeper fear of supply chain 
attacks, and an almost existential question about the vendors every company 
relies on: Should we trust our trusted partners?

yet the challenges of 2021 are not unfamiliar. They are, 
broadly: consistency, cost and complexity. To explore 
the top security challenges facing midmarket and 
enterprise organizations and to understand emerging 
strategies, we conducted a global survey of 535 
security leaders in nine leading economies across 
multiple industries with research firm enterprise 
Strategy group. The research was done in February 
2021, nearing the one\-year anniversary of the 
pandemic, and two months after the disclosure of 
the SolarWinds hacks.

When the security and IT decision\-makers in our 
survey identified the prime security challenges of a 
cloud\-native security world, two stood out: 50% of 
respondents cited maintaining consistency of policies 
and their enforcement across data centers and cloud, 
and 42% cited the cost and complexity of using 
multiple security controls. Overall, our respondents 
seem to be telling us that cloud complexity, driven 
by transient workloads, new software development 
models, and heterogeneous public cloud usage, 
is the next great security challenge.

78% of companies expect 

another SolarWinds\-style 
supply chain attack.

88% of orgs are increasing 
security spending — 35% say 
“increasing significantly.”

Rising cloud adoption 
is the top issue driving 
security investment.

Defining Disruption
Our respondents identified their primary challenge 
of the pandemic year as a definite increase in 
cyberattacks. more than four in five suffered 
at least one security incident, with business 
email compromise and data breaches being 
most common.

These incidents consumed significant time and 
resources for remediation (an impact cited by 
42% of respondents), and led to lost productivity 
(36%) and disruption of business systems (35%). 
Clearly, these incidents are costly, distracting and 
potentially devastating. 

In addition to the difficulties in quickly shifting to 
remote work and protecting a new, somewhat 
sprawling perimeter, security teams had to contend 
with the massive, and massively successful, 
SolarWinds hacks. Disclosed in December 2020, 
these attacks caused an extra wave of disruption, 
leading many organizations to increase their

efforts to fend off future supply chain attacks. To 
do so, survey respondents claim they will conduct 
more security controls audits (35%), scan software 
updates more frequently (30%), increase penetration 
testing (27%) and ramp up multifactor authentication 
(26%). While these actions can improve security, they 
also stretch already limited resources. 

On that point: 78% of organizations report one 
or more challenges related to the cybersecurity 
team’s capabilities or scalability, including the sheer 

volume of security alerts that redirect efforts from 
proactive improvement to tactical firefighting, 
and the drag caused by manual processes. 
And 78% also voice concern that they could be 
compromised by an attack like the SolarWinds 
hacks. given that we haven’t heard the last of the 
SolarWinds attacks, or even the beginning of other 
assaults on the supply chain that may come, we 
wonder: What were the other 22% thinking?

Cloud complexity is the next great 
security challenge.

If you want one takeaway, here it is: 
Security is a data problem. 

Data. It’s what you’re protecting, it’s what tells you when the 
bad guys come knocking (or are already inside), and it defines 
the virtual cloud infrastructures in which it lives.

2021’s challenges: 
cloud complexity and the expansion of remote work
hybrid visibility is difficult enough with one cloud service provider. That may soon seem 
like the good old days.

 ■ 75% of cloud infrastructure users are multicloud today. 

 ■ 87% expect to use multiple cloud service providers two years from now. 

 ■ 76% of respondents say that remote workers are harder to secure.

 ■ 53% say attacks have increased during the pandemic. 

 j 12% call it a significant increase.

 ■ 78% of security leaders are concerned about more SolarWinds\-style attacks in the future.

 ■ Two months after the SolarWinds hacks were disclosed, only 47% of CISOs had briefed executive leadership 

or their boards about the implications. 

 ■ Only 23% of organizations have reassessed/changed their policies toward vendor risk management.

 ■ Only 23% say they’ve segmented their networks to further limit access to systems and data. 

 ■ yes, overworked security teams have their hands full; nevertheless, the muted response to the SolarWinds 

situation is concerning.

 ■ nearly all respondents — 88% — say that their security spending will rise.

 ■ 35% say it will increase significantly. 

 ■ The takeaway: existing security processes and technologies are inadequate, 
so organizations have no choice but to increase spending and investments. 

 ■ See page 19 for respondents’ top security investment priorities.

Key recommendations (see page 25\)
 ■ Modernize the security operations center (SOC):

 ■ Continue the one good thing to come out of the pandemic: closer, timelier 

collaboration between security, IT and business professionals.

of the Data Age 

Security organizations have always been hard\-pressed to 
keep up with the rising tide of data, the ever\-expanding 
perimeter, and the increasing frequency and sophistication 
of attacks. Our research confirms the conventional wisdom: 
It’s only getting worse. 

08

ChAllengeS OF T he DATA Age

The familiar challenges have intensified in the COVID era: manual 
processes are slow, cumbersome and widespread. The eternal 
shortage of skilled security experts is more pronounced. And 
cloud migration, a trend that goes back a good decade, has 
become more challenging because of ever\-growing complexity, 
alongside ever\-increasing velocity.

Interestingly, the research found that on\-premises infrastructure 
is affected more often than cloud\-based infrastructure, but both 
are vulnerable. The differences are marginal: The most frequent 
attack, business email compromise, affected on\-premises 
applications and infrastructure 44% of the time, versus 36% 
for cloud resources. For phishing, mobile malware and insider 
attacks, the numbers vary by only a few percentage points 
at most. The key takeaway is that attacks are crossing hybrid 
infrastructures. Organizations need to prepare to defend against 
attacks regardless of where they start or end, because the 
intruder who penetrates an on\-premises entry point will attempt 
to move laterally, including into cloud\-based applications and 
data, and vice versa. 

This active extension of the chain of attack from on\-premises 
resources to the cloud underscores the need for visibility across 
environments. Security teams need to be able to connect dots. 
But since cloud is all about speed and maximum flexibility, 
developers are not eager to slow down enough to let the SOC 
implement controls. 

more than one CISO underscored that point with this specific 
example: They lamented that when their company sends people 
to Amazon Web Services’ reinvent conference, developers 
return eager to immediately implement the new features 
Amazon has rolled out for its cloud service — features the 
security organization doesn’t even know exist, much less have 
appropriate controls around.

Splunk’s CISO, yassir Abousselham, feels their pain. “In the 
race to set up remote work, there was a rushed transition 
to cloud solutions to allow remote employees to do basic 
tasks, like communicate with videoconferencing and instant 
messaging,” he says. “At many organizations, security practices 
were sacrificed.”

The new security requirements of cloud\-based technology, 
just for the work\-from\-home transition alone, are challenging, 
especially when organizations are moving at crisis speed.

“Adoption of cloud\-based applications is best secured through 
single sign\-on and multifactor authentication, because you just 
can’t effectively scale account security using passwords alone,” 
Abousselham says. “Converging to a single account per user with 
single sign\-on allows closer control of authorization, stronger 
authentication and consistent monitoring.”

Cloud complexity 
demands consistency

As public cloud usage becomes ubiquitous, security teams need 
to establish consistent controls around data and visibility into 
the complexity. ultimately, organizations need cloud\-friendly 
controls that are agnostic in terms of both architecture and 
cloud service providers.

Already, nearly nine out of 10 organizations run a substantial 
portion of their business\-critical applications in the public cloud. 
Only 15% of respondents said that they run 25% or less in the 
cloud, and 41% said they run more than half in the cloud. Further 
findings about our cloud\-first future include:

 ■ 43% of organizations have a cloud\-first policy for new 

applications. Only 14% have an on\-premises policy that 
would only consider cloud as an exception.

 ■ 75% of cloud infrastructure users are multicloud today, 

and two years from now 87% expect to use multiple cloud 
service providers. 

 ■ The percentage of organizations using three or more 

providers is expected to increase from 29% to 53% over 
the next two years.

 ■ While respondents say that 29% of their workloads are 
cloud\-native today, they expect that to nearly double, 
to 55%, in two years.

multiple trends around cloud adoption will exacerbate existing 
security challenges. Among our survey group, the top two 
identified challenges were maintaining security consistency 
across the data center and public cloud environments (cited 
by 50% of respondents) and the cost and complexity of using 
multiple cybersecurity controls (42%). Other challenges include 
a lack of visibility into public cloud infrastructure (23%), being 
excluded from development and DevOps teams who worry 
about velocity (24%), and existing security tools that don’t 
support cloud\-native environments (22%). 

When it comes to improving security visibility into cloud\-
native applications, organizations are prioritizing foundational 
capabilities like “identifying workload configurations that 
are out of compliance” (42%), “detecting malware” (33%) 
and “identifying software vulnerabilities” (33%) over more 
advanced monitoring like auditing permissions associated 
with service accounts (16%), monitoring for anomalous activity 
(15%), or watching lateral server and container workload 
communication (15%).

Hard jobs get harder

no one gets into IT security looking for a soft, low\-stakes gig. But 
our respondents uniformly agree that cloud complexities and 
the disruptions of the pandemic make their jobs even harder. 
For all its elasticity and speed, the cloud leaves security teams 
with less visibility and fewer security measures in place — 
exacerbated by 2020’s pandemic rush into the cloud, which 
shortened security review cycles. For the 49% of respondents 
who said security is a harder job than it was two years ago, the 
leading security challenges were: 

 ■ Addressing the increasingly sophisticated threat 

landscape (48%). 

 ■ Moving workloads to the cloud making it more difficult 

to monitor the attack surface (32%). 

 ■ Workforce hiring (28%).

looking at the cloud, key issues were: 

 ■ Identifying workloads that are out of compliance (42%).

 ■ Detecting malware (33%).

 ■ Identifying software vulnerabilities (33%).

The overwhelming number of alerts speaks to the challenge 
of tool sprawl, and the need for both a consolidated view of 
security data and automated event triage to reduce the 
number of alerts escalated for human intervention.

In all, the data points to a specific set of requirements for a 
security team’s success. The teams that will best manage this 
new era will be adaptive, able to learn quickly. They’ll be able 
to effectively leverage automation to improve reaction time to 
familiar threats, and free up human attention for the weird and 
urgent ones. They’ll understand their multicloud environment 
and partner well with the development and operations 
organizations that run them.

Remote work taxes the SOC

last march, many organizations made the decision, on short 
notice and often without adequate preparation, to convert the 
majority of their office operations to work\-from\-home. That 
sudden scramble required heroic efforts from both IT and 
security teams. more importantly, it required them to make 
those heroic efforts together.

The COVID\-19 pandemic made security teams more tightly 
integrated partners with business and IT leaders than ever 
before. Because it was a survival necessity. It also underscored 
for executives the value of IT security, which helps explain most 
organizations’ plans to increase security spending now. 

The most visible challenge of the pandemic was the shift to 
remote work. As this report is released, many organizations 
continue some level of pandemic\-related remote operations, 
and numerous surveys have found that most organizations 
intend to continue remote work policies that are more liberal 
than they were pre\-pandemic. Which works out well, because 
large numbers of workers report a desire to continue to work 
from home more often.

Our respondents report that their organizations are securing 
more than twice as many remote workers now as before 
COVID\-19\. The pre\-pandemic average was that 23% of workers 
were remote before the pandemic, and in early 2021, the number 
was 56%. While this is great for commute\-weary workers, it’s no 
party for the SOC: remote workers are a ripe target for bad actors, 
for reasons that include network security strategies that are 
outdated in this remote\-work environment, and more employees 
using personal devices to access work systems, where lower 
security and shared devices can lead to data leakage. 

And, indeed, most respondents report an uptick in attacks:

 ■ 76% of respondents say that remote workers are 

harder to secure.

 ■ 53% say there’s been an increase in attacks during 
the pandemic — 12% call it a significant increase.

Securing remote workers is hard, and security teams are looking 
to automate processes, adopt cloud\-based controls and more 
continuously tune detection rules. Their work to date has 
focused on basic hygiene, access and management of security 
controls. Only 20% of respondents list monitoring traffic and user 
behavior of remote employees as a significant challenge tackled 
in 2020, suggesting that more effort went, necessarily, into 
securely spinning up remote capabilities than into checking just 
how secure those capabilities ultimately were.

The greater security/IT/business collaboration during the initial 
rush to remote work has resulted in positive policy changes, 
and a stronger focus on process automation and the use of 
security analytics. This greater collaboration increases the value 
of viewing and sharing data appropriately across the entire 
organization, to the benefit of analytics initiatives. We’re seeing 
the results, which include organizations combining security 
and non\-security data to better identify cyber risks that could 
impact business. These risks can then be tracked to specific 
business processes.

Response to SolarWinds attacks

In December, apparent nation\-state hacks of a SolarWinds 
software update were revealed to have affected up to 18,000 
organizations worldwide. Two months after that, we asked our 
respondents how they had reacted to the crisis, which forced 
tens of thousands of organizations to check whether they’d been 
affected by the malware. It also should have forced everyone 
to reassess how they defend against the possibility of supply 
chain attacks.

The most surprising finding was that, despite the high level of 
concern voiced by security teams, two months later, not even 
half of CISOs had briefed their senior leadership or boards about 
the SolarWinds hacks and their own organizations’ position. 
We have to ask: What are they waiting for?

respondents did indicate that they’d undertaken a number of 
steps in the wake of the SolarWinds attacks. The top answers 
make sense: assessing security controls (35%), increasing 
security budgets (31%) and more scanning of software updates 
(30%). But given that only about a third of organizations said 
they’ve taken each of those measures, it’s not clear whether 
security leaders were responding sufficiently both to this high\-
profile compromise and the threat of similar attacks in the future.

Of course, specific responses to the SolarWinds revelation 
come on top of security practices that were already in place. 

For instance, nine out of 10 organizations reported that they 
frequently scrutinize a vendor’s security when considering a 
purchase, and at least 95% perform various assessments of a 
vendor’s security annually — with high percentages performing 
some assessments at least quarterly. 

yet these are the practices that were in place before SolarWinds 
went undetected for most of a (very crazy) year. It’s concerning 
that additional practices hadn’t gained more traction.

Last year required a lot of attention to the immediate

As we surveyed security and IT leaders in early 2021, 
we also looked at their plans to improve their security 
postures for the future.

18

FOrWArD ThInKIng

With an unbelievable year behind them, we asked our survey 
group to name their security priorities for the next two years. 
Their top answers were:

 ■ Conduct more security training for security and IT 
operations staff (cited by 25% of respondents).

 ■ Investigate or deploy cloud\-based security analytics/

operations technologies (22%).

 ■ Invest in tools to help automate and orchestrate security 

processes (22%).

 ■ Test security operations processes more often (21%).

 ■ Move security analytics/operations technologies to the 

cloud (19%).

 ■ Actively develop an integrated software architecture for 

security analytics and operations tools (18%).

 ■ Hire more security operations personnel (18%).

On the one hand, these are good priorities. Between two 
important human\-oriented skills, the priorities focus on velocity 
and insight: getting a better view into cloud applications and 
infrastructure, automating processes, and doing it all with 
analytics tools that deliver a better, more comprehensive view 
of your data and the insights therein. 

On the other hand, we’d have expected to turn up a pretty similar 
list in 2019\. For security leaders to adapt their strategies to 
2021’s realities, the new technologies deployed should include 

a zero trust strategy — because the old network\-focused idea of 
“perimeter protection” just won’t cut it. They should pay particular 
attention to the new cloud technologies hurriedly deployed to 
cope with remote workforces because of the pandemic. And tests 
of security processes should consider the new circumstances: 
more data in the cloud, and more employees — including security 
staff — working remotely. (For more, see key recommendations.)

Key technology: 
security analytics

Two invaluable uses of data are different, and sometimes 
conflated; there’s a difference between data\-driven and data\-
informed. The former means actions are based on data — perfect 
for automation. Think phishing: A malicious email is identified and 
remedial action is taken, no need to escalate to a human analyst. 
Data informed, on the other hand, means humans are making the 
decisions after receiving insights based on data. Think adjustments 
to overall security strategy in response to recent patterns of 
anomalous behavior.

Data analytics straddles both worlds, fueling automated response 
as well as giving strategic insights to analysts and security leaders. 
looking at the research, we found that analytics are the tip of 
the security spear, aimed at identifying risk and aiding decision\-
making. Specifically, analytics inform decision\-making on a range 

19

The State of Security 2021 \| SplunkFOrWArD ThInKIng

of topics, from threat detection and response to decisions about 
security controls, investments, budgeting and automation. 

Our research found not just interest in, but growing adoption 
of, two key data\-oriented technologies: security analytics and 
machine learning, which powers analytics, automation and more.

Security analytics is the combination of algorithms and analytic 
processes that detects potential threats to the enterprise. The 
demand for security analytics has grown in recent years because 
the speed, sophistication and delivery of malware and other 
attacks makes it difficult for security analysts to keep up without 
analytics tools. The research found that 82% of organizations 
say that security analytics tools play a larger role in their overall 
security decision\-making today than they did two years ago. 
This indicates a more top\-down approach to security, in which 
analytics drives choices, configurations and more.

We asked respondents why they are increasingly dependent on 
analytics tools to keep up with modern security challenges. Their 
top responses were:

 ■ To support regulatory compliance efforts (37%).

 ■ Because they’re more often incorporating 

non\-security data (36%).

 ■ Because new AI/ML\-driven tools are assisting 

with decision\-making (36%).

 ■ They have a lot more data to analyze than they 

used to (36%).

 ■ They’ve applied more security analytics in 

response to increasing threats (34%).

Further down the list, respondents noted that their analytics 
deployment corresponds to a rising use of automation and 
real\-time data (27%) and that a recent data breach prompted a 
greater reliance on analytics tools going forward (24%).

It’s worth noting that 73% of organizations said that they 
are, in fact, enriching their security analytics with other data 
sources, a merging of data and solutions that underscores what 
security leaders have known for years: All data is (or should be) 
security data.

“Analytics tools and a 
greater reliance on data 
insights help level the 
playing field for security 
analysts,” says Splunk 
CISO Yassir Abousselham. 
“They need to automate 
familiar attack responses 
to give analysts a chance 
to sort through everything 
else that may require 
their attention.”

Key technology: machine learning

Data theft happens fast, and with so much going on, it’s easy to 
miss the hackers until it’s too late. That’s why machine learning 
is big: humans can only do so much, and computers are very 
good at crunching staggering quantities of data. To support the 
need for better analytics, organizations are turning to machine 
learning (ml) technologies en masse and looking to combine and 
consolidate more than just security data to support and speed 
up decision\-making. 

Breaches can go undetected for hours. Or months. using ml 
in security analytics helps analysts speed up their discovery 
and response times, and helps them use data from across the 
organization (from assets, network performance, applications, 
etc.), not just traditional security data.

Among the research findings:

 ■ 54% of security teams currently use machine learning in 

security analytics.

 ■ 43% of organizations plan to add ML to their security 

operations, or are interested in doing so. 

 ■ The leading ML use cases are:

 j To identify cyber risks (39%).

 j To improve threat detection (37%).

 j To handle more incidents with 
junior\-level analysts (29%).

Frankly, we would’ve expected ml use to be even higher — and it 
might well be, since many organizations use ml\-based products 
without realizing ml is baked into them.

Data Problem 

Security teams are experiencing 
the impact of the Data Age: 
rapid digital transformation, 
most notably an aggressive 
shift to cloud. 

23

SeCurITy IS A DATA prOBlem

SeCurITy IS A DATA prOBlem

That shift was only accelerated by COVID\-19, and the SolarWinds 
attacks underscored the risks that come with rapidly increasing 
complexity. Together, the lessons of 2020 are fundamentally 
changing how security is — or should be — done.

If the challenge of the post\-COVID Data Age is the complexity 
of cloud services, hybrid architectures and convoluted supply 
chains, the opportunity is in all the data. With the right analytics 
tools, security teams can connect more data dots than ever 
to find more signs of anomalous activity, software and system 
vulnerabilities, and real\-time attacks. With the right automation, 
they can handle most problems much faster than through manual 
processes, without squandering scant human resources.

The survey data also recognizes related lessons:

 ■ Nearly all respondents — 88% — tell us that security 

spending will increase at their organizations.

 ■ 35% say it will increase significantly.

 ■ This is especially true in areas like cloud security 
(cited by 41%) and cyber risk management (32%).

 ■ Also significant: plans to add security\-focused analytics 
(22%) and a trend toward process automation (22%).

The best news in the research was a heightened degree of 
collaboration across the IT and security spectrum, and a closer 
focus on increasing security spending to solve cloud complexity 
through analytics, automation and investment in human talent.

In response to the challenges of the Data Age, we’ve pivoted into 
a new age of IT security. And while respondents emphasized that 
it’s harder than ever to keep up with ever\-escalating challenges, 
it appears that security experts are now moving to position 
themselves for future success.

Many security leaders are taking action to keep up with 
intensifying security challenges. More spending and more 
technology are only as good as the strategies behind them, 
so a focus on cloud complexity, with better analytics and 
a clearer view of your data, is essential. Here are our key 
recommendations, based on the research.

1\. Modernize the SOC.

Security teams are defending an increasingly amorphous 
battleground against a diverse, ever\-improving set of threats 
and adversaries. They need a cutting\-edge command center. Of 
the technologies and techniques listed below, none alone can 
completely meet the need. But together, they build a modern, 
more effective security operations center that’s up to taking on 
today’s threats.

Zero trust: Focused on users, assets and resources rather than 
a network perimeter, zero trust minimizes security risks. The 
model is built on three principles: Verify everyone and everything, 
provide the least privileged access, and assume you’ve been 
breached. Focusing on data security, zero trust rigorously 
authenticates the end user. It’s a necessary strategy shift for a 
more fragmented and distributed security environment. 

Security operations process automation: It’s essential. you 
can’t have human analysts respond to every attack. Instead, 
they can write the rules so that automated solutions identify 
and respond to those attacks without human intervention, and 
faster than a live actor could manage. Security orchestration, 
automation and response (SOAr) and user and entity behavior 
analytics (ueBA) are often where automation makes its mark.

Modern SIEM: This is where the analytics investment we found 
in our research comes to fruition. SIem systems offer full visibility 
into activity within your network, empowering you to respond to 
threats in real time.

Training and staffing: This is every organization’s struggle. 
All these other technologies help you do more with a leaner 
team, but ultimately, a growing organization facing growing 
threats needs to grow its security team. you can improve the 
effectiveness of your analysts through automation and analytics, 
and you can improve training by reducing the number of tools 
they have to use to get the job done.

2\. Set your sights on a 
consolidated view of data.

That modernized SOC will include an arsenal of the best 
tools and customization available. But that can create its own 
headaches, in terms of training and the ability to understand 
an incident with data from multiple sources. In a complex, 
multicloud, multi\-service environment, it’s essential to be able 
to see across all that data, not just traditional security data. This 
highest\-level, end\-to\-end perspective is vital not only to security 
and compliance efforts, but to successful development and 
operations as well. A consolidated view of the data creates a 
single source of truth for security and IT teams.

3\. Rethink your approach to 
supply chain threats.

4\. Press your collaborative 
advantage. 

After the SolarWinds hacks, we’re all worried about enemies who 
might use our friends to exploit our systems and networks. The 
first principle, to audit your vendors, is harder than it sounds, 
because your one “videoconferencing vendor” or “payment 
processing vendor” is actually composed of maybe a half\-dozen 
business systems, through external ApIs and services. you need 
visibility into every data component and flow. you also need to 
know how to respond quickest when a breach is discovered, 
both to shut it down and to determine which data may have 
been compromised. 

For supply chain threats (and any other kind), you need to 
improve your ability to see suspicious lateral movement within 
your networks. Whether bad guys sneak in through a vendor’s 
software patch or an employee’s stolen credentials, you’ll want to 
be able to spot them as they slither through your network looking 
for the goods.

But weak passwords, poor multifactor authentication methods 
and not using a single sign\-on solution can punch holes in this 
strategy. This is where organizations need a modern SOC, and a 
well\-defined and closely monitored identity policy with strong 
enforcement and monitoring, to fill those gaps.

Disaster response to COVID\-19 required quick action, and drove 
greater security/IT collaboration. Security teams should continue 
to build on this shift, because their job is to mitigate potential 
disasters. At its most fully realized, this takes an organization into 
DevSecOps, the melding of three interrelated disciplines that, 
frankly, aren’t usually as interrelated as they should be.

DevOps practices broke down the traditional silos between 
development and operations teams for faster software 
development and the high\-quality delivery of software and digital 
experiences. The next step is DevSecOps, integrating security. 
DevSecOps brings all three disciplines into one flow with shared 
goals and measurements, and tools and practices that reduce 
friction between the three traditionally siloed groups. This 
provides an opportunity for security automation and introduces 
security earlier in the development process.

even if your organization is not ready to embrace this full 
philosophical shift, you can use the singular experiences of 2020 
to advocate for the importance of integrated security thinking, 
at every stage of IT and the business.

After all, who knows what 2021 (and beyond) will hold.

The State of Security 2021 \| SplunkAppenDIx

Manufacturing
33% of manufacturers struggle with their number and types 
of devices — the highest percentage, and 1\.4 times the cross\-
industry average (24%).

manufacturers also suffer lost productivity slightly more than 
most, at 42%, compared with an average of 36%.

manufacturing companies lead in terms of integrating non\-
security data with security data to support decision\-making.

more manufacturers use software\-as\-a\-service solutions than any 
other industry (83%, versus an average of 69%).

to struggle to keep up with an overwhelming number of alerts.

Public sector
The public sector is most likely to use four or more IaaS and paaS 
providers: 19% vs. a cross\-industry average of 8%.

That number is expected to climb to 39% in two years, still leading, 
with the industry average expected to be 21%.

The public sector is most likely to have an on\-premises policy for 
new applications (24%, versus an average of 14%).

The public sector was least likely to report having suffered a data 
breach in the past two years (22%; the average was 39%).

Technology
54% of tech companies suffer from significant IT time for 
remediation following security incidents, compared with 
a 42% cross\-industry average.

retailers were also most likely to say that their security stack 
and the number of tools/vendors have become overwhelmingly 
complex (39%, versus an average of 25%).

They have also seen high rates of insider attacks: 44%, outdone 
only by communications/media, at 47%. The cross\-industry 
average was 27%.

Tech orgs, along with communications/media companies, 
report the highest uptick in attacks.

Insider attacks were most common in tech (44%) and 
communications/media companies (47%), compared with 
an average of 27%.

Key regional highlights
regional variations in the responses were surprisingly subtle in terms of their experiences 
and their response to the latest security threats, but there were a few notable differences:

respondents in europe are less concerned about SolarWinds\-
like attacks: 74% of their orgs are concerned/very concerned, 
whereas it’s 77% for north America and 86% for ApAC. But 
Western european orgs have most often increased their budget 
as a result (40% are planning the increase, versus 28% and 27% 
among north American and ApAC orgs, respectively).

european organizations are 1\.6 times as likely to have automated 
security processes with real\-time data (36%, versus 23% for north 
America and 23% for ApAC).

North America
north America leads in terms of public cloud infrastructure 
adoption — 47% of respondents there have more than half of their 
business\-critical applications and workloads in the public cloud, 
whereas it’s 40% for Western europe and 25% for ApAC.

With respect to cloud\-native apps, respondents in north America 
(52%) and europe (55%) more often report that consistency 
across clouds is an issue, as compared with 41% of ApAC orgs.

Asia Pacific (APAC)
ApAC organizations lag on cloud\-native application architecture 
adoption: 52% of them have no cloud\-native, business\-critical 
workloads at the moment, while that percentage is 44% for north 
American orgs and 49% for Western european orgs. however, 
ApAC will likely catch up — they on average anticipate 56% of 
business\-critical workloads to be cloud\-native 24 months from 
now, versus 57% for north America and 52% for Western europe.

With respect to cloud\-native apps, 38% of ApAC respondents 
cite issues with cloud infrastructure visibility (more frequently 
than north America, 25%, or Western europe, 26%). Also, 30% 
say that they struggle because of tools that don’t support cloud\-
native applications (versus 19% for north America and 20% for 
Western europe).

ApAC organizations currently report the lowest rate of remote 
work, at 50% (versus an average of 56%). pre\-COVID, north 
American organizations had the lowest rate of remote work — 
20%, versus 25% in ApAC and 26% in europe.

Western Europe
42% of european organizations tend to focus on malware 
detection in cloud\-native scenarios (versus 32% and 25%, for 
north America and ApAC, respectively).

With respect to cloud\-native applications, respondents in 
north America (52%) and europe (55%) more often report that 
consistency across clouds is an issue (as compared with 42% 
among ApAC orgs).
