Executive Summary

“There’s no silver bullet solution with cybersecurity, a layered 
defense is the only viable defense.” \- James Scott, Senior Fellow 
and co\-founder of ICIT

As security teams continue to search for ways to deter cyberattacks, it becomes more 

obvious that multiple lines of defense are the most sound strategy they can take. As 

business priorities increasingly revolve around engineering output and data privacy, 

multiple testing types integrate more closely with different stages of the Software 

Development Lifecycle and link up to discover vulnerabilities before it’s too late.

And yet there are issues that routinely slip past teams’ watchful eyes. As a pentest 

provider, Cobalt witnesses firsthand how vulnerabilities ranging from Low to High severity 

make it to software and systems that handle terabytes of sensitive information. 

We publish our annual State of Pentesting report to shed light on what those 

vulnerabilities are, and identify the trends and hazards that impact the cybersecurity 

community. We collect the data via our proprietary Pentest as a Service (PtaaS) 

platform, which connects security teams with a carefully curated and thoroughly 

vetted community of pentesters to examine their systems and software. 

This year, we looked at data from 1602 pentests performed in 2020 to learn about the assets 

getting tested, the vulnerabilities being discovered, and how that data changes across different 

industries and company sizes. We identified an interesting trend: our customers have been 

struggling with the same top 5 vulnerabilities for 4 years in a row. Despite the fact that they 

are well\-known to the industry, teams struggle to effectively remove and prevent issues 

like Server Security Misconfigurations and Cross\-Site Scripting from their environments. 

To understand why that was, we surveyed 601 companies (not Cobalt customers) to learn 

how they pursue secure development, how they pentest and remediate vulnerabilities, and 

where there is room for process improvements for both internal teams and security vendors. 

What we found was an interesting mixture of pain points, workflow challenges, 

and suggestions on how pentesting can evolve as a layer of defense that can 

help validate the effectiveness of all the other controls that come before it. 

Vulnerabilities

We began the hunt for trends by examining the data from our 
Pentest as a Service (PtaaS) platform. We looked at the types 
of tests we performed and the types of security issues our 
pentesters found in 2020\. From our sample of 1602 pentests, 
the majority of our customers came to us specifically for Web 
Application testing or Web App and API testing—nearly 75% of 
them. The rest of our sample was made up of combinations of 
Mobile, External Network, and Internal Network testing. 

How much risk are 
teams managing? 
When we discover vulnerabilities, we rate them according 

to the OWASP methodology, based on their likelihood of 

exploitation and impact if exploited. Likelihood includes the 

VULNERABILITY RISK RATING

level of skill an attacker would need to exploit a vulnerability, 

High: Vulnerabilities that introduce the most 

the availability of documented exploits, and the relative 

risk of disruption, due to the high impact and 

ease of exploitation. The Impact includes the effect on the 

high likelihood. Cobalt recommends addressing 

confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data or systems, 

vulnerabilities at this level as quickly as possible.

as well as potential financial or reputational losses. 

LowLow
53\.6%53\.6%

Medium: Vulnerabilities that introduce a 

moderate amount of business risk. These include 

risks with high impact but low likelihood, and 

risks with low impact but high likelihood. Cobalt 

recommends addressing these vulnerabilities to 

improve the overall security posture. 

Low: Vulnerabilities that introduce a 

relatively small amount of risk, but could 

still have some impact or likelihood. Cobalt 

recommends addressing these vulnerabilities 

when there are no higher priority items.

Medium

High\-risk vulnerabilities were in the minority among our customers, while more than 

half of the Findings we discovered were rated Low. However, we still recommend 

that clients address the Medium\- and Low\-risk vulnerabilities, because an attacker 

could find a way to chain several of those less\-severe findings together to gain 

greater access. We explore this observation in more detail under “Remediation.” 

Why Three Groups? A lot of pentesting organizations group vulnerabilities differently, 

having a Critical category for the most Likely and most Impactful vulnerabilities, 

and an Informational category for vulnerabilities with a very low risk. Cobalt sticks 

with the High, Medium, and Low categories because labeling one item as “Critical” 

can make other still\-risky vulnerabilities sound less important, and labeling an 

issue as “Informational” can make it sound like it’s not worth fixing.

What vulnerability categories are the 
most common? 
To get a glimpse of what flaws slip past security teams’ internal checks, we continue our analysis 

with the top 5 most common vulnerability categories that our pentester community discovered. 

Unsurprisingly, 2020’s list reveals vulnerabilities that are also outlined in the OWASP Top 10: 

Top 5 Most Common Vulnerabilities

1\. Server Security Misconfigurations: 28\.1% 

2\. Cross\-Site Scripting: 15\.5% 

3\. Broken Access Control: 14\.7% 

4\. Sensitive Data Exposure: 8\.4% 

5\. Authentication and Sessions: 8% 

We have analyzed our data for the 

State of Pentesting report every year 

since 2018, and these vulnerability 

categories have consistently been 

our top 5 for each report. The order 

in which they appear has shifted 

over time, but Server Security 

Misconfigurations have been at the 

top of the list, and by a significant 

margin, every year running. 

This leads us to believe that security teams are struggling to effectively remove and 

prevent issues that are well\-known to the industry. There can be several reasons for this—

gaps in secure development, insufficient investment in security awareness and training, 

ineffective remediation, or bugs staying open because of low perceived impact and/or 

lack of resources. We explore more anecdotal data on this point under “Remediation.”

Looking deeper into our data
This year we’re diving one level deeper into our analysis by observing the specific 

findings that come up across different methodologies, industries and company sizes. 

Going this granular helps us determine risk more accurately—for example, with Cross\-

Site Scripting the risk differs considerably between the Stored and Reflected findings. 

But first, a word on taxonomy. Different pentest providers—and cybersecurity 

organizations as a whole—use different terminology and frameworks to describe 

their data. To help readers follow our report, here is an overview of the taxonomy 

we use at Cobalt, which is mostly guided by OWASP best practices: 

The building block of our taxonomy are Findings, which are the individual issues our 

testers discover. Findings are then grouped into a vulnerability category. For example:

Cross\-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross\-Site Scripting (XSS)

Reflected XSS
Reflected XSS

Stored XSS
Stored XSS

Finding \#1: An instance of Reflected XSS. 

When an attacker passes script code to the 

server in a user\-editable location within a 

request, the application returns it as part of the 

server’s response, which the user’s browser 

interprets and renders as part of the page.

Finding \#2: An instance of Stored XSS. When 

an attacker passes script code to the server 

in a user\-editable location within a request, 

the application stores it on the server. When 

another user accesses the affected page, 

that user’s browser interprets and renders 

the stored code as part of the page.

Vulnerability Category: The root cause for both of these findings is that the application is 

vulnerable to Cross\-Site\-Scripting attacks, which happens when the application does not validate 

and encode user\-supplied input properly, so it gets treated as code, rather than as text.

6

With this system in mind, we looked at the top 5 findings from our entire 2020 

database, regardless of vertical or asset type. Here’s what we found:

At first glance, the percentages 

might look small, but that’s in part 

because of the total number of 

Top 5 Findings For 2020

findings we observe in our platform. 

1\. Broken Access Control: Insecure Direct Object 

Among 286 possible options that 

are grouped into 23 vulnerability 

categories, these top 5 findings were 

References (IDOR): 9\.4% of total findings

2\. Cross\-Site Scripting: Stored: 8\.7%

the most commonly discovered and 

3\. Components with Known Vulnerabilities: 

represent roughly 30% of our data.

Outdated Software: 4\.1%

It’s interesting to note that 

both of Cross\-Site Scripting’s 

variations appeared frequently 

in our pentests. Despite the fact 

that this vulnerability became 

4\. Broken Access Control: Username/

Email Enumeration: 3\.8%

5\. Cross\-Site Scripting: Reflected: 3\.7%

big news over 10 years ago—and some parts of the community have gone so far as to 

declare it dead—our data and the OWASP Top 10 lists suggest otherwise. And while this 

type of vulnerability is rarely reflected in big breach stories, its impact on both companies 

and their customers is not negligible, risking exposure to highly sensitive information.

What are different assets vulnerable to?
While the top 5 overall findings help set the tone for what specific issues security 

teams can focus on, they won’t be helpful to every reader. You’ll notice that 

many of these findings will relate to web assets, and that’s partly because 

the majority of pentests we did in 2020 covered web applications. 

To help readers determine the most prevalent threats to their mobile applications, 

networks, or even combinations of different assets, we’ve broken the data down 

to the top 3 findings observed from different testing methodologies.

None of these flaws are 0\-day vulnerabilities. All of them have been well\-known to the industry 

for years, which further strengthens our theory that there is an issue with prevention earlier in 

the Software Development Lifecycle. We explore this theme in more detail under “Remediation.”

What are different industries vulnerable to?
Some industries are under more pressure than others. For example, as the COVID\-19 pandemic 

disrupted the world in 2020, the Healthcare and E\-Learning industries saw an increase in 

cyber attacks. The FBI reported a 30% increase in attacks against E\-Learning targets, and 

many hospitals and vaccine manufacturers became the targets of phishing campaigns.

Based on news stories like these and our pentesting experience, we were interested 

in seeing what the data said on the industries that we pentest most frequently.

\*Study limitation: the majority of this data relates to Web applications/API assets. For a detailed 
breakdown of findings per asset type, please refer to “What are different assets vulnerable to?” 

While the order varied slightly from industry to industry, it looked like each 

dealt with similar flaws: variations of Cross\-Site Scripting, Insecure Direct 

Object References, and Outdated Software Version. That, however, doesn’t 

mean that different industries deal with the same level of risk. 

Consider the following: Many SaaS and Fintech companies completely rely on their 

technology to keep the business running. But larger enterprises in industries like 

Insurance and Healthcare are more likely to have multiple ventures and sources of 

revenue, so the tested technology could only be a small part of the bigger picture. 

What’s more, risk doesn’t end with the company’s business operations. It 

ultimately translates to impact on end users. For example, weak TLS ciphers in 

a banking app can be critical for both companies and their customers, while the 

same problem in a gardening app can be considerably less exploitative. 

This is also why we want to highlight one concerning trend: industries which are 

more likely to handle financial, health, or other sensitive data such as Healthcare, 

Insurance, and Fintech, are still susceptible to IDOR vulnerabilities. This well\-known 

flaw could allow an attacker to bypass authorization controls and access Personally 

9

Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI). These instances 

are examples of higher risk for both the company and its customers. We recommend 

that companies whose reports list this vulnerability address it as a high priority.

Aside from considering what industries are vulnerable to, it’s also worth exploring 

metrics that show how vulnerable they are. For example, it would be much 

less alarming if the number of findings per asset was contained to an average 

of 1 or 2, than if companies were observing a number closer to 10\.

In exploring this question, we learned that each industry had room to improve, 

but E\-Learning stood out both with its average number of findings, and 

what proportion of those carried High and Medium levels of risk. 

This could be because many E\-Learning businesses had to respond to surging demand 

for digital solutions during the pandemic. We can easily picture the scenario where 

businesses were pushed to prioritize faster deployments over secure development. 

Security teams likely looked to pentests to compensate for what slipped past 

internal checks—one of many examples of how pentests can act as an effective 

layer of defense if teams are able to effectively remediate their findings.

10

Remediation

Earlier in our report we found that the top 5 most common 
vulnerability categories in our database have stayed the same 
every year since 2018\. When we consult other sources, such as 
the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities report, this problem goes back 
even further. For example, Cross\-Site Scripting and Broken Access 
Control have made the list in each iteration since 2003\. Security 
Misconfigurations have also been a prevalent entry, dropping out 
of the list in 2007 only to reappear in later releases. 

This observation raises the inevitable question: why is the industry 

struggling with the same well\-known problems for so long?

To answer this, we wanted to better understand how security practitioners both 

prevent vulnerabilities and remediate what their pentests discover. We wanted to 

know if there were any internal issues that limited teams to higher priority items, but 

also if there were external factors that were coming from their pentest providers. 

In Q1 of this year, we spoke to 601 IT security professionals across the United States, 

Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, all of whom worked for companies with 500 or more 

employees. They were generally familiar with pentesting, and had previously used pentesting 

at their companies. More information on our methodology is included in Appendix B. 

To start, respondents identified and fixed 54 vulnerabilities on average 

in the last calendar year. And yet 6 out of 10 said they saw these same 

issues re\-emerge at a later date. Why? We have a few theories. 

Theory \#1: Detecting vulnerabilities before code 
goes live is still a work in progress. 

Before we dive into pentesting\-related theories, we want to look at the 

bigger picture and understand why preventable issues slip past initial 

checks and only come up after a third party tests for them.

Results: Nearly all respondents (96%) agreed that they have to follow 

secure development principles to prevent vulnerabilities from re\-emerging. 

We wanted to know how they work towards achieving that:

11

 
What security checks does your team have in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to 
find and fix vulnerabilities before pushing code to production?

Code Reviews

Threat Modeling

Playbooks \& Training

DAST/SAST/IAST Analysis

Abuse Case Tests

Fuzzing

Other

Following secure development principles doesn’t always mean that each of these points 

needs to be at 100%. Of the 43% who don’t use code reviews, for example, some might not 

be using it as diligently as they need to, while others might not need it in the first place. But 

the fact stands that vulnerabilities slip past these checks, as evidenced by our own data. 

What this graph can tell us is that security teams are using a combination of measures to prevent 

vulnerabilities early on, which is something we strongly support. It takes multiple approaches to 

secure one’s environment. Pentesting isn’t the panacea of application security, but it can validate 

all the other pieces of a security program and help inform what areas need to be improved. 

Theory \#2: Teams struggle to detect everything 
that slips past internal checks because they 
can’t pentest their entire application portfolio. 

In addition to this theory, we also wanted to see if there were other 

challenges, for example with procurement and setup.

Results: Even though 78% of study participants agree that pentesting is a high\-priority 

item for their security teams, respondents only conduct pentesting on 63% of their overall 

application portfolio on average. What challenges could be causing this disconnect?

12

0%20%40%60%• Talent Matching: 86% of respondents agreed that 
it is difficult to find and/or hire people with the 
right skill sets for pentesting. 

• Expense: 58% of our panelists believe that 

pentesting is too expensive, with 42% going so 
far as to say their company does not have the 
budget to cover it. 

• Scoping Difficulties: 61% said that pentesting is 

difficult to scope. 

• Timing: Over half of the security professionals we 
interviewed agreed that pentesting is too slow to 
schedule. How slow, exactly? Only 22% said they 
are able to get pentesting scheduled within days; 
most have to wait weeks (55%) and some even 
divulged that it takes their organization months 
(22%) to get a pentest project off the ground.

0%25%50%75%100%Aside from limiting how much teams can pentest, these pain points also lead to longer 

periods of time between new code being pushed, and pentests revealing where it is vulnerable. 

That can translate to months of exposure that no one is aware of and can mitigate. 

None of these setbacks are connected to how engineering and security teams 

work together. Instead, they are symptoms of a wider problem: the established 

pentesting procurement process makes this security control less accessible, and 

therefore less reliable. To enable security teams, pentests need to be available with 

appropriate talent on\-demand, with simpler setup and more flexible pricing. 

Theory \#3: Teams might be taking too long to 
address Medium\- or Low\-risk findings.

Results: Nearly all (93%) of respondents reported that 

their business solves critical vulnerabilities quickly. 

My company solves for critical vulnerablities quickly.

The response to Low\- or Medium\-risk vulnerabilities 

93% Agree

was more sluggish, with two\-thirds of our respondents

points. Over half (51%) confessed that their companies 

66% Agree

were too slow in responding to these lower\-risk issues, 

and 67% feel that this practice creates significant risk 

to business, considering that these supposedly low\-

urgency vulnerabilities can chain together and escalate 

into very serious problems. To minimize risk and prevent 

chained exploits, 79% of our study participants agreed 

that their organizations need to focus just as much 

on Low or Medium vulnerabilities as they do High. 

However, 25% of respondents reported that their 

company takes up to 60 days—or longer—to 

address Low/Medium\-risk vulnerabilities, and a 

small but nonetheless surprising segment (1%) of 

companies don’t bother to remediate them at all.

79% Agree

14

Why is this such poor practice? For a case study on the potentially disastrous consequences of 

postponing so\-called “low\-urgency” remediation, look no further than the 2017 Equifax breach. 

This breach exposed the personal information of 148 million people—more than 40% of the 

population of the United States at the time—and resulted in a record\-shattering $700 million 

FTC settlement, their CEO stepping down amid massive public controversy, and $1\.4 billion 

spent cleaning up the mess. So how did this catastrophic breach occur? It happened because 

of a widely\-known software vulnerability for which a patch was made available—a patch that 

Equifax, due to oversight in their internal processes, failed to deploy. Cobalt’s Chief Strategy 

Officer Caroline Wong breaks it down: “This was not a crazy technical problem that lacked a 

solution. The technical solution was available; this was a lack of people and process innovation.” 

Theory \#4: Remediation teams could be limited 
to critical findings because of workflow issues. 

Results: There is definite room for improvement here. Security and engineering teams still 

have work to do to effectively collaborate, on remediation priorities and more generally. The 

outcome is lower\-risk findings staying exposed for longer and coming up again at a later test.

How would you describe the current relationship 
between the security and engineering teams within 
your organization?

What is holding them back? Largely, 

the answers are inefficient workflows 

and lack of automation integrations.

A majority of security respondents 

agreed that they can collaborate 

better with their engineering 

colleagues—much better, in some 

cases. Half of our respondents 

reported that the relationship 

between security and engineering 

teams within their company 

was strong, but with room for 

improvement; 18% said the relationship between these teams was neutral, in that 

their teams occasionally worked together, but not as often as they should; and 2% 

of respondents called this relationship poor, reporting that their team rarely worked 

together with engineers at their company. Only 3 in 10 respondents were able to happily 

report that their company’s security and engineering teams were “intertwined.”

So what are the biggest challenges teams need to address in order to improve DevSecOps 

workflows? We posed this question to our respondents and here is what they had to say: 

15

 
 
What are the biggest challenges your team faces when 
implementing DevSecOps?

Too many manual processes

Knowledge gaps re. other team’s area

Lack of AppSec tool integrations

Security teams too small to keep up

Misalignment between KPIs

Let’s focus on manual processes and AppSec tool integrations, particularly 

around remediating pentest findings. Once security teams have pentest findings 

in hand, how are they sending them over to their colleagues in engineering?

Nearly three\-quarters of respondents said that this was handled manually within their 

organization—either the findings were manually pushed to issue tracking software (39%) or 

worse, the engineering team was manually sent a PDF shared by the pentest provider (34%). 

Perhaps then it is not surprising that when there was misalignment with remediation priorities, 

half our respondents said that their engineering teams blamed workflow inefficiencies.

Why is this important? 

Most of the time the engineering 

team also makes up the remediation 

team—and asking them to address 

Low\- and Medium\-risk findings with 

the same urgency as highly critical 

ones is a big request when you factor 

in their commitments to roadmap 

execution, business enablement, and 

customer satisfaction. Clearly, security 

teams cannot pile requests onto these 

teams unless they explore ways to free up their time with more efficient and automated 

processes. For example, engineering is not involved in pentesting setup or execution and 

they rarely have a say in how findings are packaged and shared with them—these are all 

handled by the security team. Therefore, the responsibility lies with the latter to improve 

this workflow in order to push toward DevSecOps and remediate more effectively. 

16

0%20%40%60%Conclusion

Our data strongly suggests that security teams are still struggling with the same well\-known 

vulnerabilities that have plagued the industry for years. Flaws like Cross\-Site Scripting and 

Broken Access Control, which were among the top 5 vulnerabilities in our 2020 data, have 

also been listed as a prevalent security issue in the OWASP Top 10 every year since 2003\. 

As much as teams aim for secure development, we conclude there are still 

gaps in prevention and remediation. As to what might be causing them, 

and where pentesting plays a part, we discovered the following: 

1\. The majority of teams pursue some form of secure 

development, but they don’t catch everything. Pentesting 
is still a valuable and effective layer of defense. 

2\. To empower security teams to test new code earlier, 

pentesting needs to be faster and easier to set up, and 
more financially accessible. 

3\. Ignoring or delaying remediation for Medium\- and Low\-risk 
pentest findings can escalate into a larger issue that is 
more costly to fix. 

4\. What holds remediation teams back with fixing pentest 
findings are too many manual tasks and a lack of tool 
integrations.

17

For the final point, we tested a few innovation ideas with our survey respondents to learn 

what they felt is the best way to improve workflows and get more done with less. The 

most popular was real\-time delivery of findings instead of a PDF report (57%), closely 

followed by choosing a provider that offers software integrations that automatically 

share information and status updates between both teams’ dashboards (56%). Half 

our respondents wanted to see API integrations that allow for data consolidation 

and visualization, and an honorable mention went to dedicated communication 

channels for security, engineering, and pentesters to collaborate (37%). 

What do you think is the best way to align pentesting 
with both security and engineering roadmaps?

Appendix A: How to fix and prevent 
the most common vulnerabilities

The following chart contains information about the 13 vulnerabilities we mentioned across this report. It includes 

a short summary of the Finding, and broad advice for ensuring that your assets are protected against them. 

We draw these recommendations from the expertise of our security researchers and pentesters, and 

from established cybersecurity communities’ best practices, such as the OWASP’s Cheat Sheet Series 

and the SANS CIS Controls. The guidance in this report is also documented in our platform.

Broken Access Control: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

Due to the way a website or application handles resources, one 

customer’s file has an ID in the URL, for example “file123”,

direct object reference from an untrusted source 

includes an access control check to ensure the 

user is authorized for the requested object. 

Stored Cross\-Site Scripting (XSS)

A web form has a field on it that accepts user text input,

then stores that input somewhere on the server’s database. 

For example, a name field on a social media site.

An attacker accesses that web form, and enters a line of

code, which the server accepts and stores in the database. 

4\. Create a whitelist of allowed characters. 

The next time a user pulls up data that includes the attacker’s 
input (such as accessing the attacker’s social media profile), 

their browser attempts to run whatever code they entered.

5\. Use a well\-known and secure encoding API for input 
and output encoding, such as the OWASP ESAPI. 

6\. Never try to write input and output encoders 
unless absolutely necessary. Research 

and use an existing output encoder.

A website passes a piece of information in a 

URL or other user\-editable location, which the 

server reflects back when that URL is sent.

An attacker creates a URL that contains a string of

another user, the browser accepts that code string and 

performs whatever actions the string describes.

Note: While Stored and Reflected XSS attacks 
function differently, the methods for remediating 

them follow the same design principles.

An attacker could search databases of documented 

vulnerabilities to find information about exploiting 

one of these outdated pieces of software.

It may also be worth considering a vulnerability scanner, 

which can report software that has gone out\-of\-date, 

and any documented vulnerabilities related to it.

Note: For more information about patches and 
updates to specific software and hardware in your 

environment, contact the relevant vendors.

Broken Access Control: Username or Email Enumeration

displays a message saying it’s valid (such as “We are sending 

a password reset email”). When they enter an invalid response, 

the server displays a different message (like, “user not found”). 

An attacker can use different responses to determine 

what items on a list of potential usernames and email 

addresses are valid. This could be a list of identified users 

from past breaches, or guesses based on common first 

and last names in Census data. The attacker can then 

use their list of legitimate usernames to attack users.

it sends some information in an HTTP header. A lot of 

these headers instruct the browser how to interact with

information encrypted. Meaning that it uses complex 

ciphers to make that data unreadable to anyone other than 

the intended recipient, and uses secure Transport Layer 

Security (TLS) protocols to send that information securely. 

However, some of these transport protocols have 

become outdated, meaning it is possible for an attacker 

to break into older secure communication channels 

and decrypt the information. Some configurations also 

allow an attacker to downgrade a communication from 

a stronger cipher suite to one that they can crack. 

Weak SSL Configuration: Insecure Cipher Suites

is encrypted. Ciphers are the secret codes used to encrypt 

information and make it impossible to read without knowing 

the cipher itself. The goal is to ensure that people other 

than the intended recipient can’t decode the message.

However, some suites of ciphers are old enough 

that they have been “broken”, and can be reliably 

translated back into the original text.

server with a specific X.509 certificate or public key instead 
of accepting any certificate signed by a trusted Certificate 

Authority. After storing, or “pinning”, the server certificate 

or public key, the mobile app will only connect to the known 

server only. This instructs the application not to trust external 

Certificate Authorities, which reduces the attack surface.

Even if the information is encoded and not human\-readable, 

an attacker could use various techniques to determine which

For some server use\-cases, a piece of software

vulnerabilities is to avoid allowing software to evaluate 

and perform its intended function. For example,

user\-supplied terms for a database search. 

If an attacker supplies a line of code that the server 

recognizes as a command, a vulnerable server may 

execute that code and perform an unexpected function. 

By executing the command, the server or application 

could give an attacker a privilege or capability 

that the attacker would not otherwise have.

Command injection can be an issue with wrapper programs.

However, if there is no way to achieve the same 

result without code evaluation, ensure that any user 

input is validated very strongly, placing as many 

restrictions as possible on that user input.

Server Security Misconfiguration: Using Default Credentials

When an application, Operating System, networked 

device, or other piece of software is installed, it

for an attacker to gain access by providing

Administrative panel, or it may create this account 

with a generated password during set\-up. This Admin 

username and password may be written in some published 

documentation, or it may be available on the Internet. 

If this password is predictable, no one changes it on 

the first access, an attacker could look up the password 

and gain unauthorized access to the application. 

2\. Always change any kind of default credentials as the 
first step of setting up any kind of environment.

3\. Ensure that all passwords meet or exceed 

proper password strength requirements. Cobalt 

recommends at least 12 characters, with complex 

characters (symbols, capital letters, numbers). 

Longer passwords are more difficult to crack.

4\. If possible, consider disabling external access 
for systems with Administrative features.

While the fixes listed above should improve the security posture of your application and environments, 

Cobalt still recommends pentesting on at least an annual basis. This report is not a substitute for a 

pentest. Our database contains well over 100 vulnerabilities, and we have mentioned just a handful 

in this report. Regular pentesting can catch additional flaws beyond those we mention here, and 

can find new ones that may get added as you make changes to your systems. You can also learn 

about these and other vulnerabilities on the OWASP, SANS CIS Controls, and CVE websites.

Cobalt’s State of Pentesting report includes two types of data sets: 

• Anonymized pentest data collected via Cobalt’s proprietary Pentest as a Service platform (referred to later 

as “Cobalt’s Pentest Data”);

• Survey responses on questions related to pentest procurement, setup, delivery and following remediation 

(referred to later as “Survey Collection”)

Cobalt’s Pentest Data Methodology

The data used in this report represents all pentests executed via Cobalt’s Pentest as a Service 

platform from January 1st 2020 to December 31st 2020\. Cobalt delivers third\-party pentest services 

via the Cobalt platform with the help of a highly curated and collaborative pentest community.

The reported data includes information on the types of assets that were tested and their discovered 

vulnerabilities, which are broken down to vulnerability categories and associated findings. This accounts for 

a total of 1602 pentests. The data represents large and small companies, a variety of industries ranging from 

SaaS to Insurance and Fintech, and 4 geographic regions: EMEA, APAC, North America and South America.

One limitation of this study is the high concentration of pentests commissioned for Web applications 

and APIs. Combined, these represent roughly 74% of all discovered findings, which is driven entirely 

by customers’ decisions on what to have pentested. Despite the unequal distribution across asset 

types, categories like Mobile applications and Internal and External networks still had enough 

statistically significant data to allow the authors to identify prevalent vulnerabilities for each. 

Survey Collection

To explore questions raised in the first half of the report, the authors commissioned an additional survey into 

how security practitioners procure and manage pentests, and how they remediate discovered vulnerabilities. The 

survey collected responses from 601 security professionals who work for companies with 500\+ employees and 

live and work either in the United States, or in the DACH region (Germany, Austria and Switzerland). To qualify, 

respondents had to have a general familiarity with and history of using pentesting throughout their careers.
