## When Software is Everywhere, Security is Everything

The way your company develops and depends on software has changed – and
never has it exposed you to more risk. When software is everywhere, everything
becomes an attack surface. And while software security has never been more
business critical, you know if it gets in the way of DevOps, it just won’t work.
Security must be inseparable from development.

Now, Software = Security.
