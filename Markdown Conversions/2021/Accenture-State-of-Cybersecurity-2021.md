respondents around the current state of 
cybersecurity resilience, we found that 
many CISOs feel recognition for their role 
in fulfilling the business strategy is well 
overdue—85% agree or strongly agree 
that the cybersecurity strategy is developed 
with business objectives, such as growth 
or market share, in mind. 

Yet, most business executives (78%) said that 
they don’t know how or when a cybersecurity 
incident will affect their organizations. It’s a 
sentiment that continues to increase from 
our 2020 report when it was still high at 69%. 

A majority of respondents (81%) say that 
“staying ahead of attackers is a constant 
battle and the cost is unsustainable” compared 
with 69% in 2020\. In fact, we found that 
respondents experienced a 32% increase 
over 2020 in the number of successful 
cyber attacks, while some attacks, such as 
ransomware, have seen a much higher increase.

This year, we continued our exploration 
of leaders in cyber resilience. Due to the 
rapid increase in high\-profile attacks and 
sheer complexity of handling cybersecurity 
demands, we also tested what difference 
it made to cyber resilience if there was a 
stronger alignment between cybersecurity 
practices and the business strategy.

What is cyber resilience?

The cyber\-resilient business brings together the 
capabilities of cybersecurity, business continuity 
and enterprise resilience. It embeds security 
across the business ecosystem and applies fluid 
security strategies to respond quickly to threats, 
so it can minimize the damage and continue 
to operate under attack. As a result, the cyber\-
resilient business can introduce innovative 
offerings and business models securely across 
the entire value chain, strengthen customer 
trust and grow with confidence.

resilience (Figure 1\). At the head of the pack 
is a group of Cyber Champions—organizations 
that strike a balance, not only excelling at cyber 
resilience, but also aligning with the business 
strategy to achieve better business outcomes. 
They are successful in at least three out of 
four cyber resilience performance criteria— 
better at stopping attacks, finding and fixing 
breaches faster and reducing their impact.

We also identified two new groups that reflect 
different approaches to cyber resilience: Business 
Blockers who put cybersecurity first over alignment 
with the business strategy and Cyber Risk Takers 
who put business strategy first over alignment 
with cybersecurity. The fourth level of cyber 
resilience we’ve identified as The Vulnerable. 

It matters where organizations fall within this 
cyber quadrant—there’s money on the table. 
Business Blockers stand to reduce their cost 
of breaches by 48%, Cyber Risk Takers by 65% 
and The Vulnerable by 71% if they increased 
their performance to Cyber Champion levels.

Business Blockers
Prioritize cyber resilience over 
alignment with business strategy, 
sometimes perceived as an 
impediment to business objectives.

Cyber Champions
Strike a balance between 
cyber resilience and business 
objectives with strong alignment 
to business strategy, best at 
protecting key assets.

The Vulnerable
Security not aligned with business 
strategy, immature cybersecurity 
operations, secure the bare minimum.

Cyber Risk Takers
Prioritize business growth and 
speed to market, most aligned 
with business strategy, accept 
higher cyber risk.

Even a global pandemic can’t stop 
cyber criminals—if anything, the 
vulnerability and uncertainty was 
a breeding ground for new attacks. 
There were on average 270 attacks 
(unauthorized access of data, 
applications, services, networks 
or devices) per company over the 
year, an increase of 31% compared 
with 2020 (Figure 2\). 

Third\-party risk continues to dominate. 
Indirect attacks—by which we mean successful 
breaches to the organization through the supply 
chain—have increased from 44% to 61%. 

And the impact of cybersecurity has hit hard 
in the boardroom; in an analysis of more than 
500 companies’ 2020 earnings reports, there’s 
an increase in legal (23%), economic (16%) and 
internal (10%) discussions around cybersecurity 
consequences compared with 2019, suggesting 
an elevation in prioritizing the subject.1

IT security budgets are increasing, 
with more than 82% of our survey 
respondents saying their budgets 
have increased in the last year (Figure 3\). 
IT security budgets are now up to 15% 
of total IT spend, 5 percentage points 
higher than the spend reported in 2020\.2 

This may be the COVID\-19 change event— 
the massive and rapid shift in how they ran 
their businesses and increased security 
demands; we won’t know until next year if this 
kind of investment will continue but we do 
know that budgets are always under scrutiny. 
Rapid cloud adoption may also contribute to this 
investment increase since many security tools 
have to be updated to accommodate cloud or 
more robust security is needed in a digital world.

Perhaps this increased spend has encouraged 
optimism. On average, 70% believe their 
organization is actively protected by their 
cybersecurity program, compared with 60% in 
2020\. While they are also more confident about 
the wider picture—67% believe their ecosystems 
to be secure, compared with 60% in 2020\.

“During my four year tenure, we tripled, 
maybe quadrupled the security budget. 
We were starting from ground zero, 
so we had to overinvest in security systems 
and infrastructure to get it up to where 
it needed to be.”

relationship with security

Over the next three to five years, 
more than two\-thirds of workloads 
will shift to the cloud, with about 
one\-third of organizations moving 
more than 75% into the cloud 
across most regions of the world.3 

This is echoed in our recent technology 
innovation strategies research which found 
that the top 10% of respondents doubled down 
on technology investment during the pandemic 
—72% accelerated investment in security.4

Our cyber resilience survey respondents 
have moved their operations to the cloud 
because they recognize the benefits such 
as lower costs, more resilient operations 
and access to more advanced technology. 

Yet, despite most of our survey respondents 
believing that cloud applications and operations 
are more secure than those hosted on\-premise, 
nearly one\-third (32%) say security is not part 
of the cloud discussion from the outset and 
their organization is trying to catch up (Figure 4\). 

And reasons preventing the take up of the cloud 
revolve around security issues: about one\-third 
of all respondents say poor governance and 
compliance practices around cloud security 
are a problem, that cloud security is too complex 
and that they do not have the skills internally 
to structure a proper cloud security framework.

to explore how winning organizations 
tackle cyber resilience, evaluating their 
responses based on the following key 
measures of cyber resilience: they 
stop more attacks, find and fix breaches 
faster and reduce breach impact.

We also looked at the impact on cyber resilience 
from being aligned with the business strategy 
and identified four levels of cyber resilience: 
Cyber Champions, Business Blockers, Cyber 
Risk Takers and The Vulnerable (Figure 5\).

Let’s examine the differences in the cyber 
quadrant positions and the implications for 
business performance and cyber resilience.

Business Blockers take a security\-first approach 
and place less emphasis on alignment with 
the business strategy. They are sometimes 
seen as an impediment to business objectives.

Why alignment mattersBusiness Blockers outperform Cyber Risk 
Takers and The Vulnerable, but lag Cyber 
Champions across all key measures of cyber 
resilience. As illustrated in Figure 6, they 
experience fewer breaches than Cyber Risk 
Takers and The Vulnerable, but 8 percentage 
points more than Cyber Champions (17%). 

Business Blockers also have the highest 
percentage of CISOs with full authority to 
approve budgets (32%) versus Cyber Champions 
(21%), Cyber Risk Takers (21%) and The Vulnerable 
(16%). This CISO\-driven spending autonomy may 
explain the increased focus on cybersecurity 
over business strategy.

When it comes to the average share of significant 
attacks—with high\-profile, severe and long\-term 
impact on the organization’s business or mission 
—they experience fewer than Cyber Risk Takers 
or The Vulnerable, but nearly 2X more than 
Cyber Champions.

And when attacks get through, Business Blockers 
detect and remediate them more quickly than 
Cyber Risk Takers and The Vulnerable, but lag 
Cyber Champions by a day on both measures.

already\-robust cybersecurity foundation, 
they will have even stronger cyber resilience, 
without sacrificing business outcomes.

Business Blockers could reduce costs by 
48% per successful attack if they increased 
their performance to Cyber Champion 
levels, with savings of about US$294,000 
per attack (Figure 7\).

Cyber Risk Takers take a business\-first 
approach and place less emphasis on alignment 
with the cybersecurity strategy. They report 
higher probability of meeting or exceeding their 
business objectives, but their business focus 
comes at the expense of cybersecurity success.

Why alignment mattersCyber Risk Takers lead in achieving business 
outcomes in eight business areas in our 
survey including cost reduction, business 
growth, faster time to market, gaining market 
share, developing new products/services, 
entering new markets, improved customer 
satisfaction and frictionless user experiences.

Significantly, Cyber Risk Takers secure a 
higher cyber budget—and yet successful 
breaches are still twice as high as Business 
Blockers and 10 percentage points higher 
than The Vulnerable. Securing more budget 
doesn’t translate to better cyber resilience. 

Despite being focused on business objectives, 
Cyber Risk Takers’ performance is among 
the poorest when it comes to average share 
of successful breaches and the average 
share of significant attacks (Figure 8\).

—they lack visibility, unclear metrics delay 
investment decisions and they demonstrate 
a poor allocation of funds. With fewer 
CISOs authorizing the security budget it 
may be that these Cyber Risk Takers are cash 
rich but expertise poor when it comes to 
how to spend their cybersecurity budgets.

While a focus on alignment alone may 
enable potential for meaningful business 
benefits, without a foundation for cyber 
resilience companies will be at greater risk 
and have higher costs of cybersecurity.

Cyber Risk Takers could reduce costs by 65% 
per successful attack if they increased their 
performance to Cyber Champion levels, with 
savings of about US$226,000 per attack (Figure 9\).

Cyber Champions are the cream of the crop. 
Like Business Blockers, Champions are among 
the top 30% in at least three of the four cyber 
resilience criteria. What sets them apart is 
their close alignment to the business strategy.

19

Why alignment mattersThe number of successful breaches experienced 
by Cyber Champions is 8 percentage points lower 
than Business Blockers and 36 percentage points 
lower than Cyber Risk Takers and they experience 
the fewest significant attacks (Figure 10\).

Cyber Champions have a speedier response 
to detection and remediation—a day extra 
of being fully operational can make all the 
difference to the bottom line.

Cyber Champions are better able to protect 
themselves from loss of data—about 4% of 
Cyber Champions lose more than 500,000 
records—6\.5X less than Cyber Risk Takers at 27%. 

Some of the Cyber Champions’ success in 
aligning with the business could be as a result 
of the fact that they have a higher share of 
business unit leads responsible for cybersecurity 
—nearly twice (1\.9X) that of Cyber Risk Takers.

CISOs must move away from security\- 
focused silos and collaborate with the right 
executives in the organization to understand 
business risks and priorities. By drawing 
on the experience and insights of the wider 
leadership team, CISOs can gain a broader 
perspective that serves the whole business well. 

When it comes to budget authorization, only 19% 
of Cyber Champions have their budgets authorized 
by the CEO or Board, compared to 23% for Business 
Blockers and 39% for Cyber Risk Takers (Figure 12\). 
This suggests that Cyber Champions have more 
autonomy when it comes to the purse strings and 
are less reliant on the CEO and Board for approval. 

We found that Cyber Champions set 
themselves apart in terms of their reporting 
structures. Around 70% of the group report 
to the CEO and Board and they demonstrate 
a far closer relationship with the CFO— 
reporting is 7X higher than the other groups.

And Cyber Champions tap into these 
relationships when it comes to defining 
the strategy. They consult most with CEOs 
(51%) and CFOs (49%) when developing 
their organization’s cybersecurity strategy— 
almost twice as much as the Business Blockers. 

“The business is heavily aligned with 
the CISO: The reason is very simple. 
Cyber is one of the top three priorities 
communicated by our chairperson 
and by top management… but if you 
don’t have the okay from cyber, the 
product simply doesn’t move on.”

CISOs only have to reflect on the 160% year\- 
on\-year increase in ransomware events in 2020 
to recognize that cyber attacks are prompting 
a “prevention is better than cure” approach.5 

Given remediation can be 30X the cost of 
prevention, once a ransomware attack happens, 
one of the biggest challenges when it takes 
down an enterprise environment is understanding 
priorities. What is the most important system to 
recover in your network? What does your revenue 
rely on? What’s most critical to your operations?

Keeping attackers out of your environment depends 
on security leaders closely aligning with the business 
as partners in driving down risk. This alignment 
helps to embed security into the business priorities. 

Cyber Champions understand the importance 
of balancing security and the business— 
they measure and monitor often to continuously 
improve their security function and enable the 
business to manage risk.

We found nearly 90% of Cyber Champions measure 
the maturity of their cybersecurity program at 
least annually or more frequently, 18% more than 
the Business Blockers (Figure 13\). This indicates 
that Cyber Champions clearly understand the risks 
while Business Blockers may be blind to them.

By measuring and monitoring their risk profiles 
and making that data available to leadership, 
CISOs can better align with the business. 

“We track data in four areas: cybersecurity 
effectiveness, the company’s cyber culture, 
cybersecurity readiness and cybersecurity 
resilience. We monitor how well we 
align our plans with core processes 
and what’s going on in the business.”

Security should be embedded consistently 
in the cloud. Too often, it is added at the 
end of the cloud\-first journey and can 
delay business outcomes—or result in 
having to do the costly work all over again. 

Cloud security can enable better business 
outcomes by being fast, frictionless, 
scalable, proactive and cost effective.6

With an accelerated shift toward using the 
cloud, it is important to drive full value from 
it. When moving to the cloud, organizations 
should seize the opportunity to reset their 
security posture, earlier and more effectively 
—like our Cyber Champions do. 

Most Cyber Champions (83%) say that security 
is a major consideration when moving operations 
to the cloud versus 70% of the overall sample. 
Cyber Champions are better at baking security 
into their cloud initiatives—they don’t see security 
involvement as a significant barrier to cloud 
discussions (Figure 14\). 

Cyber Champions know what to do; they work 
in close alignment with the business to migrate 
to the cloud more securely.

on the same page?

Our latest survey shows that there are still differences 
in how security and non\-security executives see things. 
In all, their responses highlight gaps between security 
and non\-security executives in how they perceive security 
effectiveness, budget and attack risks (Figure 15\). 

When we asked about the barriers preventing their organizations from 
realizing cybersecurity objectives, there was an average 14 percentage points 
difference between non\-security and security responses on seven significant 
factors. In particular, they disagreed about security involvement in cloud 
discussions—43% of non\-security executives versus 31% of security executives 
said that security was not part of the discussion and are now trying to catch up. 

These differences of opinion may reflect higher confidence on the part 
of the security executives for their cyber resilience. Or it may indicate that 
security executives need to work harder at integrating into the business 
so that priorities are agreed and clear. Either way, it’s important for security 
and business executives to better align so that business outcomes can be 
targeted, measured and met.

The path to 
cyber resilience

2727

Copyright © 2021 Accenture. All rights reserved. Accenture and its logo are registered trademarks of Accenture.Although this has been a year like no other, it has emphasized the 
critical role of cybersecurity within the business and how important 
it is for cybersecurity and business strategies to align.

We’re seeing familiar challenges that 
we’ve noted in the past—cyber attacks 
are spiralling upward, security investments 
are still on the rise and security’s relationship 
with cloud continues to prove challenging. 

Even the CISOs stature in the organization 
has grown—more CISOs than ever report 
directly to CEOs or Boards (72% in 2021 
compared with 59% in 2020\) and they’re being 
given more direct control over their budgets.

In such a climate, where change is the 
byword, seeking out the best way to 
run security operations can make all 
the difference. It is not a one\-way street. 

As we have seen in this report, organizations 
that focus solely on business growth are 
missing out on the benefits of cyber resilience. 
And there are gains for those organizations 
that proactively seek out a strong synergistic 
alignment between security and the business. 

By aligning their cybersecurity efforts with 
the business strategy, organizations can 
not only achieve better business outcomes, 
but also seize an advantage in the race 
to cyber resilience. 

“Leadership is now highly invested 
in things like cyber resiliency; there’s a 
willingness to put more money that way. 
It’s a conversation that’s happening right 
now and it’s better than it ever was before.”

Demographics

The State of Cybersecurity Resilience 2021 
research surveyed 4,744 executives in March 
and April of 2021 to understand the extent to 
which organizations prioritize security, how 
comprehensive their security plans are and 
how their security investments are performing. 
The executives represent organizations with 
annual revenues of US$1B or more from 
18 countries and 23 industries across North 
and South America, Europe and Asia Pacific.

Continuing our approach from previous years, 
we first defined leaders in cyber resilience 
as those who exhibit high\-performance (top 20% 
of sample) in at least three of the following four 
performance criteria:

The average cost per attack was the sum of the 
product of the daily cost of an attack by damage 
type, the days to detect and fix an attack of this 
damage type and the proportion of attacks for 

this damage type. The total number of attacks 
was the product of the security breach ratio and 
the total number of attempted breaches (Figure 16\). 

Figure 16\. Modeling formula to assess the cost of cyber crime

• Stop more attacks

• Find breaches faster

• Fix breaches faster

• Lower breach impact

We then conducted a series of “what if” 
experiments to explore the return on investment 
of improving these cybersecurity practices. 
We created a formula to assess the cost of cyber 
crime for a company: the average cost per attack, 
multiplied by the total number of attacks.

Note: For the modeling exercises, we ran our analysis on a sample of 3,455 organizations that responded to all key components of the cost of cyber crime model. 
We assume variables in purple to remain constant in the series of “what if” experiments we conduct. Damage type includes attacks that are: (1\) Significant,
(2\) Moderate, (3\) Minor and (4\) No impact.

of 3,455 organizations that responded to all key 
components of the cost of cyber crime model.

Both components are rescaled to between 0 and 100 and averaged to arrive at 
a final alignment score. Taking these definitions of cyber resilience and alignment, 
we grouped our sample into four levels of cyber resilience: 

Next, we examined how strength of 
alignment between cybersecurity strategy 
and business strategy impacted cyber 
resilience. Strength of alignment was 
defined by the following components: 

1\. The extent to which business objectives 
(e.g. cost reduction, business growth, 
customer satisfaction) are a priority for 
the organization’s overall business strategy 
and the extent to which cybersecurity 
is consulted when planning for these 
 business areas.

2\. The extent to which respondents agreed 

or disagreed with statements on alignment 
(e.g. organization\-wide involvement in 
understanding and mitigating cyber risk, 
and leadership involvement in setting 
cyber strategy and budgets.)
