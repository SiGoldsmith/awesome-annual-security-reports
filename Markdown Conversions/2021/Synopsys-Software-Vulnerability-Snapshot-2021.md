Overview

Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center (CyRC) researchers recently examined 
anonymized data from commercial software systems and applications tested by 
Synopsys application security testing services during 2020\. The following report 
includes data from 3,900 tests conducted on 2,600 targets (i.e., software or systems). 
Almost all of the tests (98%) were intrusive “opaque box” and “semi\-opaque box” tests, 
including penetration tests, dynamic application security tests, and mobile application 
security analyses.

Types of Security Testing

The majority of the tests—98%—were intrusive “opaque box” and “semi\-opaque box” tests, including penetration testing, dynamic 
application security testing, and mobile application security analyses. Opaque box testing approaches the target’s security state 
from an outsider’s perspective, whereas semi\-opaque box testing simulates an authenticated user with credentials—essentially 
extending opaque box testing with deeper insights. The tests were designed to probe running applications as a real\-world 
attacker would, with the goal of identifying vulnerabilities that could then be triaged and remediated as necessary.

The targets tested were largely web (83%) and mobile (12%) applications, with the remainder either source code or network 
systems/applications. The industries represented included software and internet (29%), financial services (28%), business 
services (14%), manufacturing (10%), media and entertainment (9%), and healthcare (5%). The remaining 5% of test targets 
represented education, energy and utilities, and other verticals.

The tests focused on identifying software weaknesses, known as Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). These are flaws or 
errors in code that when left unaddressed can make software or a system vulnerable to attack.

About Third\-Party Application Security Testing Services

Organizations use third\-party application security testing services such as those offered by Synopsys for a variety of reasons. 
Some want to validate their own testing and ensure their internal security controls are working. Others need to comply with 
regulatory or business requirements that mandate a third\-party assessment, while still others want to extend their software 
security testing without having to add specialized tools and staff. The 2021 BSIMM12 Insight and Trends report found that 87% 
of the organizations participating in the Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM) project use external penetration testers to 
uncover issues that might have been missed by internal testing.

The Need for a Complete Software Security Testing Spectrum

Businesses that sell software, or sell products that include embedded software, can’t afford software security, compliance, 
or quality issues compromising those products. Even businesses not directly engaged in selling software or software\-
driven products depend on software quality and security. For example, software drives the administrative systems for most 
payroll, billing, receivables, sales tracking, and customer records. Software controls production, manages inventories, directs 
warehousing, and runs the distribution systems that keep a business running. 

Software is also the primary way that most businesses interact with and support customers, and these systems can also 
fall prey to attack. The giant credit risk assessment firm Equifax is not considered a software company, but a breach of the 
underlying software framework of an Equifax customer portal exposed the personal data of 143 million U.S. consumers in 2017\.

Humans should perform the security tests 
they’re the most effective at carrying out,

with their efforts augmented by 
automated testing.

Software risk is business risk, and to effectively manage the second, you must address the first. While “transparent box” testing 
such as static application security testing (SAST) can bring visibility to security issues early in the software development life 
cycle, SAST cannot uncover runtime security vulnerabilities. And some vulnerabilities cannot be easily detected by automated 
testing tools—they need human oversight to be uncovered. 

For example, the only effective way to detect an insecure direct object reference (IDOR), an issue that allows attackers to 
manipulate references in order to gain access to unauthorized data, is by having a human perform a manual test. Clearly, there 
is no one best approach to application security testing. Humans need to perform the security tests they’re the most effective at 
carrying out, with their efforts augmented by automated testing.

A full spectrum of application security testing is an essential component of managing software risk in today’s world. When an 
organization lacks the needed human resources or tools to perform high\-level opaque/semi\-opaque box security testing such as 
penetration testing, or needs to vet its own software security controls, working with a third party such as Synopsys may be the 
best solution.

Vulnerabilities and Security Issues
Of the 3,900 tests, 97% uncovered some form of vulnerability in the targets. Thirty percent of the total were high\-risk 
vulnerabilities, and 6% were critical\-risk vulnerabilities. The easy availability of automated exploitation tools makes fixing high\- 
and critical\-risk vulnerabilities urgent whenever discovered.

High\-risk vulnerabilities such as cross\-site scripting (XSS) are issues that could allow attackers to access application resources 
and data. Twenty\-eight percent of the test targets had exposure to reflected, stored, or DOM\-based cross\-site scripting 
vulnerabilities. 

Critical\-risk vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute code on a web application or application server and access sensitive data. 
Common critical\-risk vulnerabilities include remote code execution and SQL injection—insertion of a SQL query via the input data 
from the client to the application. Three percent of the total test targets were vulnerable to some type of SQL injection.

exploitation tools makes fixing

Table 1: Top High\-Risk Vulnerabilities Found

Table 2: Top Critical\-Risk Vulnerabilities Found

Vulnerabilities Breakdown by the 2021 OWASP Top 10 
The Open Web Application Security Project (better known as OWASP) Top 10 list represents a consensus among a large 
sampling of developers and web application security teams on the most critical security risks to web applications. In late 2021, 
the Top 10 list was updated for the first time since 2017, with three new categories added and others consolidated or with name 
and scope changes. 

While intended by OWASP as an awareness document, many organizations use the list as a de facto application security 
standard. It’s interesting to see how the tests conducted by Synopsys correlate with the OWASP Top 10\. 

Of the total 28,501 vulnerabilities discovered in the tests, 21,810—76%—fell into a 2021 OWASP Top 10 category. Table 3 lists 
the 10 most prevalent vulnerabilities Synopsys found, matched against five of the OWASP Top 10 categories. If the list had been 
extended further, all 10 of the OWASP categories would have been represented. For example, Vulnerable Third\-Party Libraries 
in Use, which was found in 18% of the pen tests, correlates with the 2021 OWASP Top 10 category A06:2021—Vulnerable and 
Outdated Components.

Table 3: Vulnerabilities Matched Against 2021 OWASP Top 10 Categories 

A01:2021—Broken Access Control

Nineteen percent of the total vulnerabilities were related to the OWASP A01:2021—Broken Access Control category, which moved 
from the fifth to first listing in the 2021 OWASP Top 10\. The OWASP team noted more occurrences of vulnerabilities that fit into 
this category in the applications tested than any other category. Notable CWEs included in this category are CWE\-200: Exposure 
of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, CWE\-201: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Sent Data, and CWE\-
352: Cross\-Site Request Forgery.

Many of the vulnerabilities contained 
in the Broken Access Control 
category cannot be easily detected by 
automated testing tools.

It’s worth noting that many of the vulnerabilities contained in the Broken Access Control category are more failures in business 
logic than actual vulnerability types, and they cannot be easily detected by automated testing tools. For example, IDOR issues, 
which allow attackers to manipulate references in order to gain access to unauthorized data, are included in this group. As 
mentioned previously, the only effective way to detect IDOR issues is by having a human perform a manual test.

Of the total 28,501 vulnerabilities discovered in the tests, 
21,810—76%—fell into an OWASP Top 10 category.

 \| synopsys.com \| 6

 
A02:2021—Cryptographic Failures 

Eight percent of the total vulnerabilities uncovered in the tests related to the second category in the new OWASP Top 10, 
A02:2021—Cryptographic Failures, previously known as Sensitive Data Exposure. 

This renamed category has moved up one position, from third to second, in the 2021 OWASP Top 10\. The OWASP team 
describes the category as “more of a broad symptom than a root cause,” as these vulnerabilities focus on failures related to 
cryptography, which can often lead to exposure of sensitive data. Notable CWEs included in this category are CWE\-259: Use of 
Hard\-Coded Password, CWE\-327: Broken or Risky Crypto Algorithm, and CWE\-331: Insufficient Entropy.

When combined in the OWASP A05:2021—
Security Misconfiguration category, 
application and server misconfigurations 
represented 21% of the overall vulnerabilities.

A03:2021—Injection

The A03:2021—Injection category, now third in the 2021 OWASP Top 10, includes well\-known vulnerabilities such as CWE\-79: 
Cross\-Site Scripting, CWE\-89: SQL Injection, and CWE\-73: External Control of File Name or Path. Seven percent of the total 
vulnerabilities found in the tests fell into this category.

A05:2021—Security Misconfiguration

When combined in the OWASP A05:2021—Security Misconfiguration category, application and server misconfigurations 
represented 21% of the overall vulnerabilities found in the tests. The OWASP team notes, “with more shifts into highly 
configurable software, it’s not surprising to see this category move up” from sixth to fifth position in the OWASP Top 10\. Notable 
CWEs included in this category are CWE\-16 Configuration and CWE\-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference.

A07:2021—Identification and Authentication Failures

Previously known as Broken Authentication, the A07:2021—Identification and Authentication Failures category slid to seventh 
position in the OWASP Top 10 and now includes CWEs related to identification failures. 

Twenty\-one percent of the total vulnerabilities found in the tests belonged to this category, including what is identified in the 
tests as “fingerprinting,” a security measure sometimes used to authenticate users. However, unless web servers are properly 
configured and monitored, fingerprinting can also provide attackers with valuable information such as OS type, OS version, 
SNMP information, domain names, network blocks, VPN points, and more.

Types of Tests 
Sixty\-seven percent of the tests performed were penetration 
tests—simulated attacks designed to evaluate the security of 
an application or system. Pen testing enables organizations 
to find and fix runtime vulnerabilities in the final development 
stages of software or after its deployment. Pen tests are often 
a compliance requirement of security standards. For example, 
the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) 
requires penetration testing on a regular schedule or after any 
significant changes to the software or system.

Dynamic application security testing (DAST) and mobile application–specific tests comprised 16% and 12% of the total tests 
respectively. DAST is used to identify common coding weaknesses such as vulnerability to SQL injection, cross\-site scripting, 
security misconfigurations, and other common issues detailed in the OWASP Top 10 and the CWE/SANS Top 25\. 

Synopsys DAST assessments 
include manual testing to 
uncover vulnerabilities that 
typically can’t be found by 
out\-of\-the\-box tools.

Synopsys DAST assessments include manual testing to uncover vulnerabilities that typically can’t be found by out\-of\-the\-box 
tools, such as some vulnerabilities pertaining to authentication and session management, access control, and information 
leakage.

Mobile application security testing (MAST) is used to uncover authentication and authorization issues, client\-side trust issues, 
misconfigured security controls, cross\-platform development framework issues, and vulnerabilities in application binaries 
running on the mobile device and corresponding server\-side functionality.

Although not as well\-publicized as its overall Top 10 list, OWASP also publishes a mobile risks list, last updated in 2016\. Table 7 
matches the mobile test findings against the OWASP Top 10 Mobile Risks list of 2016\. Two of the vulnerability categories listed 
are server\-side issues, and they are shown with the comparable 2021 OWASP Top 10 list categories.

Insecure Data Storage

Twenty\-four percent of the discovered vulnerabilities in the mobile tests were related to OWASP M2: 
Insecure Data Storage. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain access to a mobile device 
either physically (i.e., accessing a stolen device) or through malware. 

Insecure Communications

Fifty\-three percent of the mobile tests uncovered vulnerabilities associated with insecure 
communications. General best practices include using certificates signed by a trusted provider and 
ensuring that application transport security is enabled for iOS devices.

Code Tampering 

A lack of binary protection can result in a mobile app that can be quickly analyzed, reverse\-engineered, 
and modified by an adversary. This vulnerability was found in 30% of the mobile tests. Other 
vulnerabilities falling into this category include No Jailbreak Detection, Jailbreak Detection Bypass, and 
No Root Detection.

Server Security Misconfigurations and Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

Verbose server banners—found in 14% of the mobile tests—provide information such as server name, 
type, and version number; this information could allow attackers to perform targeted attacks on specific 
technology stacks. The Security Logging and Monitoring Failures category encompasses insufficient 
logging, detection, and monitoring. Issues related to this category were found in 15% of the tests.

Testing with a Full Spectrum of Security Tools

As noted earlier in this report, many organizations use third\-party application security testing services to validate their own 
testing, ensure that their internal security controls are working, comply with regulatory or business requirements that mandate a 
third\-party assessment, or extend their own software security activities without having to add more staff or new tools.

The findings detailed in Table 8 indicate that the majority of development teams had probably conducted their own transparent 
box security testing—such as static analysis—earlier in the software development life cycle and addressed many vulnerabilities 
before having Synopsys examine the running applications/systems with dynamic analysis, mobile, and penetration tests. It’s 
also clear from the results that the best approach to security testing is to use a spectrum of the tools available to help ensure an 
application or system is secure. 

For example, 28% of total test targets had some exposure to a cross\-site scripting attack, one of the most prevalent and 
destructive high\-/critical\-risk vulnerabilities impacting web applications. While SAST testing can detect many common 
vulnerabilities, it is limited to discovering vulnerabilities that occur in the code itself. Many XSS vulnerabilities occur only when the 
application is running. 

Even Lower\-Risk Vulnerabilities Can Be Exploited to Facilitate Attacks

Sixty\-four percent of the vulnerabilities the tests discovered are considered minimal\-, low\-, or medium\-risk. That is, the issues 
found are not directly exploitable by attackers to gain access to systems or sensitive data. Nonetheless, surfacing these 
vulnerabilities is not an empty exercise, as even lower\-risk vulnerabilities can be exploited to facilitate attacks. For example, 
verbose server banners—found in 49% of the tests—provide information such as server name, type, and version number that 
could allow attackers to perform targeted attacks on specific technology stacks.

The prevalence of cross\-site scripting, 
clickjacking, and cross\-site leak exploits 
makes a strong argument for having a secure 
content security policy to protect against 
various types of attacks, especially cross\-
site scripting.

Implementing or securing protections such as a content security policy (CSP) can provide an added layer of security that helps 
detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including cross\-site scripting and data injection attacks. An insecure or absent 
CSP—which was found (or, more accurately, not found) in 77% of the tests—may be considered a low\-risk concern. However, the 
prevalence of cross\-site scripting, clickjacking, and cross\-site leak exploits makes a strong argument for having a secure CSP as 
an effective second layer of protection against various types of attacks, especially cross\-site scripting.

An Urgent Need for a Software Bill of Materials

As shown in Tables 5 and 6, the pen and dynamic analysis tests found essentially the same types of vulnerabilities, with some 
variation in percentages found. However, of note is the number of Vulnerable Third\-Party Libraries in Use, found in 18% of the 
pen tests. Although not detailed in this report, the same vulnerability was found in 33% of the static analysis tests Synopsys 
application testing services conducted in 2020\.

Highlight from Table 5: Top Vulnerabilities Found in Pen Tests

 \| synopsys.com \| 11

 
The vulnerability description correlates with the 2021 OWASP Top 10 category A06:2021—Vulnerable and Outdated Components. 
As OWASP notes, your software is likely vulnerable if

• You do not know the versions of all components you use (both client\-side and server\-side). This includes components you 

directly use as well as nested dependencies.

• The code being used is unsupported or out\-of\-date. This includes the OS, web/application server, database management 

system, applications, APIs, and all components, runtime environments, and libraries.

As the old security saw goes, “you can’t fix problems you don’t know you have.” Most organizations typically use a mix of custom\-
built code, commercial off\-the\-shelf code, and open source components to create the software they sell or use internally. Often 
those organizations have informal—or no—inventories detailing exactly what components their software is using, as well as 
those components’ licenses, versions, and patch status. With many companies having hundreds of applications or software 
systems in use, each themselves likely having hundreds to thousands of different third\-party and open source components, an 
accurate, up\-to\-date software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is urgently needed to effectively track those components.

The concept of SBOM comes from manufacturing, where the classic BOM is an inventory detailing the items included in a 
product. When a defective part is discovered, the manufacturer knows precisely what product is affected and can begin the 
process of repair or replacement. 

61%

increase

BSIMM12 data indicates a 61% 
increase in the “identify open source” 
activity over the past two years, due 
to the prevalence of open source 
components in modern software.

Similarly, more and more organizations are working to maintain an accurate, up\-to\-date SBOM that includes an inventory of 
third\-party and open source components to ensure their code is high\-quality, compliant, and secure. For example, BSIMM12 
data indicates a 61% increase in the “identify open source” activity over the past two years, due to the prevalence of open source 
components in modern software and the rise of attacks using popular open projects as vectors.

And the demand for SBOMs continues to grow. In its 2020 Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing, Gartner predicted, 
“By 2024, the provision of a detailed, regularly updated software Bill of Materials by software vendors will be a non\-negotiable 
requirement for at least half of enterprise software buyers, up from less than 5% in 2019\.” 

And while the 2021 executive order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity is primarily directed at federal departments, 
agencies, and contractors, its requirement for third parties to provide government software purchasers with a comprehensive 
SBOM will likely have a broad impact across critical infrastructure sectors and related technology suppliers.
