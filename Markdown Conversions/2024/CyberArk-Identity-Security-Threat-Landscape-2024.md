## Executive Summary
Cyber debt builds with GenAI, rise of machine identities, third- and fourth-party risks.

CyberArk 2024 Identity Security Threat Landscape Report is a global survey of 2,400 security 
decision-makers across 18 countries that examines how cyberattacks impact identity. This year 
we ﬁnd that cyber debt continues to build with GenAI, rise of machine identities, and increasing 
third- and fourth-party risks.

We kick off this year’s ﬁndings with a metaphor: if innovation is water, a glass is ﬁne, a faucet is 
divine, but a ﬁrehose is a very bad time. We wax poetic not to torture you but to drive home the 
absolute tsunami of new identities, new environments and new attack methods that are pumme-
ling and muddying the threat landscape in 2024. 

Nearly half of organizations anticipate a threefold increase in the total number of identities, with 
machine identities squarely in the driver’s seat (but largely under-secured and over-privileged). 
This growth in vulnerable identities, boosted by the ongoing AI transformation and pervasive 
cloud computing, is a here-and-now threat ready to be exploited by bad actors with the AI-powe-
red ability to execute at scale.

Of course, this is nobody’s ﬁrst rodeo with Generative AI. Nearly all surveyed organizations (and 
their adversaries) are using it. What is new is the rise in the volume of identity-related attacks, the 
increasing sophistication of election-year deepfakes — and a disturbing conﬁdence among C-level 
leaders that their employees can identify realistic fake video or audio of their leaders. Our report 
also uncovered a lack of rigorous focus on vendor risk management, despite the growing web of 
our digital ecosystems. Third- and fourth-party breaches can easily cascade to your organization, 
creating a multiplier effect on risk. 

Under a deluge of digital transformation, AI and identity-related attacks, it’s tempting to adopt 
that shiny new tech to solve a unique use case or simply for fear of missing out on the market buzz 
— and incur hefty cyber debt. But with eyes on that shiny new tech, beware of the blind spot: phi-
shing and vishing attacks. While far less interesting, these tried-and-true attack methods remain 
highly effective and lead to breaches and signiﬁcant ﬁnancial loss for 9 out of 10 organizations.

In the last 12 months, 93% of organizations suffered two or more identity-related 
breaches. 

In the last 12 months, 93% of organizations suffered two or more identity-related 
breaches. And, with 94% of our respondents using more than 10 vendors for iden-
tity-related cybersecurity initiatives, organizations ﬁnd themselves tangled in a ﬁshing 
line of multiple systems, applications, and services across different platforms and 
locations. While the attack vector is vast-bordering-on-dystopian, the slow and steady 
consolidation of trust (consolidation of tools with experienced, expert, innovative and 
trusted partners) could very well win this race.

Finally, we believe the imperative to establish a robust cybersecurity posture starts 
with securing every identity across the IT environment. Getting there requires a new 
cybersecurity model centered on identity security. Siloed, legacy solutions were built 
to solve yesterday's problems. The future of security starts with identity.

## GenAI: Promise, Potential – And Peril
We begin our 2024 Threat Landscape report with the technology we hate to love and love to 
hate: Generative AI. Wherever you stand on it — friend, foe or the future — two trends are 
undeniable. First, AI-powered tools aren't going away (surprise, surprise). Much like our 2023 
ﬁndings, nearly all of our 2024 respondents (99%) are leveraging GenAI in their 
identity-related cybersecurity initiatives. Unfortunately, so are the bad guys. 

We predict an unparalleled increase in the volume and sophistication of identity-related 
attacks as skilled and unskilled bad actors leverage GenAI to intensify their assaults. In the 
last 12 months, 9 of 10 organizations were victims of a breach due to a phishing/vishing 
attack. These types of attacks will be harder to detect as AI will automate and personalize 
the attack process. Looking to the year ahead, organizations can expect to be affected by 
data leakage from compromised AI models, AI-powered malware, and phishing. And, with 
GenAI, even previously unaffected organizations will ﬁnd themselves in the crosshairs — and 
will have to do damage control. 

This year, another up-and-comer joins the pain party: deepfakes. Perhaps the only thing more 
disturbing than the emergence of deepfake videos is our collective overconﬁdence that we 
won't be fooled by them. Nearly three-quarters of organizations are conﬁdent that their 
employees can identify B2B deepfake videos. More on that in a moment.

1. Digital transformation (22%)
2. Vulnerable IAM infrastructure (21%)
3. Volume & sophistication of cyberattacks (20%)

This year, we ﬁnd the top three reasons causing identity-related attacks are:

### Buckle up and Brace for Impact
Our respondents are bracing for a myriad of incoming GenAI-enabled threats, 
particularly deepfakes that will spawn an increasing number of successful 
phishing and/or vishing attacks.

Although we can all agree that GenAI is still in its 
infancy, it should not be a surprise if this technology 
powers the world’s most sophisticated at-scale 
attacks. In fact, researchers at CyberArk Labs were 
one of the ﬁrst in the market to sound the alarm that 
GenAI could create highly evasive malware capable 
of slipping undetected past most anti-malware 
security products.

Get ready for a pivotal and unsettling Decision 2024 
as over 4 billion voters prepare to elect leaders in 
over 60 countries — and AI-powered deepfake 
campaigns become the weapon of choice for anyone 
wanting to inﬂuence election outcomes. 

#### What we asked:
What negative impacts, if any, do you expect from AI 
tools in the next year?

#### What we learned:
93% of organizations expect AI-related cybersecurity 
challenges, with malware and phishing topping the list.

- 40% We don’t expect to experience any negative impacts
- 40% AI-powered malware
- 39% AI-powered phishing
- 38% Data leakage from compromised AI models
- 34% AI-powered dataset poisoning/adversarial effect
- 33% Deepfake scams
- 7% AI-generated code

_93% expect a negative impact from AI-powered tools in the next 12 months._

### Overconﬁdence: The Mother of All Biases
We know that AI-driven phishing and deepfake scams are already working. 
Our research further tells us we will see a steep rise in GenAI-powered 
cyberattacks. So why do over 75% of respondents say they’re conﬁdent their 
employees can identify deepfake videos or audio of their leaders?

Our persona-level insights paint an interesting picture. We ﬁnd that C-level 
executives are entirely conﬁdent that their employees can identify these 
deepfakes compared to other cybersecurity leaders and practitioners 
surveyed in this report. 

Because the impact of deepfakes is both imminent and unquantiﬁed, we 
decided to pose the same question to over 4,000 US-based employees in our 
2024 US Ofﬁce Worker Survey. We found a similar pattern: employees are 
largely conﬁdent in their ability to identify a deepfake video or audio of the 
leaders in their organization. 

Whether we chalk it up to the illusion of control, planning fallacy, or just plain 
human optimism, this level of systemic conﬁdence is misguided. The full 
destructive potential of GenAI remains unknown, and we may not quite grasp 
how vulnerable we are.

#### What we asked:
How conﬁdent are you that your employees can correctly 
identify the following deepfakes?

#### What we learned:
Compared to other cybersecurity leaders and practitioners, a 
majority (nearly 75%) of executives are completely conﬁdent 
that employees can spot deepfakes of their leaders.

- A video recording showing your CEO exchanging cash with criminals
  - Cybersecurity C-level executives: 39%
  - Other Cybersecurity practitioners: 28%
  - US worker survey: 34%
- An audio recording featuring your CFO/Finance Director giving ﬁnancial forecast
  - Cybersecurity C-level executives: 37%
  - Other Cybersecurity practitioners: 25%
  - US worker survey: 28%
- A video showing your HR Director requesting individuals update their payroll information
  - Cybersecurity C-level executives: 36%
  - Other Cybersecurity practitioners: 28%
  - US worker survey: 31%
- A video from your IT Director giving IT training that encourages bad cybersecurity practices
  - Cybersecurity C-level executives: 36%
  - Other Cybersecurity practitioners: 26%
  - US worker survey: 31%
- A webinar recording featuring your sales lead pointing out ﬂaws/deﬁciencies in your own products
  - Cybersecurity C-level executives: 34%
  - Other Cybersecurity practitioners: 26%
  - US worker survey: 29%

_Get ready for a pivotal and unsettling Decision 2024 as over 4 billion voters 
prepare to elect leaders in over 60 countries — and AI-powered deepfake 
campaigns become the weapon of choice for anyone wanting to inﬂuence 
election outcomes._

“Don’t worry, it’s me: President Biden.”

In January 2024, several New Hampshire-based voters in the United States 
received a robocall seemingly from President Joe Biden urging them not to 
vote in the primary elections. Ofﬁcials were able to identify and stop this 
social engineering tactic from having a material impact on the primary 
elections. However, we can safely assume that not every case will be this 
lucky. Individual voters are small fry compared to the big bounty nefarious 
actors can score in B2B environments. In February, a Hong Kong-based 
multinational company lost HK $200 million (US $25.6 million) to a deepfake 
scam that fooled a clerk into executing a ﬁnancial transaction discussed 
during a virtual meeting where every attendee — even the chief ﬁnancial 
ofﬁcer (CFO) — was fake. Unfortunately, this ﬁrst-of-its-kind AI heist (and 
worst day ever for an employee) will not be the last. AI-powered phishing 
attacks will soon target and potentially breach 100% of organizations.

### Are You Smarter Than a Deepfake?
The truth is, GenAI tools will produce increasingly realistic deepfake videos 
that will be hard for employees to identify and harder for cybersecurity teams 
to get in front of. Until we have tools sophisticated enough to detect and 
prevent deepfake scams, CISOs must focus on educating and building 
awareness with support and services teams on the frontlines of incoming 
technical help calls and emails.

### CyberArk Insights
The rapid adoption of GenAI harkens back to another global phenomenon with 
a similar path of destruction: unregulated social media. To that end, we see 
signiﬁcant urgency from governments around the world, eager to not repeat 
the same mistakes with GenAI. 

In March 2023, the European Union passed the Artiﬁcial Intelligence Act, and 
eight months later, the United States issued an executive order 14110 or EO for 
Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artiﬁcial Intelligence. 
The message is clear: the responsibility for the safe usage of AI-powered tools 
lays squarely on the provider and users — with hefty penalties for misuse. 

The providers are responding in kind. OpenAI is delaying the release of Sora AI 
to ensure content provenance and to enable users to identify real vs. 
increasingly real-looking but fake videos. Deepfakes put us all at increasing 
risk of widespread mis- and disinformation, phishing and vishing attacks, 
breaches, data loss, regulatory ﬁnes, and reputational damage at scales 
previously unknown to us. 

### What This Means for You
A deepfake video emerges of your CEO exchanging cash with a known 
criminal. Will your employees know what they’re really seeing? It all depends 
on who you ask. According to our research, C-level executives have much more 
faith in their employees’ deepfake detection abilities than cybersecurity 
experts.

Our advice: Discuss this perception gap with stakeholders in your organization 
and identify why it might exist. Only when executives and cybersecurity teams 
are aligned can there be a path to resolution.

With 99% of organizations already adopting AI-powered tools in their 
identity-related cybersecurity initiatives, we urge you to consider scenarios 
where the AI that protects your organization is also under attack. Here are a 
few quick rules of thumb for introducing AI tools.

1.  Run It by Legal: 
It’s wise to include legal language in your contracts that lets you 
review their capabilities. This ensures the tool delivers exactly what it 
promised and meets your expectations.
2.  Handle (Data) With Care: 
Take a close look at what types of data the AI tool accesses and 
retains. Think about how you can isolate and segregate tools to prevent 
any data tampering or leakage – especially if the data models get 
compromised.
3.  Awareness is Everything: 
Don’t cut corners on cybersecurity training for your service and support 
teams. They hold the front lines with customers and, potentially, bad 
actors.

## New Era: Rise of the Machines
By now, organizations understand that any human identity with access to sensitive data is a 
privileged user. But what about the non-human (machine) identities? Not to get too dystopian, but 
the classic human tendency to underestimate machines leads to our Bladerunner-esque downfall. 
Similarly, in a B2B setting underestimating machines contributes to cybersecurity risk - making 
them the most dangerous identities of all.

Over the next 12 months, we predict the number of identities to more than double (2.4x), following 
the same pattern we saw in 2023. However, nearly half of this year’s respondents expect an 
increase of three times or more in 2024 — a 24% increase from last year.

|       | 2023 | 2024 |
| :---- | :--- | :--- |
| Increase by 2x or less | 56% | 46% |
| Increase by 3x or less | 38% | 38% |
| Remain ﬂat | 6% | 5% |

_47%_

#### What we asked:
Over the next 12 months, how 
much do you expect the total 
number of human and machine 
identities within your 
organization to increase?

#### What we learned:
Nearly 50% expect the total 
number to grow by 3x or more.

### Sci-Fi: Don’t Overlook the Machines
The growth of the total number of identities is neither new nor surprising. What is surprising 
is that nearly two-thirds of the organizations we surveyed have a very narrow deﬁnition of 
‘privileged user’. Access is power, and machine identities have more than we realize.

The security controls we implement in our IT environments are only as good as the risks we 
deﬁne. With 9 out of 10 organizations naming phishing and vishing as the number one reason 
for an identity-related breach, we naturally focus all our security resources on the weakest 
link: human identities. However, according to our research, machine identities are the primary 
driving force behind the exponential growth of the total number of identities. Humans are 
only one corner of a million-piece puzzle. Afterall, it won’t be long before chatbots or virtual 
assistants will be phished. 

_In 61% of organizations, the deﬁnition of a ‘privileged 
user’ applies solely to human identities._

1.  30% Increase in third-party relationships
2.  27% Machine identities
3.  26% Growth of overall business

#### What we asked:
What is driving the increase in the number of identities under 
management at your organization?

#### What we learned:
Machine identities are the #1 driver for overall identity 
growth.

### Repeat After Me: Machines Are Privileged Users Too
Nearly three-quarters (68%) of respondents indicate that up to 
50% of all machine identities have access to sensitive data, 
compared to 64% who report that about half of human identities 
have access to sensitive data. With an increasing number of 
machine identities gaining access to sensitive data, 49% of our 
respondents identify them as the riskiest identity type. 

And because of the lack of focus on securing machine identities, 
organizations report that their next biggest concern is a machine 
identity-related security incident that would require signiﬁcant 
manual effort to address or remediate.

### Manage Your Non-Humans Here
You need to secure risky, unknown and unmanaged machine 
identities. Where exactly should you start? 

According to our respondents, the risk landscape has shifted 
away from business-critical applications (2023) to DevOps, CI/CD 
pipelines and development environments — followed by user 
machines and service accounts used by applications. 

|                                                              | 2023 | 2024 |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--- | :--- |
| DevOps, CI/CD pipelines or other development environments  | 38%  | 30%  |
| User machines (e.g. desktops, laptops, mobile devices)       | 30%  | 27%  |
| Service accounts used by applications for non-interactive processes | 27%  | 34%  |
| Cloud infrastructure and workloads                           | 26%  | 30%  |
| Accounts with access to servers in OT environments           | 24%  | 26%  |
| Business critical apps, ERP, CRM or ﬁnancial mgt software    | 38%  | 22%  |
| Mission critical servers, for example domain controllers      | 32%  | 26%  |
| IaaS provider root/registration accounts                     | 31%  | 24%  |
| IoT devices                                                 | 31%  | 28%  |
| Bots/Robotic Process Automation                              | 29%  | 27%  |

#### What we asked:
Where do the riskiest unknown, unmanaged identities live in 
your organization’s IT environment?

#### What we learned:
DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, user machines, and service accounts 
are perceived as leading attack vectors.

### CyberArk Insights 
The message is clear. Machine identities are on the rise, and they have access to your sensitive 
data. With GenAI, machine identities will proliferate at a much faster pace in the near future. Your 
organization must reassess its deﬁnition of a privileged user to ensure every identity is secured. 
And (one more time for those in the back) this includes machine identities.

### What This Means for You
Once you deﬁne both human and machine identities as privileged users, it’s important to assess 
every user machine, service account and workload to apply security controls where they were 
previously limited or missing due to an overly narrow deﬁnition. 

It’s been said a thousand times, but we’ll say it again for good measure: Developers and 
engineering teams must involve corporate cybersecurity teams from day one of their projects. 
Both parties need to agree on how to strike a balance between productivity and security. 

If you lack visibility of secrets within your environment, consider eliminating (or at last reducing) 
multiple vaults and secrets sprawl.

#### What we asked:
What are your organization’s top concerns when securing machine 
identities (e.g., applications, cloud workloads, RPA)?

#### What we learned:
Security concerns are slowing down automation. Also, the threat of a 
machine identity-related security incidents could cause signiﬁcant 
manual effort to remediate.

- 25% Security concerns are slowing down our RPA and automation tool deployments.
- 24% A machine identity security incident would require signiﬁcant manual effort to address.
- 24% Security unable to match the pace development of new apps and rise of machine identities.
- 22% Unclear if we have adequately secured our organizations software supply chain.
- 22% Reducing the cyber debt of machine identities that have unsecured secrets and credentials.
- 21% We are mostly focused on securing human identities.
- 20% Our developers typically have more privileges than strictly necessary.
- 20% Security lacks visibility to secrets across the organization.
- 19% Multiple vaults and secrets sprawled across the organization.

## Chain Reaction: Third- and Fourth-party Risks
If you’re already concerned about the state of cybersecurity at your third-party 
vendors, have you considered losing additional sleep over your partners’ partners? 

You’ve heard about third-party providers (product or service companies your 
organization engages with directly). Fourth parties contract with your third parties 
and typically provide products or services to support your organization’s digital 
business. Unfortunately, a compromise on one party leads to a compromise on all. 
Cry if you want to.

### Third And Fourth Parties: Riskier Than Your Actual Extended Family
The growing constellation of business relationships can stretch an organization’s 
reach, expertise, and budget. But every additional “nth” provider you bring into your 
digital ecosystem exponentially increases your risk. Our survey found that (84%) of 
organizations expect to leverage three or more cloud service providers (CSPs) in the 
next 12 months (on par with 85% last year). On the other hand, our 2024 
respondents expect the number of Software as a Service (SaaS) providers to 
increase by 89% in the next 12 months, compared to 67% in the 2023 report. 

Now, remember that your extended family indeed extends beyond CSPs and SaaS 
providers. Your third-party providers include your service providers, integrators, 
hardware and infrastructure suppliers, business partners, distributors, resellers, 
telecommunications and many others that are external to the organization that 
enable your digital business. Do you have visibility across all your third-party 
providers’ security practices? How about your fourth-party providers?

_In the next 12 months, 84% organizations will use 3 or more CSPs and number of SaaS applications will grow 89%._

#### What we asked:
What are your top two cloud security concerns? 
(Select two)

#### What we learned:
All organizations have cloud security concerns.

- 24% Data/ privacy protection
- 23% Password/secrets leakage
- 23% IoT security and access
- 23% Software vulnerabilities
- 22% Remote work environments
- 22% Threat detection and remediation
- 21% Malicious actors
- 21% Ransomware
- 21% Regulatory compliance
- 21% Denial of service
- 20% Misconﬁguration
- 20% Over-provisioned/issued access
- 19% Provisioning errors
- 19% Data theft

### A High-Stakes Trust Fall
The risks of a digital ecosystem are many — some severe and some minor. But overall, 
digital transformation continues to be the leading cause of an identity-related attack. 

Our 2024 respondents indicate their multi-cloud environment currently consists of an 
average of 3 CSPs. Their key cloud security concerns are the following:

1.  Data theft (24%)
2.  Data/privacy protection (23%)
3.  Password/secret leakage (23%)
4.  IoT security and access (23%)
5.  Software vulnerabilities (22%)

### BOGO for Bad Guys 
Some grim hypotheticals: Let’s say one or more of your third-party providers were 
targeted and breached. They should notify you about the extent of the damage and its 
implications. But what happens to you if attackers inﬁltrate your fourth-party provider 
and impact your third party? Would you know the extent of the fallout on your 
organization? If you manage a multi-tenant environment, a bad actor needs to attack 
only one provider to gain access to multiple customer environments. 

|                               | Breached due to software supply chain attack | Breached due to third-party identity theft |

_80% of organizations experienced an identity-related breach due to a software supply chain attack._

#### What we asked:
How often has your organization 
faced a successful identity-related 
breach due to a software supply 
chain attack in the last 12 months?

#### What we learned:
Majority of organizations have 
suffered from a supply chain attack 
and third-party identity theft.

### Open Season on Sitting Ducks
Not so long ago, the industry experienced its ﬁrst double software supply chain attack on 3CX 
that impacted over 600,000 customers. Fast forward to today, and we see hackers optimizing 
their efforts and maximizing potential ﬁnancial gains with sophisticated AI-powered cyberattacks. 
Our 2024 ﬁndings indicate that 80% of organizations experienced an identity-related breach due 
to a supply chain attack, and 57% of these breached organizations reported that external bad 
actors were responsible. 

We are seeing a rising number of individuals, groups and nation-states actively targeting 
technology-critical infrastructure providers. In April 2024, hackers accessed hard-coded secrets 
in the GitLab repositories of Sisense, a business intelligence company. The subsequent breach of 
sensitive customer data prompted the leading US-based Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA) to issue alerts for customers to reset any shared credentials and secrets 
immediately. 

Some bad actors want to inﬂuence election outcomes, some are in it purely for ﬁnancial gain, and 
others, well, they just want your emails. Earlier this year, nation-state-led bad actors spied on 
executives’ emails at both Microsoft and HPE. Experts are still evaluating the extent of the 
impact. As more and more incendiaries pile into the tinderbox of a global election year, seismic 
breaches like SolarWinds could be just the starter kit.

|           | 2023 | 2024 |
| :-------- | :--- | :--- |
| 10 or less | 5%   | 11%  |
| More than 10 | 1%   | 1%   |
| Don't know | 94%  | 89%  |

#### What we asked:
On average, how many 
identity-related vendors has 
your organization onboarded 
to date?

#### What we learned:
Organizations are using more 
than 10 identity-related 
vendors compared to 2023.

### Uniﬁed Visibility is a Big Blind Spot
A digital ecosystem is often made up of disparate tools that address unique requirements 
across on-premises, hybrid and multi-cloud environments. This applies to your cybersecurity 
technology stack too, including your identity portfolio. In fact, 26% of respondents chose “lack 
of visibility across multiple identity-related point tools, products and services” as the top two 
truest statements for their organizations. Lack of visibility across disparate (on-premises and 
cloud) environments was a close third.This lack of visibility extends deep into the digital 
ecosystem where risk from third- and fourth-party providers are hard to evaluate regularly. It 
bears repeating that vendor risk evaluation is usually the last priority in post-breach 
investments. This needs to change.

Granted, this may be a long-term project. But we believe the light at the end of this particular 
tunnel is well worth the effort.

### What This Means for You
Again, consolidating your vendor stack and deprecating those legacy tools is not an easy task. 
But there are few ways to make the process less painful.

Start with a simple question: What does “trusted third party” really mean? When qualifying a 
vendor, get a consensus with your stakeholders on why and how to stack and rank their 
experience, expertise, track record for innovation, and customer service capabilities. Look at 
analyst and earnings reports, market assessments and consider word-of-mouth 
recommendations. And while the shiniest and most talked-about product or service might be 
tempting, sometimes the less glamorous tools are the best ﬁt for your unique environment.

### CyberArk Insights 
Digital business is a tangled web of ever-expanding partners and providers, each eager to 
adopt new technologies but often unable to divest from legacy environments. For identity 
security professionals, too many tools for too many use cases are the bane of their existence. 
Research tells us that 94% of organizations leverage more than 10 vendors for their 
identity-related cybersecurity initiatives — up from 89% last year. If this is true for you, allow us 
to gently nag:

1.  Audit and evaluate all legacy and new technologies across your environment.
2.  Assess the risks of these disparate tools address vs. the time and effort required to maintain them.
3.  Create a plan to consolidate your technology stack based on the right balance for your organization. Do this slowly but surely.

## Cyber Debt: “Shiny Object” Syndrome and a Blind Spot
Shiny Object Syndrome: we’ve all had it. After all, new technologies are attractive, exciting and 
capture our imaginations — and often a chunk of our organizational time and money (lookin’ at 
you, GenAI). But as we focus on adopting and implementing transformational technologies and 
addressing the Threats of the Future, cybersecurity teams cannot — even for a moment — 
afford to take their eyes off the prize of the existing and age-old threat landscape. This is a 
recipe for disaster.

### The More Things Change, the More They Stay Insane
Digital transformation continues to be the top cause of identity-related attacks. Breaches due 
to phishing and vishing attacks have impacted 9 of 10 organizations. Nearly the same number 
of organizations were targeted by ransomware in 2024 (90%) as compared to 2023 (89%) with 
a higher number of organizations reporting damage (irretrievable loss of data).

_90% were targeted by ransomware and 75% paid ransom but did not recover the data._

#### What we asked:
Which two factors are most likely to cause an identity-related 
attack in your organization?

#### What we learned:
Digital transformation fueled by cloud adoption is the #1 reason to 
likely cause an identity-related attack.

- 22% Digital transformation initiatives (e.g. cloud adoption, porting legacy apps, etc.)
- 17% A vulnerable IAM (Identity Access Management) infrastructure
- 21% Volume and sophistication of cyberattacks
- 17% Geopolitical unrest and/or state-sponsored cyberattacks
- 20% Usage of third-parties or external vendors
- 17% Growing number of applications (SaaS & on-premise)
- 19% Remote & hybrid working practices
- 14% Stolen or leaked credentials
- 19% Lack of visibility of the complete identity journey
- 18% Economic uncertainty and potential slowdown
- 17% Digital transformation initiatives (e.g. cloud adoption, portinRapid adoption of GenAIg legacy apps, etc.)

1.  Supply chain attack uses third-party tools or services (collectively referred to as a “supply 
chain”) to inﬁltrate a target's system or network. These attacks via your digital ecosystem 
are sometimes called "value-chain attacks" or "third-party attacks."
2.  Application vulnerability is a system ﬂaw or weakness in an application's code that can be 
exploited by a malicious actor, potentially leading to a security breach. Organizations 
must patch critically vulnerable software and systems across their digital footprint. Attac-
kers will actively target those who have not yet applied the patch.

#### What we asked:
How often has your organization 
faced a successful identity-related 
breach in the last 12 months?

#### What we learned:
Phishing and vishing attacks 
impacted 9 out of 10 organizations 
we spoke to.
