Executive Summary

CyberArk 2024 Identity Security Threat Landscape Report is a global survey of 2,400 security 
decision\-makers across 18 countries that examines how cyberattacks impact identity. This year 
we ﬁnd that cyber debt continues to build with GenAI, rise of machine identities, and increasing 
third\- and fourth\-party risks.

We kick off this year’s ﬁndings with a metaphor: if innovation is water, a glass is ﬁne, a faucet is 
divine, but a ﬁrehose is a very bad time. We wax poetic not to torture you but to drive home the 
absolute tsunami of new identities, new environments and new attack methods that are pumme\-
ling and muddying the threat landscape in 2024\. 

Nearly half of organizations anticipate a threefold increase in the total number of identities, with 
machine identities squarely in the driver’s seat (but largely under\-secured and over\-privileged). 
This growth in vulnerable identities, boosted by the ongoing AI transformation and pervasive 
cloud computing, is a here\-and\-now threat ready to be exploited by bad actors with the AI\-powe\-
red ability to execute at scale.

Of course, this is nobody’s ﬁrst rodeo with Generative AI. Nearly all surveyed organizations (and 
their adversaries) are using it. What is new is the rise in the volume of identity\-related attacks, the 
increasing sophistication of election\-year deepfakes — and a disturbing conﬁdence among C\-level 
leaders that their employees can identify realistic fake video or audio of their leaders. Our report 
also uncovered a lack of rigorous focus on vendor risk management, despite the growing web of 
our digital ecosystems. Third\- and fourth\-party breaches can easily cascade to your organization, 
creating a multiplier effect on risk. 

Under a deluge of digital transformation, AI and identity\-related attacks, it’s tempting to adopt 
that shiny new tech to solve a unique use case or simply for fear of missing out on the market buzz 
— and incur hefty cyber debt. But with eyes on that shiny new tech, beware of the blind spot: phi\-
shing and vishing attacks. While far less interesting, these tried\-and\-true attack methods remain 
highly effective and lead to breaches and signiﬁcant ﬁnancial loss for 9 out of 10 organizations.

In the last 12 months, 93% 
of organizations suffered 
two or more identity\-related 
breaches. 

In the last 12 months, 93% of organizations suffered two or more identity\-related 
breaches. And, with 94% of our respondents using more than 10 vendors for iden\-
tity\-related cybersecurity initiatives, organizations ﬁnd themselves tangled in a ﬁshing 
line of multiple systems, applications, and services across different platforms and 
locations. While the attack vector is vast\-bordering\-on\-dystopian, the slow and steady 
consolidation of trust (consolidation of tools with experienced, expert, innovative and 
trusted partners) could very well win this race.

Finally, we believe the imperative to establish a robust cybersecurity posture starts 
with securing every identity across the IT environment. Getting there requires a new 
cybersecurity model centered on identity security. Siloed, legacy solutions were built 
to solve yesterday's problems. The future of security starts with identity.

GenAI: Promise, 
Potential – And Peril

We begin our 2024 Threat Landscape report with the technology we hate to love and love to 
hate: Generative AI. Wherever you stand on it — friend, foe or the future — two trends are 
undeniable. First, AI\-powered tools aren't going away (surprise, surprise). Much like our 2023 
ﬁndings, nearly all of our 2024 respondents (99%) are leveraging GenAI in their 
identity\-related cybersecurity initiatives. Unfortunately, so are the bad guys. 

We predict an unparalleled increase in the volume and sophistication of identity\-related 
attacks as skilled and unskilled bad actors leverage GenAI to intensify their assaults. In the 
last 12 months, 9 of 10 organizations were victims of a breach due to a phishing/vishing 
attack. These types of attacks will be harder to detect as AI will automate and personalize 
the attack process. Looking to the year ahead, organizations can expect to be affected by 
data leakage from compromised AI models, AI\-powered malware, and phishing. And, with 
GenAI, even previously unaffected organizations will ﬁnd themselves in the crosshairs — and 
will have to do damage control. 

This year, another up\-and\-comer joins the pain party: deepfakes. Perhaps the only thing more 
disturbing than the emergence of deepfake videos is our collective overconﬁdence that we 
won't be fooled by them. Nearly three\-quarters of organizations are conﬁdent that their 
employees can identify B2B deepfake videos. More on that in a moment.

93% expect a negative impact from 
AI\-powered tools in the next 12 months.

Buckle up and Brace for Impact

Our respondents are bracing for a myriad of incoming GenAI\-enabled threats, 
particularly deepfakes that will spawn an increasing number of successful 
phishing and/or vishing attacks.

This year, we ﬁnd the top three reasons causing 
identity\-related attacks are:

1

2

3

Digital transformation (22%)

Vulnerable IAM infrastructure (21%)

Volume \& sophistication of cyberattacks (20%)

Although we can all agree that GenAI is still in its 
infancy, it should not be a surprise if this technology 
powers the world’s most sophisticated at\-scale 
attacks. In fact, researchers at CyberArk Labs were 
one of the ﬁrst in the market to sound the alarm that 
GenAI could create highly evasive malware capable 
of slipping undetected past most anti\-malware 
security products.

Get ready for a pivotal and unsettling Decision 2024 
as over 4 billion voters prepare to elect leaders in 
over 60 countries — and AI\-powered deepfake 
campaigns become the weapon of choice for anyone 
wanting to inﬂuence election outcomes. 

What we asked:

tools in the next year?

GenAI: PROMISE, POTENTIAL – AND PER IL

Get ready for a pivotal and unsettling Decision 2024 as over 4 billion voters 
prepare to elect leaders in over 60 countries — and AI\-powered deepfake 
campaigns become the weapon of choice for anyone wanting to inﬂuence 
election outcomes.

“Don’t worry, it’s me: President Biden.”

In January 2024, several New Hampshire\-based voters in the United States 
received a robocall seemingly from President Joe Biden urging them not to 
vote in the primary elections. Ofﬁcials were able to identify and stop this 
social engineering tactic from having a material impact on the primary 
elections. However, we can safely assume that not every case will be this 
lucky. Individual voters are small fry compared to the big bounty nefarious 
actors can score in B2B environments. In February, a Hong Kong\-based 
multinational company lost HK $200 million (US $25\.6 million) to a deepfake 
scam that fooled a clerk into executing a ﬁnancial transaction discussed 
during a virtual meeting where every attendee — even the chief ﬁnancial 
ofﬁcer (CFO) — was fake. Unfortunately, this ﬁrst\-of\-its\-kind AI heist (and 
worst day ever for an employee) will not be the last. AI\-powered phishing 
attacks will soon target and potentially breach 100% of organizations.

Are You Smarter Than a Deepfake?

The truth is, GenAI tools will produce increasingly realistic deepfake videos 
that will be hard for employees to identify and harder for cybersecurity teams 
to get in front of. Until we have tools sophisticated enough to detect and 
prevent deepfake scams, CISOs must focus on educating and building 
awareness with support and services teams on the frontlines of incoming 
technical help calls and emails.

Overconﬁdence: The Mother of All Biases

We know that AI\-driven phishing and deepfake scams are already working. 
Our research further tells us we will see a steep rise in GenAI\-powered 
cyberattacks. So why do over 75% of respondents say they’re conﬁdent their 
employees can identify deepfake videos or audio of their leaders?

Our persona\-level insights paint an interesting picture. We ﬁnd that C\-level 
executives are entirely conﬁdent that their employees can identify these 
deepfakes compared to other cybersecurity leaders and practitioners 
surveyed in this report. 

Because the impact of deepfakes is both imminent and unquantiﬁed, we 
decided to pose the same question to over 4,000 US\-based employees in our 
2024 US Ofﬁce Worker Survey. We found a similar pattern: employees are 
largely conﬁdent in their ability to identify a deepfake video or audio of the 
leaders in their organization. 

Whether we chalk it up to the illusion of control, planning fallacy, or just plain 
human optimism, this level of systemic conﬁdence is misguided. The full 
destructive potential of GenAI remains unknown, and we may not quite grasp 
how vulnerable we are.

What This Means for You

The rapid adoption of GenAI harkens back to another global phenomenon with 
a similar path of destruction: unregulated social media. To that end, we see 
signiﬁcant urgency from governments around the world, eager to not repeat 
the same mistakes with GenAI. 

In March 2023, the European Union passed the Artiﬁcial Intelligence Act, and 
eight months later, the United States issued an executive order 14110 or EO for 
Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artiﬁcial Intelligence. 
The message is clear: the responsibility for the safe usage of AI\-powered tools 
lays squarely on the provider and users — with hefty penalties for misuse. 

The providers are responding in kind. OpenAI is delaying the release of Sora AI 
to ensure content provenance and to enable users to identify real vs. 
increasingly real\-looking but fake videos. Deepfakes put us all at increasing 
risk of widespread mis\- and disinformation, phishing and vishing attacks, 
breaches, data loss, regulatory ﬁnes, and reputational damage at scales 
previously unknown to us. 

A deepfake video emerges of your CEO exchanging cash with a known 
criminal. Will your employees know what they’re really seeing? It all depends 
on who you ask. According to our research, C\-level executives have much more 
faith in their employees’ deepfake detection abilities than cybersecurity 
experts.

Our advice: Discuss this perception gap with stakeholders in your organization 
and identify why it might exist. Only when executives and cybersecurity teams 
are aligned can there be a path to resolution.

With 99% of organizations already adopting AI\-powered tools in their 
identity\-related cybersecurity initiatives, we urge you to consider scenarios 
where the AI that protects your organization is also under attack. Here are a 
few quick rules of thumb for introducing AI tools.

1

2

3

Run It by Legal: 
It’s wise to include legal language in your contracts that lets you 
review their capabilities. This ensures the tool delivers exactly what it 
promised and meets your expectations.

Handle (Data) With Care: 
Take a close look at what types of data the AI tool accesses and 
retains. Think about how you can isolate and segregate tools to prevent 
any data tampering or leakage – especially if the data models get 
compromised.

Awareness is Everything: 
Don’t cut corners on cybersecurity training for your service and support 
teams. They hold the front lines with customers and, potentially, bad 
actors.

New Era: Rise 
of the Machines

By now, organizations understand that any human identity with access to sensitive data is a 
privileged user. But what about the non\-human (machine) identities? Not to get too dystopian, but 
the classic human tendency to underestimate machines leads to our Bladerunner\-esque downfall. 
Similarly, in a B2B setting underestimating machines contributes to cybersecurity risk \- making 
them the most dangerous identities of all.

Over the next 12 months, we predict the number of identities to more than double (2\.4x), following 
the same pattern we saw in 2023\. However, nearly half of this year’s respondents expect an 
increase of three times or more in 2024 — a 24% increase from last year.

What we asked:

Over the next 12 months, how 
much do you expect the total 
number of human and machine 
identities within your 
organization to increase?

Sci\-Fi: Don’t Overlook the Machines

The growth of the total number of identities is neither new nor surprising. What is surprising 
is that nearly two\-thirds of the organizations we surveyed have a very narrow deﬁnition of 
‘privileged user’. Access is power, and machine identities have more than we realize.

In 61% of organizations, the deﬁnition of a ‘privileged 
user’ applies solely to human identities.

The security controls we implement in our IT environments are only as good as the risks we 
deﬁne. With 9 out of 10 organizations naming phishing and vishing as the number one reason 
for an identity\-related breach, we naturally focus all our security resources on the weakest 
link: human identities. However, according to our research, machine identities are the primary 
driving force behind the exponential growth of the total number of identities. Humans are 
only one corner of a million\-piece puzzle. Afterall, it won’t be long before chatbots or virtual 
assistants will be phished.

NE W E RA: RISE OF THE MACHINES

Repeat After Me: Machines 
Are Privileged Users Too

Nearly three\-quarters (68%) of respondents indicate that up to 
50% of all machine identities have access to sensitive data, 
compared to 64% who report that about half of human identities 
have access to sensitive data. With an increasing number of 
machine identities gaining access to sensitive data, 49% of our 
respondents identify them as the riskiest identity type. 

And because of the lack of focus on securing machine identities, 
organizations report that their next biggest concern is a machine 
identity\-related security incident that would require signiﬁcant 
manual effort to address or remediate.

Manage Your Non\-Humans Here

You need to secure risky, unknown and unmanaged machine 
identities. Where exactly should you start? 

According to our respondents, the risk landscape has shifted 
away from business\-critical applications (2023\) to DevOps, CI/CD 
pipelines and development environments — followed by user 
machines and service accounts used by applications.

CyberArk Insights 

The message is clear. Machine identities are on the rise, and they have access to your sensitive 
data. With GenAI, machine identities will proliferate at a much faster pace in the near future. Your 
organization must reassess its deﬁnition of a privileged user to ensure every identity is secured. 
And (one more time for those in the back) this includes machine identities.

What This Means for You

Once you deﬁne both human and machine identities as privileged users, it’s important to assess 
every user machine, service account and workload to apply security controls where they were 
previously limited or missing due to an overly narrow deﬁnition. 

It’s been said a thousand times, but we’ll say it again for good measure: Developers and 
engineering teams must involve corporate cybersecurity teams from day one of their projects. 
Both parties need to agree on how to strike a balance between productivity and security. 

If you lack visibility of secrets within your environment, consider eliminating (or at last reducing) 
multiple vaults and secrets sprawl.

What we asked:

What are your organization’s top concerns when securing machine 
identities (e.g., applications, cloud workloads, RPA)?

What we learned:

CHAIN REACTION: THIRD AND FOUR TH\-PAR TY RISKS

Chain Reaction: Third
and Fourth\-party Risks

If you’re already concerned about the state of cybersecurity at your third\-party 
vendors, have you considered losing additional sleep over your partners’ partners? 

You’ve heard about third\-party providers (product or service companies your 
organization engages with directly). Fourth parties contract with your third parties 
and typically provide products or services to support your organization’s digital 
business. Unfortunately, a compromise on one party leads to a compromise on all. 
Cry if you want to.

Third And Fourth Parties: 
Riskier Than Your Actual Extended Family

The growing constellation of business relationships can stretch an organization’s 
reach, expertise, and budget. But every additional “nth” provider you bring into your 
digital ecosystem exponentially increases your risk. Our survey found that (84%) of 
organizations expect to leverage three or more cloud service providers (CSPs) in the 
next 12 months (on par with 85% last year). On the other hand, our 2024 
respondents expect the number of Software as a Service (SaaS) providers to 
increase by 89% in the next 12 months, compared to 67% in the 2023 report. 

Now, remember that your extended family indeed extends beyond CSPs and SaaS 
providers. Your third\-party providers include your service providers, integrators, 
hardware and infrastructure suppliers, business partners, distributors, resellers, 
telecommunications and many others that are external to the organization that 
enable your digital business. Do you have visibility across all your third\-party 
providers’ security practices? How about your fourth\-party providers?

In the next 12 months, 
84% organizations 
will use 3 or more 
CSPs and number of 
SaaS applications 
will grow 89%.

BOGO for Bad Guys 

Some grim hypotheticals: Let’s say one or more of your third\-party providers were 
targeted and breached. They should notify you about the extent of the damage and its 
implications. But what happens to you if attackers inﬁltrate your fourth\-party provider 
and impact your third party? Would you know the extent of the fallout on your 
organization? If you manage a multi\-tenant environment, a bad actor needs to attack 
only one provider to gain access to multiple customer environments.

CHAIN REACTIO N: THIRD AND FO URTH\-PARTY RISKS

Uniﬁed Visibility is a Big Blind Spot

A digital ecosystem is often made up of disparate tools that address unique requirements 
across on\-premises, hybrid and multi\-cloud environments. This applies to your cybersecurity 
technology stack too, including your identity portfolio. In fact, 26% of respondents chose “lack 
of visibility across multiple identity\-related point tools, products and services” as the top two 
truest statements for their organizations. Lack of visibility across disparate (on\-premises and 
cloud) environments was a close third.This lack of visibility extends deep into the digital 
ecosystem where risk from third\- and fourth\-party providers are hard to evaluate regularly. It 
bears repeating that vendor risk evaluation is usually the last priority in post\-breach 
investments. This needs to change.

What we asked:

On average, how many

Open Season on Sitting Ducks

Not so long ago, the industry experienced its ﬁrst double software supply chain attack on 3CX 
that impacted over 600,000 customers. Fast forward to today, and we see hackers optimizing 
their efforts and maximizing potential ﬁnancial gains with sophisticated AI\-powered cyberattacks. 
Our 2024 ﬁndings indicate that 80% of organizations experienced an identity\-related breach due 
to a supply chain attack, and 57% of these breached organizations reported that external bad 
actors were responsible. 

We are seeing a rising number of individuals, groups and nation\-states actively targeting 
technology\-critical infrastructure providers. In April 2024, hackers accessed hard\-coded secrets 
in the GitLab repositories of Sisense, a business intelligence company. The subsequent breach of 
sensitive customer data prompted the leading US\-based Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA) to issue alerts for customers to reset any shared credentials and secrets 
immediately. 

Some bad actors want to inﬂuence election outcomes, some are in it purely for ﬁnancial gain, and 
others, well, they just want your emails. Earlier this year, nation\-state\-led bad actors spied on 
executives’ emails at both Microsoft and HPE. Experts are still evaluating the extent of the 
impact. As more and more incendiaries pile into the tinderbox of a global election year, seismic 
breaches like SolarWinds could be just the starter kit.

CyberArk Insights 

Digital business is a tangled web of ever\-expanding partners and providers, each eager to 
adopt new technologies but often unable to divest from legacy environments. For identity 
security professionals, too many tools for too many use cases are the bane of their existence. 
Research tells us that 94% of organizations leverage more than 10 vendors for their 
identity\-related cybersecurity initiatives — up from 89% last year. If this is true for you, allow us 
to gently nag:

Audit and evaluate all legacy and new technologies across 
your environment.

Assess the risks of these disparate tools address vs. the time 
and effort required to maintain them.

Create a plan to consolidate your technology stack based on the 
right balance for your organization. Do this slowly but surely.

Granted, this may be a long\-term project. But we believe the light at the end of this particular 
tunnel is well worth the effort.

What This Means for You

Again, consolidating your vendor stack and deprecating those legacy tools is not an easy task. 
But there are few ways to make the process less painful.

Start with a simple question: What does “trusted third party” really mean? When qualifying a 
vendor, get a consensus with your stakeholders on why and how to stack and rank their 
experience, expertise, track record for innovation, and customer service capabilities. Look at 
analyst and earnings reports, market assessments and consider word\-of\-mouth 
recommendations. And while the shiniest and most talked\-about product or service might be 
tempting, sometimes the less glamorous tools are the best ﬁt for your unique environment.

Cyber Debt: “Shiny Object” 
Syndrome and a Blind Spot

Shiny Object Syndrome: we’ve all had it. After all, new technologies are attractive, exciting and 
capture our imaginations — and often a chunk of our organizational time and money (lookin’ at 
you, GenAI). But as we focus on adopting and implementing transformational technologies and 
addressing the Threats of the Future, cybersecurity teams cannot — even for a moment — 
afford to take their eyes off the prize of the existing and age\-old threat landscape. This is a 
recipe for disaster.

The More Things Change, the More They Stay Insane

Digital transformation continues to be the top cause of identity\-related attacks. Breaches due 
to phishing and vishing attacks have impacted 9 of 10 organizations. Nearly the same number 
of organizations were targeted by ransomware in 2024 (90%) as compared to 2023 (89%) with 
a higher number of organizations reporting damage (irretrievable loss of data).

90% were targeted by ransomware and 75% paid 
ransom but did not recover the data.

What we asked:

Which two factors are most likely to cause an identity\-related 
attack in your organization?

What we learned:

Digital transformation fueled by cloud adoption is the \#1 reason to 
likely cause an identity\-related attack.

Digital transformation initiatives (e.g. 
cloud adoption, porting legacy apps, etc.)

A vulnerable IAM (Identity Access 
Management) infrastructure

Volume and sophistication 
of cyberattacks

Geopolitical unrest and/or 
state\-sponsored cyberattacks 

Usage of third\-parties or 
external vendors

Any Identity with Sensitive Access is a Gateway

It’s important to note that unauthorized or compromised access of any business user 
(employee or third\-party contractors) is equally harmful to that of a compromised privileged 
user. We found that 64% of organizations report up to 50% of human identities have access to 
sensitive data, compared to 75% in 2023\. 

In our 2024 survey, 36% of respondents believe that more than half of their human identities 
have access to sensitive data. That’s up 11% from 2023\. In other words, every identity that has 
access to sensitive data is a privileged identity and must be secured appropriately. 

How Do I Attack Thee? Let Me Count the Ways

Our respondents indicated that they were the victim of a data breach due to one of the 
following types of attack:

Phishing and vishing happen when a user is contacted by email, telephone or text 
message by someone posing as a close personal contact or on behalf of a legitimate 
institution. Ransomware is a common example of phishing and vishing attacks. 

Credential theft is a type of cybercrime that involves stealing a user’s credentials that 
prove their identity. Once in, the bad actor(s) gains the same account privileges as the 
user. Stealing credentials is the ﬁrst stage in a credential\-based attack.

Compromised privilege access is when a bad actor gains access to a user’s login cre\-
dentials to a ﬁrewall, server or other administrative account with the highest sensitive 
access. 

Credential\-based attacks occur when criminals steal credentials to gain access, 
bypass your organization's security measures, and steal critical data.

Third\-party identity theft is when bad actor(s) gain access to your organization's 
contractors, consultants, or other people needing access to your IT resources. These 
third\-party identities (users) are not permanent in the corporate user base.

Supply chain attack uses third\-party tools or services (collectively referred to as a “supply 
chain”) to inﬁltrate a target's system or network. These attacks via your digital ecosystem 
are sometimes called "value\-chain attacks" or "third\-party attacks."

Application vulnerability is a system ﬂaw or weakness in an application's code that can be 
exploited by a malicious actor, potentially leading to a security breach. Organizations 
must patch critically vulnerable software and systems across their digital footprint. Attac\-
kers will actively target those who have not yet applied the patch.

Seriously, Yes, Ransomware Is Still a Thing

We mentioned that 9 out of 10 respondents were breached due to a phishing or vishing 
attack. Phishing or vishing attacks often lead to some form of ransomware. 

While many of us imagine a world free of ransomware, the truth is: old is gold, and humans 
are the weakest link. Ransomware is here to stay and, in fact, will increase in volume and 
sophistication with AI\-enabled deepfakes. And no matter how much cybersecurity 
awareness training is in place, bad actors will get that one innocent user to click a link or 
share that OTP which can compromise their identity and the organization's data.

No Honor Among Thieves

Ninety\-percent of organizations suffered a ransomware attack that wreaked havoc in a 
variety of ways. But perhaps the most disturbing trend is that 75% of these victims paid the 
ransom but no data was recovered — up 7% from 2023\. We also found that organizations in 
the ﬁnancial, healthcare and life sciences sectors have a signiﬁcantly higher rate of this 
twofold injury: paying ransom without recovering data.

Any Breach Is a Bad Breach

Nearly all (99%) of organizations who were victims of an identity\-related breach faced a 
direct impact to their business in the last 12 months. So how, you might ask, did that 1% 
sliver escape any negative fallout? 

In looking at additional insights, we discovered that 4% of organizations from the 
technology sector reported no negative breach\-related repercussions. Consider for a 
moment all the high\-tech providers you leverage — how many of them made headlines last 
year with a high\-proﬁle breach? Have you stopped doing business with them? Could it be 
that your digital business is so intertwined with their technology that the time and effort of 
moving to a new provider is worth the risk of staying with them?

This takes us back to the lessons learned in the risky third\- and fourth\-party sections of 
this report. Organizations are concerned with these vendor risks, but the only thing they 
can do (which most report they don't) is increase investments and the frequency of vendor 
risk assessment. 

CyberArk Insights

In its 2024 Global Risks Report, the World Economic Forum ranks misinformation and 
disinformation as \#1 in its top ten risks for the next two years — and cybersecurity as \#4\. 
Given the political and economic landscape, these two technology threats (placing in the 
top 5 of 10\) will create a new set of winners and losers in the digital landscape.

Zero Trust. Your organization must start its Zero Trust journey — yesterday. 
If you’re already implementing a Zero Trust strategy, congrats. Advance 
quickly to step 2\. 

Secure every identity across your entire environment. Leave no identity — 
human and machine — unmanaged or unsecured. This is the only way to 
ensure that identity remains a formidable defense.

Training works. Bad actors tend to prey on humans. After all, we’re 
susceptible to a false sense of trust and can rather easily be coaxed into 
sharing sensitive information. Therefore, a cadenced and mandatory 
cybersecurity awareness training is a must to slowly build cyber hygiene 
practices amongst your employees. 

Plan for the worst. No matter how much you invest in bolstering defenses, 
bad actors enjoy the challenge of ﬁnding that one overlooked vulnerability. 
Develop a contingency plan and practice tabletop exercises for key 
doomsday scenarios like ransomware, phishing, insider threats, software 
supply chain breaches, data breaches and privacy compliance attacks.

Cyber insurance. Yes, it’s hard to get insured in cyberspace. Underwriters 
are increasingly tightening guidelines and requirements. But the fact is, 
following those guidelines means you’ve developed a path to a robust 
security posture and can attain some hard\-won peace of mind.

The Path Forward

While there is no shortage of doom and gloom, signiﬁcant silver linings do exist. 
Organizations are evolving their cybersecurity strategies with new capabilities and task 
automation. Identity security organizations are adopting identity threat detection and 
response (ITDR) and passwordless authentication capabilities. Respondents have told 
us that implementing just\-in\-time (JIT) access, IGA automation and advanced user 
behavioral analytics have increased their ability to mitigate identity\-related risks and 
reduce cyber debt.

The State of Automation

All — 100% — organizations indicated that they will prioritize new tools or technologies 
in the next 12 months. Topping that list: ITDR. This emerging security discipline will help 
organizations like yours to address an all\-too\-familiar challenge: managing and securing 
the massive number of human and machine identities across the enterprise. ITDR 
enables Zero Trust initiatives, keeps identity as the central focus and protects what’s 
most precious to your organization: data. 

Our research ﬁnds that organizations are automating or partially automating 
threat\-hunting tasks, phishing analysis, password resets, alert triage and threat 
intelligence management. AI\-powered tools are also powering better breach detection 
and prevention and advanced analytics. 

However, automation and AI are not one and the same. 

Automation executes predeﬁned tasks and reduces manual intervention. AI, on the 
other hand, incorporates machine learning from large datasets to ultimately make 
decisions without explicit programming. As your organization steers from automation 
towards rapid AI\-powered decision\-making, the key is to ensure the transparency and 
explainability of that fast and furious execution. It will be up to human counterparts to 
step in and ﬁgure out the why and how behind AI’s decisions.

What we asked:

How has, or will, your organization prioritize each of the 
following tools, technologies or capabilities in the next 
12 months?

What we learned:

ITDR and passwordless authentication will see greater 
adoption in the next 12 months.

THE PATH FORWARD

Start Here

We get it: You’re adrift in a sea of issues that can or need to be 
addressed. Where do you begin?

Our respondents weighed in on the best practices that helped them 
have the most impact against identity\-related threats.

Headlining that list (tied for the \#1 spot): adopt JIT access to improve 
cloud security and automated identity governance and administration 
(IGA). Second, implement advanced AI/ML\-based behavioral analysis 
and anomaly detection.

Put Your Money Here

Apart from the need for endpoint security, federated identity, cloud 
infrastructure entitlements manager (CIEM) and multi\-factor 
authentication (MFA), we’d like to draw your attention to the smartest 
bets for your post\-breach investments. 

Third\- and fourth\-party risks are cause for signiﬁcant concern. But all 
too often, investing in vendor risk management remains at the bottom 
of the post\-breach priority list. If you've suffered a breach related to a 
third\- or fourth\-party provider, don’t be complacent. Incorporate a 
regular cadence for vendor risk assessment immediately. 

Similarly, while we know machine identities are among the riskiest, 
investments in secrets management and machine identities lag behind 
as well. These gaps must be addressed quickly to ensure a robust 
security posture. 

What we asked:

Please select up to three actions your organization has taken that have had 
the biggest positive impact on the ability to mitigate identity\-related threats 
and reduce cybersecurity debt. 

What we learned:

Implementing code security tools is rising to the top apart from securing 
human identities. 

Implementing solutions for cloud 
security (Just\-in\-Time privileged 
access to cloud resources)

Automate identity governance activities 
(removal of unused permissions, depro\-
vision accounts, etc.)

Implementing advanced AI/ML\-based 
behavioral analysis and anomaly 
detection

Implementing code security tools 
that identify and remove secrets and 
credentials

Managing privileges on the endpoints 
and enforce least privilege

Enforcing mandatory multi\-factor 
authentication (MFA)

Unifying identity management for 
ALL identities in the organization

Consolidating point tools with 
platform like capabilities

Breaking down identity silos 
(unifying or federating identities)

THE PATH FORWARD

CyberArk Insights

When challenges become overwhelming, particularly given the advent of GenAI, there 
is strength in numbers. Cybersecurity experts can learn from their peers, assess their 
own unique environments, identify the most critical areas of risk and ﬁnd a smooth 
path forward.

What This Means for You

There is constant pressure to buy new technologies to address the latest issues. We've 
seen the race to adopt GenAI for various use cases, including augmenting cybersecurity 
initiatives. It’s important to pause and reﬂect on the known and unknown risks of any 
new technology and whether its adoption outweighs the risks it brings. 

In a world where SEC can hold individual CISOs responsible for fraud and internal 
control failures, it’s nonnegotiable that you ensure transparency, accountability and 
good governance across your cybersecurity initiatives. Assess, evaluate and iterate any 
key performance indicators (KPIs) your organization has outlined. 

You are undoubtedly in a fast\-paced world with a long list of daily Sisyphean challenges. 
Every defense you put up becomes a game that bad actors love to win. And it only takes 
one misstep by anyone on your team to bring down the stack of cards. 

The one advantage we have is each other. 

"Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships." That’s not our 
quote (it’s Michael Jordan’s) but the advice is timeless. The team at your back isn't 
limited to your immediate colleagues. It spans your entire organization and even to your 
third\- and fourth\-party providers. It may be the storm of the century, but together, we 
can hold the fortress down.
