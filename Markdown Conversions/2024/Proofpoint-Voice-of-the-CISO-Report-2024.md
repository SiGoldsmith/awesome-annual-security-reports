2024: Navigating the Cybersecurity 
Maelstrom

CISOs have had a lot to contend with in recent years: a global pandemic, large\-
scale remote work and record levels of employee turnover. From the outside looking 
in, one could be forgiven for thinking the past 12 months have been serene by 
comparison.

But for CISOs caught in the whirlwind, this was the year the perfect storm reached its 
peak.

Thanks to hybrid working as standard and the growing reliance on cloud technology, 
the attack surface has never been larger. Cyber threats are more targeted, 
sophisticated and frequent than ever before. Meanwhile, employees are increasingly 
mobile—often taking data with them when they change jobs. 

And while generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools hold great promise, they also 
have lowered the bar to entry for cyber criminals. Anyone with a few dollars now has 
the means to launch devastating attacks.

To be sure, CISOs are enjoying closer ties with key stakeholders, board members 
and regulators. But this proximity also brings higher stakes, more pressure and 
heightened expectations. And with flat or reduced budgets, CISOs must try to do 
much more with considerably less. In this environment of tight resources and rapid 
change, shortcuts are sometimes necessary. But they can lead to human error. 

To better understand how CISOs are navigating another high\-pressure year, 
Proofpoint surveyed 1,600 CISOs around the world. We asked them about their roles, 
their outlook for the next two years and how they see their responsibilities evolving. 
For richer insights into complex cybersecurity practices, this year’s Voice of the CISO 
surveyed only organizations with 1,000 or more employees.

In this summary, we explore the delicate balance between concern and confidence 
as many factors combine to ramp up the pressure on the CISO.

We hear how our people continue to put us at risk and what organizations are doing 
to bolster human\-centric defenses. We also delve into the mind of the CISO, tackling 
the challenging topics of burnout, personal liability and boardroom relationships.

Finally, we look to the years ahead to get a better understanding of what we can 
expect on the cybersecurity horizon.

As always, this report would not have been possible without the insight offered by 
cybersecurity and information security professionals across the globe. We offer our 
sincere thanks for your time and feedback.

2024 VOICE OF THE CISO \\ REPORTHeightened Concerns but Growing 
Confidence 

CISOs are struggling with a jarring mix of challenges: the waning cybersecurity spotlight 
as the pandemic fades from view; the ongoing struggle to secure remote and hybrid 
workforces; whiplash as workforces reel from the Great Resignation, tech layoffs and 
constant business restructuring; and the rise of hard\-to\-detect yet easy\-to\-execute threats.

Whatever the cause, one thing is clear: CISOs are nervously looking over the horizon.

Over two\-thirds (70%) of those surveyed feel at risk of a material cyber attack over the next 
12 months. This figure is only a slight increase from 68% last year. But compared to 48% of 
respondents who felt so in 2022, today’s CISOs clearly remain on high alert. 

That just under a third (31%) feel a significant attack is “very likely” further underlines the 
CISO’s collective anxiety, compared to 25% in 2023\.

Awareness vs Preparedness

A growing concern around the likelihood of a cyber attack may seem like bad news. Still, 
that most CISOs are aware of the potential risks they face is heartening.

Put simply, CISOs are right to be concerned; as cyber criminals refine their tactics, target 
our people and work along the attack chain for maximum impact.

There’s more room for positive thinking when we look at security preparedness, too. A 
little under half (43%) of CISOs agree that their organization is unprepared to cope with a 
targeted cyber attack in 2024\. This is something of an improvement on 2023 (61%) and 
2022 (50%).

But while it's good news that more CISOs feel prepared for the challenges ahead, we can’t 
ignore those who do not share this sentiment.

That 70% feel at risk of a cyber attack yet almost half feel unprepared for its impact 
is concerning. It highlights again the unwavering disconnect between cybersecurity 
awareness and preparedness.

CISO’s view of the threat landscape

What keeps CISOs awake at night? Not surprisingly, 41% see ransomware as the leading 
threat across the next 12 months. Malware (38%), email fraud (36%), cloud account 
compromise (34%), Insider threats (30%) and DDoS attacks (30%) round out the top five 
concerns.

Several of these issues—email fraud, insider threats, DDoS attacks, and cloud account 
compromise— remain on the list from last year. Ransomware’s rise to the top of the list is 
an interesting change, if not unsurprising given high\-profile attacks in 2023 and into 2024\.

Attackers have greatly raised the stakes with double and triple extortion threats and 
maturing ransomware ecosystems. That’s why CISOs must look for opportunities to 
disrupt attacks at every stage of the attack chain—from initial compromise to lateral 
movement and privilege escalation to data exfiltration.

2024 VOICE OF THE CISO \\ REPORTOn another positive note, boards seem increasingly receptive to the concerns of the 
CISO. Both appear to be closely aligned; board members see malware, insider threats, 
cloud account compromise and ransomware as the biggest cybersecurity threats 
facing their organizations. 

Ransomware is the top concern 
among CISOs in Japan (64%), 
UK (51%), Sweden (49%) and the 
Netherlands (49%).

Among industries, manufacturing 
and production (54%), retail (46%), 
and healthcare (43%) all agree that 
ransomware will be the biggest threat 
over the next 12 months.

Malware threats lead the way in Italy 
(53%), Brazil (46%) and Singapore 
(45%).

Email fraud remains among the top 
three concerns since the first Voice of 
the CISO report in 2021\. This year, it is 
of the most concern among CISOs in 
Saudi Arabia (50%), Australia (46%), 
Germany (46%), Canada (42%), The 
Netherlands (42%) and Japan (42%).

Email fraud, however is seen as the 
biggest threat over the next 12 months 
by the following industries: public 
sector (61%), transport (58%) and 
financial services (41%).

“

In today's evolving threat landscape, CISOs are navigating through the aftermath of the pandemic, adjusting to the new 
normal of hybrid work, and grappling with enormous tech industry shifts. Amid these transformative times, the emergence of 
sophisticated cyber threats that exploit human vulnerabilities and systems is undeniable. While the heightened probability of 
cyber attacks might seem alarming, it's reassuring that CISOs are acutely aware and prepared for potential risks. The concern 
CISOs harbor is a testament to their vigilance; recognizing that cyber criminals are continuously honing their strategies to exploit 
every link in our security chains.

Human Error: The Persistent Vulnerability

Just as concern around impending cyber attacks is growing, so too is the consensus on 
the top risk factor: people. In a year of growing insider threats and data loss caused by 
people, more CISOs than ever see human error as their biggest cyber vulnerability.

Almost three\-quarters (74%) of surveyed CISOs feel this way, up from 60% in 2023 
and 56% in 2022\. Board members are not as convinced. A little under two\-thirds (63%) 
agree that human error is the biggest vulnerability, suggesting that CISOs have more 
work to do to bring the boardroom up to speed.

of CISOs consider human 

error to be their organization’s 

biggest cyber vulnerability.

Global Average
2024 \= 74%
2023 \= 60%

An even higher number of CISOs (80%) see human risk, including employee negligence, 
as a key cybersecurity concern over the next two years. That’s up from 63% in 2023\. This 
sentiment was most keenly felt in France (91%), Canada (90%), Spain (86%), South Korea 
(85%) and Singapore (84%).

CISOs seem to understand that, given most successful cyber attacks require human 
interaction, data loss is inherently a people problem. Still, 86% believe their employees 
understand their role in defending their organization; almost half (45%) strongly agree.

In other words, CISOs believe their people know what is being asked of them but still feel 
that they pose an enormous risk. The implication: users grasp what’s expected of them 
but lack the skills, knowledge and tools required to defend their organization’s data.

CISOs in Saudi Arabia (84%), 
Canada (83%) and France 
(82%) are most concerned 
about human error being their 
organization’s biggest cyber 
vulnerability. 

CISOs within these sectors: 
education (89%), media

Protecting against the people problem

To mitigate this area of human vulnerability, many CISOs are turning to AI\-powered 
technology. Of those surveyed, 87% are looking to deploy such tools to protect against 
human error and block advanced human\-centric cyber threats.

This holds true across all surveyed industries, with retail (81%), IT, technology and 
telecoms (89%) and education (88%) leading the way.

“

As the digital landscape evolves, CISOs unanimously point to one constant in the cybersecurity equation: the human element. 

Despite recognizing that insider threats and inadvertent data mishandling are on the rise, there's a consensus that employees 

are aware of their cybersecurity responsibilities. Yet, there's an acknowledgment of a critical gap — understanding doesn't 

always equate to capability. To bridge this divide, CISOs increasingly seek AI\-driven technologies as an ally in reinforcing human 

defenses against sophisticated cyber threats.

Data Protection and Insider Threats 

An increasing awareness of both risk levels and risk factors looks to have translated to 
tighter security over the past 12 months. This year, fewer than half (46%) of global CISOs 
reported a material loss of sensitive information—down from 63% last year.

That said, several countries came in considerably higher than this worldwide average. Over 
two\-thirds (77%) of CISOs in South Korea reported the loss of sensitive data, followed by 
61% in Canada, 58% in France and 57% in Germany. 

77% of organizations in South 
Korea dealt with material data 
loss in the last year – the 
highest rate of any country 
surveyed.

Where industries are concerned, education (68%), financial services (54%) and media, 
leisure and entertainment (54%) are the most affected by sensitive data loss in this 
year’s report. 

As for what’s behind these events, many familiar faces are on display. Of the CISOs who 
experienced a sensitive data loss, 42% lay the blame on negligent insiders/careless 
employees. Other common factors include external attacks (40%) and malicious or 
criminal insiders (36%).

Employees are also potentially responsible for many more factors on the list, from system 
misconfiguration (27%) to lost or stolen devices (28%).

Human factors have risen year over year, representing the leading cause of data loss. It’s 
no wonder that people remain such a pressing concern for the world’s CISOs.

Malicious or criminal insiders 
are the third leading cause 
of data loss after external 
attacks (cyber criminal or 
state\-sponsored). They are the 
No. 1 factor in Australia (49%), 
UAE (44%), Germany (44%) 
and France (38%)

What was the cause of the data loss event? (Pick all that apply.)
(Respondents whose organization dealt with a material loss of sensitive information in the past 12 months.)

To further underline this point, people continue to contribute to data loss elsewhere. 
Almost three\-quarters (73%) of CISOs said that employees leaving their organization 
played a role in a data loss event.

As the rate of resignations fell back to pre\-pandemic levels in many countries towards the 
end of 2023, concern around losing data to job switchers is down from 82% last year. But 
there is no room for complacency. The modern workforce changes jobs more frequently 
than any generation in history, and data will continue to leave with them at an alarming 
rate.

The trend is most pronounced among industries that handle large amounts of highly 
sensitive information, underlining the challenge of protecting data against intentional 
exfiltration.

95% 

of CISOs in the education 

sector have lost data with 

an employee leaving their 

organization. Healthcare 

(89%), media, leisure and 

entertainment (88%), financial 

services (83%) and transport 

(80%) complete the top five.

financial loss (43%), post\-attack recovery costs such as operational downtime and data 
recovery (41%) and loss of critical data (40%).

What was the end result of the event on your organization? (Pick all that apply.) 
(Respondents whose organization dealt with material loss of sensitive information in the past 12 months.)

New tools and changing priorities

Combating data loss remains a top priority for CISOs around the world, for obvious 
reasons. About half educate employees about security best practices (53%) and use cloud 
security solutions (52%) to get a handle on the issue.

Others deploy dedicated data loss prevention (DLP) technology (51%), endpoint security 
(49%), email security (48%) or isolation technology (42%) to block employees from 
entering credentials on web forms.

As people remain our most vital line of defense right across the attack chain, CISOs are 
right to place user education as a pivotal part of their security strategy. But given that 80% 
of CISOs also see human error and negligence as a top concern, it’s not clear what fruits 
those efforts have borne.

What protocols do you have in place to combat organizational data loss?

Financial loss (43%), post\-
attack recovery costs 
(operational downtime, data 
recovery, legal) (41%) and 
loss of critical data (40%) are 
the biggest consequences of 
data loss.

Going forward, CISOs have a clear idea of how best to tackle data loss. Some 87% agree 
that information protection and data governance are top priorities. This is a major uptick 
from previous years—61% in 2023 and 59% in 2022\.

The adoption of DLP technology has also surged, up to 51% this year from 35% in 2023\. 
As a result, 81% of CISOs now believe that their data is adequately protected. That’s up 
from 60% in 2023 and 56% in 2022\.

As outlined in Proofpoint’s 2023 Board Perspective Report three\-quarters of board 
members shared this view, putting the boardroom in closer agreement with their CISOs 
than in previous years.

11

2024 VOICE OF THE CISO \\ REPORTSpotlight on: Recovery

Every CISO strives to defend the organization from cyber attacks. But as threats grow 
more advanced and targeted, security teams often work from the premise that their 
defenses will be compromised or breached at some point. And when that happens, they 
need to know how to recover—fast.

In a ransomware attack, 62% of CISOs said their organizations would likely pay the 
attacker to restore systems or avoid the release of company data. This figure is unchanged 
from last year’s survey.

Many others plan to rely on insurance coverage. Overall, 79% of CISOs agree that if hit by 
a cyber attack in the next 12 months, they would use cyber insurance to cover losses. 

Investing in cyber insurance is usually a preferred option. But it’s no substitute for a robust 
cybersecurity defense. Buying a comprehensive policy is not as straightforward as it 
once was. And insurers often insist on stringent protocols and protections as a condition 
of coverage. CISOs using insurance as a fallback should check policy documents and 
ensure their organization has the right amount and type of coverage.

If impacted by ransomware 
within the next 12 months, my 
organization is likely to pay a 
ransom to restore systems/
prevent the release of data.

CISOs worldwide continue to strengthen cyber defenses, recognizing that the human factor continues to be the primary driver 

of data loss. Even as the tidal wave of resignations stabilizes, the transient nature of today's workforce signifies that the risk of 

data walking out the door remains more than a mere possibility—it's an alarming certainty. Particularly in sectors where sensitive 

information is the currency, CISOs find no reprieve from vigilance. The relentless pace of job movement ensures that protecting 

against data loss is not just a priority but an ongoing battle in the digital realm.

The Cyber Realities for a CISO in 2024

There’s been no way to avoid the rise of generative AI over the past year. Whether it’s a net 
force for good or bad will play out—and be debated—for years to come. But one thing’s 
for sure: it’s not going anywhere.

So far, CISOs are approaching the technology with a degree of caution. A little more than 
half (54%) believe the technology poses some form of a security risk to their organization.

Spotlight on AI: The double\-edged sword 

Much is made of AI's potential to aid cyber criminals, and rightly so. With this technology, 
attacks could get easier to scale and simpler to carry out. Advanced techniques once out 
of reach for anyone but well\-funded cyber criminal gangs and state\-sponsored attackers 
are now up for grabs.

However, greater accessibility of generative AI models can only help defenders, too. Even 
in these early stages, we can already connect the dots between external threats, sensitive 
content and anomalous behaviors or activity. That’s something that has not been possible 
at the same speed and scale with human moderation or traditional analysis. 

With this information, we can intervene in communications, focus protections where they 
are most needed and stop or limit threats before they occur. 

Given the hype\-and\-bust cycle of many technology trends, it might be tempting to dismiss 
AI as another fad. But it’s already changing cybersecurity. And as the technology improves 
and security leaders learn new and better ways to apply it, AI could transform the industry.

Teams and other collaboration tools (39%), as well as the ubiquitous Microsoft 365 (38%).

Spotlight on budgets and priorities

AI is not the only major trend taking its toll on CISOs. Changing economic conditions 
around the world are also piling added pressure on already overstretched security 
teams.

Overall, 59% of CISOs agree that economic conditions have hurt their organization, 
up slightly from 58% in the previous year.

CISOs in South Korea are being hit the hardest, with 79% feeling the impact of the 
turbulent economy. Those in Canada (72%), France (68%), Germany (68%) and 
Spain (64%) are not far behind. 

With many security budgets remaining flat at best, CISOs know they are tasked with 
doing more—or at least, the same—for less. Almost half (48%) have been asked to 
cut staff, delay backfills or reduce spending. 

To deliver the most value in this environment, most (58%) plan to focus on improving 
information protection and enabling greater business innovation, just like we saw in 
2023\.

In a notable change to last year’s findings, improving employee cybersecurity 
awareness is now the second\-highest priority for the CISOs. While perhaps not 
surprising, the ranking gives yet another clear sign that human\-centric security is now 
a firm fixture in most cyber strategies.

“

The ascent of generative AI has been inescapable, marking a new era in cybersecurity that's here to stay, inciting debates 

on its ultimate impact. CISOs tread carefully, cognizant of AI's double\-edged sword—its democratization grants both cyber 

criminals and defenders unprecedented capabilities. Cyber attacks could become more scalable and effortless, yet this very 

technology equips us with real\-time insights into threats, a feat unachievable by traditional means. While skepticism often greets 

technological revolutions, dismissing AI's potential in cybersecurity would be a misstep; it's not just reshaping the field—it's 

poised to revolutionize it as we adapt and harness its evolving power.

Strengthening Board\-CISO Relations 

As a recent addition to most boardrooms—and still a worrying omission from some—the 
CISO has traditionally struggled to get on the same page as the rest of the board.

Back in 2022, only half (51%) of surveyed CISOs reported seeing eye to eye with their 
boards. This figure increased only slightly to 62% in 2023\.

This status quo looks to be changing, however. This year, 84% of CISOs say they see 
eye to eye with board members on the issue of cybersecurity. The shift echoed across all 
industries, with healthcare (91%), transport (88%) and energy, oil/gas and utilities (81%) 
among those most in agreement.

84%

expertise should be required 

at the board level.

Percentage of CISOs by industry who agree their board sees eye to eye with them on the issue of cybersecurity.

Many factors are likely behind this notable change. Many CISOs have kept their place at 
the table post\-pandemic, influencing wider business strategy as a result. For their part, 
they may also have taken steps to speak the language of the boardroom, successfully 
translating security concerns into potential business impact.

This development may have driven the marked increase in CISOs believing cybersecurity 
expertise to be a board\-level requirement—up to 84% from 62% in 2023\. If the CISO is to 
remain in the boardroom, it makes sense that they would expect other board members to 
better understand their remit.

Has this perceived cohesion truly led to a greater understanding? It certainly looks that 
way.

CISO’s believe that their board’s greatest concerns about a material cyber attack are: 
disruption to operations (44%), loss in revenue (44%) and reputational damage (43%).

CISOs have come a long way from being on the sidelines to becoming key players in the boardroom. The recent global 

pandemic served to not only cement the CISOs’ role but also put them front and center in shaping business strategy, speaking 

in language that resonates with the C\-suite and relating security in terms of business outcomes. This sea change has resulted 

in cybersecurity becoming a board\-level skill, and an important success factor for any executive to have as part of their 

professional portfolio. It is becoming clearer every day that Board\-CISO integration is not a temporary fad, rather an enduring 

enhancement to business strategy that will be necessary for success in the modern digital era.

The Story Continues… 
Unrelenting Pressure on CISOs

The CISO's journey in recent years is one of progress. Since Proofpoint began producing 
Voice of the CISO in 2021, we’ve seen three encouraging trends:

 • An increase in cybersecurity representation at the board level

 • Closer alignment between CISOs and board members

 • Growing acceptance of the need for human\-centric security strategies

But progress is very rarely linear. And as any protector knows, with great power comes 
great responsibility. The added prominence and deference to CISOs around the world has 
brought more pressure, higher stakes and greater scrutiny to the role—at times, perhaps 
too much.

Two\-thirds (66%) of CISOs surveyed for this year’s report agree that expectations of the 
CISO/CSO are unrealistic.

Percentage of CISOs who agree that there are excessive expectations on the CISO/CSO. 

66% 

of CISOs believe there are 

excessive expectations on the 

CISO/CSO. This is a continued 

increase on previous years...
2023 \= 61%
2022 \= 49%
2021 \= 21%

Global Average \= 66%

Worse, their concerns have gone unanswered. The feeling has risen—sometimes 
sharply—every single year of our survey.

The result of these excessive demands runs much further than overstretched resources 
and low job satisfaction. More than half (53%) of the world’s CISOs have experienced or 
witnessed burnout in the past 12 months. 

This finding is understandably concerning. But we are seeing some progress in this 
regard. Almost a third of CISOs (31%) say they haven’t witnessed or faced burnout, up 
from just 15% last year.

CISOs in South Korea (72%), 
Sweden (63%) and Australia 
(62%) are most likely to have 
experienced or witnessed 
burnout.

Personal liability remains a concern

Several high\-profile legal cases involving CISOs only add to the mounting pressure on 
the role. Most notably, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought 
landmark charges against a SolarWinds CISO last year for “fraud and internal control 
failures” in the lead\-up to the company’s 2020 supply chain attack.

With incidents like these top of mind, 66% of global CISOs are concerned about personal, 
financial and legal liability in their role. That’s up slightly from 62% in 2023\.

Fears over a lack of protection are causing some CISOs to think twice when making career 
decisions, too. This year’s survey found that some 72% would not join an organization 
that doesn’t offer directors \& officers (D\&O) insurance or similar coverage against financial 
liability in the event of a successful cyberattack.

Those in manufacturing and production (75%), financial services (74%) and retail (68%) 
feel most strongly about the issue.

Conclusion

Even after a tough year, CISOs are finding reasons to stay positive. More are 
concerned about a material cyber attack in the near future. But fewer feel 
unprepared, suggesting greater confidence in their efforts to prevent and defend 
against attacks.

Most also report closer relationships with key stakeholders and the boardroom. This 
change underscores the growing recognition of the role at the highest levels of the 
organization and importance of cybersecurity.

Still, CISOs have plenty to keep them busy. Employee turnover remains a critical 
concern. Employee turnover has become the norm, with job leavers posing a 
sustained risk of data loss across all sectors. Spotting this trend, most CISOs have 
adopted DLP technology and invested in education.

In the meantime, the threat landscape will continue to evolve. Familiar foes like 
ransomware and BEC attacks remain a big cause for concern. And emerging 
technologies such as AI pose new challenges.

But ultimately, people and their behaviors continue to pose the greatest ongoing 
risk to organizations. Fortunately, many CISOs are investing more in human\-centric 
security approaches in response. Despite its risks, AI also has the potential to help. 
Intelligent tools that can intervene to warn against or block risky behaviors in real time 
will be pivotal in the ongoing fight against human error.

Another challenge to CISOs may well be the job itself. With growing concern around 
personal liability and increasing numbers reporting excessive expectations, burnout 
and challenging budgets, the pressure continues to mount. Solving this problem 
must be a top priority if we are to ensure modern CISOs are equipped for the scale of 
the task they continue to face now and into the future.
