# ENSIGN INFOSECURITY CYBER THREAT LANDSCAPE 2024

Version 1.4 | 10 May 2024

## EDITOR’S FOREWORD

Cybersecurity remains one of the most pressing challenges facing nations, organisations, and even individuals.
Ensign InfoSecurity is dedicated to supporting the cybersecurity needs of a wide variety of clients. We publish this
report to share our unique insights and perspectives into threats, trends, and topics with business leaders and
cybersecurity professionals.

As Ensign continues to grow our operational presence overseas, this year’s report features coverage of Singapore,
Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea, and our recent expansions in Australia and the Greater China Region (Hong
Kong S.A.R. and mainland China). We also bring our cybersecurity expertise, experience, and unique Asia-first lens
on cybersecurity challenges to global platforms that we participate in, to help shape global discussions.

We believe in using a Threat-Informed Defence approach. Our Ensign Threat Classification Matrix for identified
threat groups helps organisations to prioritise their cyber defences against the territory-contextualised threats. We
provide the MITRE ATT&CK heatmaps to support organisations in prioritising their cyber defences against specific
adversary techniques and follow-through defensive actions, such as threat hunting, Red Teaming, and tuning of
detection rules. We have also laid out the observed top targeted industry groups and top exploited vulnerabilities.

With every case our incident response team handles, we learn a little more about how attackers operate. They are
evolving to find gaps in our processes, in addition to pushing harder on the weaknesses in our systems and
people. While we design, build, and operate a variety of protective systems for organisations, we also advise our
clients that resilience, not just building higher defensive walls, should be the objective towards sustainable and
predictable defence outcomes.

We are seeing first-hand how cybersecurity and the foundations of digital trust are being tested by the exploitation
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) among threat actors. Our researchers are investigating how they use AI to accelerate
malware and exploit development, or evade detection. AI is being extensively used in influence operations through
Misinformation, Disinformation, and Malinformation (MDM), which distort reality, especially amidst a cyber crisis.
We study these threats and trends to advise clients on how to deal with the risks of emerging technologies.

Our continued investment and contribution towards sharing our insights are aimed at enabling companies to
better defend against the threats relevant to them. Companies cannot choose whether they become targets, but
they can decide how they respond to a cyber-attack, and whether they can recover smoothly and with predictable
outcomes.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Cybersecurity continues to be a critical challenge faced
by nations, organisations, and individuals. To effectively
defend against cyber threats requires, business leaders
and cyber professionals must remain informed about the
latest threats, risks, and challenges. This year’s report
offers increased coverage, due to the expansion of our
operational footprint, and deeper analysis attributed to
the quality of our data and intelligence sources. These
enhancements enable us to provide unique insights and
observations for 2023, and forecasts for 2024.

### Territorial Insights

In our analysis of the different territories Ensign operates in, we observed
unique difference in each of them. The most targeted industry groups
across our territories were Technology, Media and Telecommunications
(TMT), Government, Manufacturing, and Financial Services. We
continued to observe both state-sponsored threat groups and organised
crime groups (notably those which exploit through deployment of
Ransomware) in the region. Ransomware remains the dominant threat in
nearly every territory we studied. Additionally, we observed a rise in
hacktivism (malicious cyber activity motivated by a cause) associated
with the spillover effects from the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the
normalisation of such activities during the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

### Escalating Threats

Our active involvement in international
platforms like the United Nations (UN), World
Economic Forum (WEF), and Geneva Dialogue,
allows us to understand the spillover effects of
geopolitics into the cyber domain. While
malicious activity directly related to the Russia-
Ukraine conflict may have dwindled, an uptick
in Hamas-Israel hacktivism has filled the void.
Additionally, tech bifurcation remains another
geopolitically charged issue, complicating
procurement decisions in the short term
(especially as some countries implement bans
on companies using software or hardware from
other countries), and possibly worsening
cybersecurity for all in the longer term.

We are seeing first-hand how cybersecurity and
digital trust is being transformed by Artificial
Intelligence (AI) — whether it is infused in our
own tools, discovered in a weaponised form
through our threat research, or through our
expert policy development and advisory
guidance to organisations. While Generative AI-
driven scams and phishing emails troubled our
systems in 2023, 2024 will see a spike in
Misinformation, Disinformation, and
Malinformation (MDM) amidst an election-filled
year around the world. Reality can also be
distorted by ruthless attackers, especially
amidst a cyber crisis.

### Evolving Attacks

With every case our incident response team
handles, we learn a little more about how
attackers operate. Attackers are exploiting
weaknesses in our cyber processes to evade
detection; instead of getting in through the “high
severity” vulnerabilities that companies tend to
patch quickly and monitor closely, they use
“low” risk vulnerabilities that are de-prioritised
for patching for weeks. Rather than bring in
hefty payloads that might trigger detection
rules, they have developed sophisticated “living
off the land” techniques to stay below the radar.

Supply chain risks and sophisticated attacks
also make it harder to defend every threat
vector. Attackers are compromising critical
nodes in common commercial network
hardware, making defences even harder.

Companies cannot control whether they
become targets, but they can prepare how to
respond to cyber-attacks and take practical
steps to recover smoothly with minimal
damage.

### Emerging Rules

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity,
it is paramount for new regulations and policies
to be aimed at enhancing data protection,
fortifying the security of critical systems, and
strengthening digital infrastructure. Many
countries are introducing or enhancing cyber
and data legislation (some with politicised
motives).

While we design, build, and operate a variety of
protective systems for organisations, we also
advise our clients that resilience, not just
building higher defensive walls, should be the
objective beyond a certain point.

### Conclusion

Whether you sit at the technical-operational
layer, the executive layer, or the board
oversight/governance layer, the challenges of
navigating the complexities of cybersecurity are
significant. In this regard, implementing new
regulatory frameworks and policy initiatives will
play an instrumental role in building our
defences against cyber threats.

Hopefully, the insights and analysis in our report
can help you make more informed decisions
about what is best for your needs. Ensign stands
ready to protect your organisation’s digital
journey from the ever-expanding array of threats
and risks.

## TERRITORIAL INSIGHTS

### Overview of Territorial Insights

Ensign’s regional offices (Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea,
and now Australia and the Greater China Region) are situated in locations
within the Asia-Pacific region with high cyber activities, charged by
geopolitical tensions (e.g. US-China tensions, South China Sea
disagreements, and China-Taiwan tensions), and uneven (but generally
growing) economies. Across these territories, Ensign continues to
observe increased digitalisation efforts and the use of a wide range of
hardware and software solutions, adding to the complexity in managing
the cybersecurity risks in the digital attack surface.

Ransomware continues to be lucrative for the threat groups (and the most
prominent threat across most regions), not only as a financial gain tool,
but due to the sustained investments by cyber weapons developers,
become a useful and effective cyber weapon to cause pain to targeted
organisations. The most active Ransomware groups observed across the
territories include, ALPHV, BlackCat Gang, FIN11, and LockBit Gang.

While we observed both state-sponsored threat groups and organised
crime groups active in the region, we also saw rising activities associated
with hacktivism due to spillover effects from the Israel-Hamas conflict
occurring from the end of 2023. This has generally led to rising partisan
collective groups taking actions into their own hands for the ideological
causes. Notable hacktivist groups observed active in our region included
Bjorka, DragonForce Malaysia, SynixCyberCrimMY, GhostSec, Muslim
Cyber Army, VulzSec and Ganosec Team. The challenge in addressing
hacktivism stems from their lack of a definitive structure and unique
processes and procedures for each group. Instead, individuals involved in
adversarial actions leverage their individual competencies and
capabilities to further their cause. While organisations who do well in
addressing cyber hygiene measures are generally resilient against
hacktivist threats, the level of sophistication and effects are also rising.
These groups have been observed to perform not just the distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and website defacements, but now, with
the accessibility to offensive services (e.g. Ransomware as a Service),
some attacks are inflicting greater harm to organisations when these
attacks breach the defences.

Aside from hacktivism, Ensign has seen sustained activities from initial
access brokers active in the territories, who have not only been
successful in obtaining and selling access to organisations, but also due
to rising Law enforcement activities targeting the Ransomware operators,
started to opportunistically exfiltrate and sell the victim’s data even
before sale of access. This has led to some cyber-attack campaigns
having lost the adversaries’ element of surprise due to lack of operational
security (OpsSec). Active initial access brokers (IABs) observed across
the territories include APT-C-01 (Poison Ivy), BITTER, Scattered Spider,
and UNC5221. IABs such as Scattered Spider are known to obtain
financial gain through sale of access and opportunistically sell data
obtained during acquisition of access.

Aside from initial access brokers and Ransomware groups, 2023 saw 21
threat groups actively targeting the Ensign operating territories. There are
more state-sponsored threat groups (16) than organised crime groups
(5) observed. Russian-associated threat groups, APT28, FIN7, and Turla,
are representative groups that have returned to target the Ensign
operating territories. GambleForce and Lazarus Group were observed to
have targeted all Ensign’s operating territories.

The five organised crime groups observed across the territories, aside
from the aforementioned Ransomware Groups and Initial Access Brokers,
are Carderbee, Desorden, FIN7, Patchwork, and Poison Carp. Malaysia
and Indonesia generally shared the same threat groups, with the
exception of Desorden which continued its targeting of Malaysia, and
Turla which targeted Indonesia.

Due to the aforementioned tensions across the territories, there are more
threat groups observed to be motivated by surveillance, information theft
and espionage. Particularly on surveillance of populations, we noted that
Kimsuky and Poison Carp are threat groups which target mobile devices for
surveillance outcomes with the harvesting of personal data and information.

Attacks on network equipment with significant impact were seen across
territories. The stealthy and persistent effects of breaches performed by Volt
Typhoon were prominent, especially with their KV-Botnet to compromise
long-term unpatched and end-of-life networking products (such as Netgear
ProSAFE routers, CISCO RV 320/325 routers, Draytek Vigor routers, and AXIS
IP cameras). Some of these devices are installed in the operational
technology (OT) environment or next-to-OT environments (possibly affecting
essential services and other OT-centric businesses such as manufacturing) in
territories such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Australia.

Cyber supply chain attacks have also manifested in a big way across the
territories in 2023, causing some big brands / organisations to be breached.
Notably, cyber-attacks exploiting vulnerabilities are found in commonly used
commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions such as MOVEit Managed File
Transfer (MFT) software, Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway, Confluence
Server and Data Center, Zoho ManageEngine, 3CX Desktop Application,
GoAnywhere MFT, Ivanti Connect Secure VPN, PaperCut Application Server,
Veam Backup & Replication, and others.

Based on our incident responses, Ensign noted that the minimum Dwell time
increased compared to 2022 (0 days). This could be attributed to the
increasing technology sprawl as organisations work through technology
refresh and the continued use of Cloud-based services. The maximum Dwell
time decreased significantly from 1,095 days to 49 days. This is encouraging
as it indicates that organisations may be increasing their detection
capabilities. Contrasting the average Dwell time observed from 2022, there
has also been a decrease to 5 days for Retail, 22 days for TMT, and 33 days
for Others, observed this year (last year we observed the average of 71 days
average Dwell time for Transport sector and 83 days for Others).

**Overview of Territorial Insights**

Across the territories, the top targeted industry groups were as follows:

The most common industry groups were Technology, Media and
Telecommunications (TMT), Government, Financial Services, and
Manufacturing.

> Across this section, Ensign has provided key MITRE ATT&CK techniques for each relevant context for readers to use for follow-on defensive actions such as Red Teaming, threat
> hunting, and to tune the detection measures. Full versions of the techniques heatmaps can be found in Appendix A with links to download MITRE ATT&CK Navigator JSON files
> for further review, and top tactics can be found in Appendix C. Full versions of the vulnerabilities observed in the territories can be found in Appendix B.

We saw Technology, Media and Telecommunications (TMT) as the top
industry group targeted across all the territories. This is attributed to the
increased levels of digitalisation post-pandemic and the push for greater
productivity through exploitation of higher network bandwidth, AI and
automation as well as the push for digital payments and digital trade systems
across ASEAN and the Asia Pacific region.

The Government industry group was observed to be targeted across
Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea, Australia and the Greater China Region.
We attribute this to political events such as elections or geopolitical matters
such as the US-China tensions.

The Financial services industry group was observed to be targeted across
Singapore, Indonesia, South Korea, Australia and the Greater China
Region. We attribute this to the natural concentration of personal data, which
is useful for espionage and surveillance related activities, as well as access to
funds, especially through cryptocurrency wallets and brokerage accounts.

The Manufacturing industry group was observed to be targeted across
Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea. With the rebalancing of
manufacturing capacity due to “de-risking” efforts between US and China,
Southeast Asian countries and allies of US (i.e. South Korea) benefits from
ramped up manufacturing demand which is progressively driving the
economic growth post-pandemic. Industrial espionage is also a common
reason why threat actors are interested in this industry group. The threat
actors typically target the trade secrets and industrial designs, including
business relationships and contracts. Additionally, some threat actors are
interested in having the capability to cause disruption to the supply chain by
targeting the companies in this industry group.

Our analysis of the top techniques observed saw T1110: Brute Force
common across Singapore, Malaysia & Indonesia and the Greater China
Region. Amongst others, T1595: Active Scanning and T1078: Valid Accounts
were observed across Singapore, Malaysia & Indonesia. T1071: Application
Layer Protocol was observed across Singapore and the Greater China
Region.

The cyber-attack effects observed across the territories saw Ransom
observed across all territories. Next most common cyber-attack effect was
Sale of Access, followed by Sale of Data, Data Leak and Denial of Service.
