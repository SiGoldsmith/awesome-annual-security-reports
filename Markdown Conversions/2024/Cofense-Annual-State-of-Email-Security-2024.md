Introduction

Here’s the reality. 

In 2023, malicious email threats bypassing secure email gateways (SEGs) 
increased by more than 100% . In other words, your email security solutions 
aren’t stopping the threats you think they are . 

We know because: 
• We are the only email security company with a global network of 35\+ million 

trained employees reporting suspected threats around the clock 
• Our proprietary data provides unmatched industry insights with a 

99\.998% accuracy rate 

• No one else has over a decade of insights and intelligence into the threats 

that EVERY SEG misses 

• Last year we caught a malicious email EVERY MINUTE that bypassed our 

customers SEG 

Security threats are real, they continue to grow, and they are likely to 
penetrate an organization through email . Organizations simply cannot settle 
for ‘Good Enough’ email security and sole reliance on a SEG is not enough . As 
we all know, it only takes one breach to damage a company’s financial status, 
brand reputation, and/or relationship with its employees and customers . 

Each day, our analysts see thousands of threats that are bypassing all SEGs 
on the market . 

That’s exactly why Cofense® has spent the last decade perfecting our 
phishing expertise, growing our network of Cofense\-trained employees 
around the globe, and setting ourselves apart from the competition – simply 
put, we see and stop email threats that are missed by standard security 
controls before they do damage to an organization . 

If you really want to know the current state of email security, you have come 
to the right place . 

Let’s dive into the numbers.

2024 State of Email Security

OVER THE LAST YEAR, cybersecurity threats continued to increase, with email acting as the 
primary threat delivery mechanism for attacks. With this increase, the need for rapid and 
actionable intelligence is mission\-critical to protecting an organization from cyber criminals. 

Uniquely powered by more than 35 million Cofense\-trained employees, our phishing detection and 
response (PDR) solution detected a record\-setting number of malicious emails and phishing campaigns 
that were missed by secure email gateways (SEGs) . 

In just two years, Cofense PDR uncovered almost 800 thousand unique 
malicious email campaigns with over 1 .5 million emails detected worldwide . We 
have seen significant jumps in detected malicious emails year over year, and 
throughout the two years of data represented . Raw numbers of detected emails 
indicate 2023 had a 37% increase over 2022 and a 310% increase over 2021 .

ORGANIZATIONS CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE the power of simplicity when it comes 
to phishing attacks. While we often hear about highly advanced and devastating 
cyberattacks, the truth is that many of them start with basic phishing campaigns. 
These campaigns may seem unrelated to more sophisticated threats, but they can still 
serve as a gateway to serious breaches.

Email Security Trends to Watch – 
The Details

THE CYBERSECURITY LANDSCAPE IS ALWAYS EVOLVING, so it is imperative to stay on 
top of the latest trends and tactics. To learn more about what our intelligence revealed, 
here’s a deep dive into the email security trends you need to stay on top of in 2024\.

Credential Theft Phishing Leads 
as Top Threat Vector 

As we look to the future of cyber threats, it’s clear 

that credential phishing will remain a top concern . 

The Cofense team identified that 91% of active 

threat reports published in 2023 centered around 

credential phishing, a 67% increase in volume 

compared to the year prior .

This sophisticated form of attack often involves 

convincing individuals to give up their login 

information or other sensitive data, which can then be 

used to gain access to secure systems and networks . 

Cofense reported a 67% 
increase in credential 
theft phishing volume 
over 2022\.
Cofense Intelligence

Not only can credential phishing lead to devastating ransomware attacks and data breaches, but it can also pave the way for 

business email compromise (BEC) schemes that defraud companies out of millions of dollars . As we move into 2024 and beyond, 

organizations must take this threat seriously and work to implement robust security protocols that can protect against all forms 

of credential phishing like vishing, smishing, QR code phishing, and other dangerous cyber\-attacks .

Use of QR Codes in Phishing Campaigns 
is Rapidly Increasing

QR codes in the phishing threat landscape are a major topic of interest and worth 

paying close attention to . QR codes change the attack vector and enable threat 

actors to trick victims into using their smartphones, which are typically not protected 

by enterprise controls and are therefore more vulnerable . Over the last year, 

Cofense reported a 331% increase in QR code ATRs issued .

As campaigns using QR codes grow in size and complexity, it is important 

to track not just the QR codes themselves, but also the context of the emails 

QR codes in the phishing 
threat landscape are a 
major topic of interest 
and worth paying close 
attention to.

2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report • 10

delivering the QR codes. Some of the emails bearing QR codes are delivered in attached files 

like HTM, PDFs, or Word documents . Others use images embedded in the email or QR codes 

rendered from external sources . The more recent QR code campaigns utilize a wide range of 

email themes rather than the earlier campaigns that primarily used multi\-factor authentication 

as a lure for victims . 

• When it comes to the URLs from the actual QR codes, there are many different 

characteristics, such as their purpose as a legitimate redirect, a link shortener, etc . or the 

fact that one of the redirect pages makes use of a Cloudflare CAPTCHA.

• The most common characteristics associated with URLs embedded in QR codes were 

CAPTCHA, multi\-factor authentication (MFA), and URLs that had an open redirect to a 

credential phishing page .

• The most common sources of QR codes are either a code embedded in the email content or 

an attached .pdf, .htm, or .doc file. 

• The subject of QR code emails was likely to be MFA themed, containing date and personally 

identifiable information that was redacted.

• The types of URL domains embedded in QR codes were malicious or compromised, 

legitimate, QR code related, and a standard link shortener service .

• Legitimate domains of URLs embedded in QR codes were Bing, Google, Baidu, and 5 other 

minor sources .

Cofense 
reported 
a 331% 
increase in 
QR Code 
Active Threat 
Reports 
(ATRs) 
issued.
Cofense Intelligence

Cofense was the first to alert the market about this growing threat early in 2023 and in Q4 2023, announced a first\-of\-its\-kind 

solution that provides world\-class security awareness training (SAT) and threat detection \& response capabilities to specifically 

target QR code phishing threats .

Threat Actors Lure Victims with Brand 
Impersonation and Vishing Campaigns

Brand impersonation and vishing campaigns are techniques used by threat actors to deceive victims into clicking on malicious 

links or providing sensitive information . In brand impersonation attacks, cybercriminals use the name, logo, and other branding 

elements of a reputable company to trick victims into believing 

the communication is legitimate . Once they gain the trust of 

their victims, they exploit this relationship to carry out their 

malicious activities .

Vishing campaigns, on the other hand, often start with 

email but involve using voice calls or automated phone 

messages to manipulate victims into providing confidential 

information . The attackers may pose as representatives of 

a trusted organization or financial institution and use social 

engineering tactics to gain access to personal data such as 

login credentials or credit card numbers . Vishing attacks are 

becoming increasingly popular due to the ease of accessing 

personal information through phone numbers and the 

widespread use of smartphones .

Brand Impersonation: 
Cybercriminals use the name, logo, 

and other branding elements of a 
reputable company to trick victims into 
believing the communication is legitimate .

Vishing: Often start with email, 
and then voice calls or automated 

phone messages to manipulate victims 
into providing confidential information.

2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report • 11

Cofense saw both of these tactics on the rise in 2023\. Both vishing and brand impersonation tactics are very efficient at 

bypassing SEGs; they are often delivered without attachments or obvious links making it difficult for traditional file and text\-

based detection software to pick up on these forms of phishing . Additionally, because users interact with these tactics via 

non\-traditional methods like personal smartphones and traditional telephones, these types of phishing take users outside the 

protections of their corporate environment and its security protocols .

We believe that the best way to secure your organization from these types of attacks is to implement a 

complete end\-to\-end email security solution. We recommend a holistic solution that combines Security 

Awareness Training and Threat Detection and Response to identify malicious threats quickly and stop 

them before they become detrimental to your company’s data security while conditioning your employees to 

identify and report these types of malicious attacks. In 2023, Cofense introduced new simulation training to 

its SAT offering specifically focused on vishing and brand impersonation phishing tactics.

MALWARE FAMILY DarkGate and PikaBot

A malware phishing campaign that began spreading DarkGate malware in September 2023 evolved to become one of the most 

advanced phishing campaigns active in the threat landscape . Since then, the campaign has evolved and is using evasive tactics 

and anti\-analysis techniques to continue distributing DarkGate, and more recently, PikaBot malware . 

The campaign surged just one month after the last instance of QakBot activity and follows the same trends used by the 

infamous threat actors that deployed the QakBot malware and botnet . This campaign disseminates a high volume of emails 

to a wide range of industries, and due to the loader capabilities of the malware delivered, targets can be at risk of more 

sophisticated threats like reconnaissance malware and ransomware . 

2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report • 12

In August 2023, the FBI and the Justice Department 

announced they had disabled the QakBot infrastructure . Since 

then, QakBot has remained silent, with no significant activity 

seen from the malware infrastructure . While direct attribution 

between the QakBot threat actors and the new DarkGate 

campaign can be difficult, we can show the similarities between 

the two . At the time of this report, Cofense is watching this 

activity closely as there is a chance the threat actors are using 

this time to regroup and return even stronger in the future .

Starting with the timeline of the campaign, Cofense last 

reported on QakBot at the end of June, whereas DarkGate 

reports first emerged during July. The new campaign that is 

delivering DarkGate and PikaBot follows the same tactics that 

have been used in QakBot phishing campaigns . These include 

hijacked email threads as the initial infection, URLs with unique 

patterns that limit user access, and an infection chain nearly 

identical to what we have seen with QakBot delivery . The 

malware families used also follow suit to what we would expect 

QakBot affiliates to use. Along with many other capabilities, 

both malware families can act as loaders with the ability to add 

additional malicious payloads to unknown infected machines . 

DarkGate was first seen in 2018 
and is capable of cryptocurrency 

mining, credential theft, ransomware, and 
remote access .

PikaBot is a new malware family 
first seen in 2023\. It is classified as 

a loader due to its ability to deliver 
additional malware payloads . It contains 
several evasive techniques to avoid 
sandboxes, virtual machines, and other 
debugging techniques .

\*This data is based on Cofense Intelligence sightings .

The observed DarkGate/PikaBot campaign is a high\-level threat due to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that 

enable the phishing emails to reach intended targets and the advanced capabilities of the malware being delivered .

During the campaign, Cofense identified several different infection chains, almost as if the threat actors were testing different 

malware delivery options. A favored infection chain to deliver the malware has been identified and follows in line with that seen 

in QakBot campaigns during May 2023 .

2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report • 13

The campaign began with a hijacked email thread to bait users into interacting with a URL that had added layers that limited 

access to the malicious payload only to users that met specific requirements set by the threat actors (location and internet 

browser). This URL downloaded a ZIP archive that contained a JS file(JSDropper, which is a JavaScript application used to reach 

out to another URL to download and run malware) . At this stage, the user was successfully infected with either the DarkGate or 

PikaBot malware .

MALWARE FAMILY Emotet/Geodo

Emotet/Geodo may sound like names from a science fiction movie, but they represent one of the most destructive malware 

campaigns in recent years. This malware was first discovered in Europe in 2014, gained sophistication over time, and has spread 

across the globe, infecting countless computers and causing extensive damage to personal and professional networks . 

The FBI opened its first related investigation in 2017\. During 

their investigation, the FBI discovered that in some cases, 

malware was delivered as a banking trojan that recorded 

online banking credentials and then stole from victims’ 

accounts . In other cases, Emotet allowed the installation of 

malware that enabled a ransomware attack .

In 2021, law enforcement dismantled the foundational 

components of Emotet’s operation . The unprecedented effort 

closed off access that had been maliciously opened on 1 .6 

million computers worldwide .

Emotet was hit hard but like any other malicious campaign 

the threat actors always seem to live to see another day . Long 

gaps in Emotet activity are common, often followed by surges 

of malicious email dissemination . 

In 2023, Cofense researchers observed new activity in Emotet 

epochs 4 and 5 . Emotet uses several botnets called epochs, 

each of which is assigned its own command and control (C2\) 

infrastructure. In January, Cofense observed .dll file updates 

being sent to each epoch, almost certainly configuring bots to 

contact new infrastructure . 

Emotet, which is often partnered 
with Geodo, is known for its ability 

to infiltrate and manipulate email 
accounts, tricking unsuspecting individuals 
into downloading infected files or clicking 
on malicious links .

Geodo, on the other hand, operates 
as a botnet, creating a network of 

infected devices that work together to 
spread the virus even further . 

As predicted, after several months of inactivity, the Emotet botnet resumed email activity on March 7, 2023 . The malicious 

emails seemed to be replying to already existing email chains, with the addition of an attached .zip file. The .zip files are not 

password protected and the themes of the attached files included finances and invoices. 

Given its history of success, Emotet/Geodo poses a serious cybersecurity threat . We continue to encourage organizations to 

stay vigilant to avoid falling victim to this heinous threat .

MALWARE FAMILY Agent Tesla

The world of cybersecurity can be a daunting and complex place, especially when it comes to malware . One such malware 

is Agent Tesla, a keylogger written in .NET that can monitor keystrokes, take screenshots, steal passwords from a variety of 

applications, and exfiltrate this data back to the threat actor through common protocols, all while remaining undetected on the 

user’s computer . 

Agent Tesla first appeared in 2014 and has been a staple in the malware landscape ever since. This keylogger was originally 

advertised on a Turkish website as a remote access tool to monitor your personal computer . It could compile your passwords, 

2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report • 14

monitor your keystrokes, and avoid being caught by your 

endpoint’s anti\-virus . The Agent Tesla Keylogger executable 

is typically delivered via a direct attachment to an email . The 

chief exfiltration method over the past year remains SMTP but 

FTP, HTTP, Discord Webhooks, and Telegram are often seen 

as well .

Agent Tesla has gone through a variety of upgrades over 

the years . Besides changes intended to ensure that every 

new release can bypass anti\-virus scans, it now advertises 

the ability to steal credentials from over 55 applications 

including web browsers, VPN applications, FTP applications, 

and mail clients . It also continues to improve its ability to 

circumvent or avoid sandbox technologies. While at first 

it only used SMTP to communicate back to the attacker, it 

now also supports communication over FTP, HTTP, Discord 

Webhooks, and Telegram .

Agent Tesla can steal credentials 
from over 55 applications including 

web browsers, VPN applications, FTP 
applications and mail clients . Cofense has 
seen phishing emails delivering Agent 
Tesla through both attachments and links 
bypassing the leading secure email 
gateways (SEGs) .

Agent Tesla was originally sold as a remote access tool, and it could be argued that it functions no differently from legitimate 

remote access tools like GoToMyPC or LogMeIn . US prosecutors have successfully argued that someone selling and instructing 

users how to “install the product in ways that are arguably deceptive,” has crossed the legal line and can be criminally 

prosecuted under computer misuse laws . Other remote access tools have been sold in this manner and the sellers have been 

prosecuted and sent to prison . Some developers explicitly included warnings to “only use the product in a legal way” in an 

attempt to avoid prosecution but this was not held up in court .

Cofense has seen phishing emails delivering Agent Tesla through both attachments and links bypassing the leading SEGs . 

However, Agent Tesla keylogger’s behavior on an endpoint should typically be detectable by modern endpoint security suites 

and network activity monitors .

As cybercriminal techniques continue to evolve, it’s important to stay informed and take the necessary steps to safeguard your 

organization against these persistent threats . Cofense can help; our Phishing Detection and Response (PDR) solution is uniquely 

positioned to help you stop threats like these .

MALWARE FAMILY FormBook

FormBook consistently places in the Top 5 malware families most commonly seen by Cofense . FormBook is an information\-

stealer type malware, primarily focused on accessing information about infected computers, as well as saved credentials or 

forms from browsers, applications, cryptocurrency wallets, and instant messaging platforms . 

This malware is known to infect computer systems through malicious emails that trick unsuspecting users into opening it . Once installed, 

FormBook can steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details and browsing data without the victim’s knowledge .

FormBook is primarily focused on 
accessing information about 

infected computers, as well as saved 
credentials or forms from browsers, 
applications, cryptocurrency wallets, and 
instant messaging platforms .

It first appeared for sale in early 2016, and more recently it 

was updated and rebranded as XLoader in late 2020 . It’s 

simple, easy to use, has many capabilities, and is highly 

popular in the market .

FormBook has infected millions of computers worldwide . 

Its use is often seen in cybercrimes such as identity theft, 

blackmailing, and financial fraud. As such, both individuals 

and businesses must take proactive steps to safeguard their 

systems against this threat .

2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report • 15

MALWARE FAMILY Snake Keylogger

Snake Keylogger, a staple in the phishing threat landscape throughout 2021 and 2022, 

continues to pose a significant risk to individuals and organizations in 2023\. Snake Keylogger, 

a particularly dangerous threat written in .NET, is designed to secretly monitor and record 

every keystroke on a computer, including usernames and passwords, scan applications to steal 

saved credentials and exfiltrate this data through a variety of protocols delivering it back to the 

hackers to use or sell on the dark web . What makes the Snake Keylogger so concerning is its 

ability to evade detection by antivirus software and remain undetected on a target system for 

long periods of time .

Snake Keylogger made its first appearance in November 2020 and can still be purchased today 

for anywhere from $25 to $500 . Although it is not as popular as other malware families such as 

FormBook or Agent Tesla, it does maintain a significant presence and its usage is increasing.

Google AMP – 
A New, Evasive Phishing Tactic

A new phishing tactic utilizing Google Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) has hit the threat landscape and proven to be very 

successful at reaching intended targets. Google AMP is an open\-source HTML framework used to build websites that are 

optimized for both browser and mobile use . The websites that we observed in these campaigns are hosted on Google .com or 

Google .co .uk, both of which are considered trusted domains to most users . This phishing campaign not only employs Google 

AMP URLs to evade security but also incorporates a multitude of other TTPs known to be successful at bypassing email 

security infrastructure.

Cofense observed a 
1,092% increase in Google 
AMP emails bypassing 
SEGs in the last six 
months of 2023 compared

BEC – 
Costing Businesses Billions 

Although business email compromise (BEC) did not make it on our list of top trends to watch, it’s still a clear and present danger 

for organizations and worth mentioning . BEC remains one of the most devastating cybercrimes for the 8th consecutive year . 

With billions lost globally and victims in 90% of countries around the globe, we’ve seen scammers continue to exploit this type of 

crime with great success. While spam filters have transformed into malware detectors, they often fail to catch conversational\-

based phishing attacks, leading to billions of dollars being stolen year after year .

BEC is a subset of credential phishing but because of its popularity and successful track record, it is often talked about as a 

category of its own . By gaining access to an organization’s email account, scammers can perform man\-in\-the\-mailbox attacks . 

They create email forward rules to monitor all incoming and outgoing traffic. When they find an opportunity to redirect a 

transaction, they reply to the email thread with new information, often from a look\-alike domain or compromised infrastructure . 

By modifying invoices with new account details, scammers successfully reroute funds, making it difficult to reverse the 

transactions .

Two\-factor authentication (2FA) is a recommended defense against these attacks . However, scammers have found a way to 

bypass 2FA through an adversary\-in\-the\-middle technique, gaining access to users’ accounts by hijacking session cookies .

Another technique still flying under the radar is payroll diversion scams. Targeting human resources departments, threat actors 

manipulate financial records to redirect employees’ direct deposits. These attacks often go unreported and unnoticed, allowing 

scammers to continue their fraudulent activities .

Traditional defenses are no longer enough to protect against BEC attacks . Organizations must stay vigilant and implement robust 

security measures to safeguard their finances and sensitive information.
