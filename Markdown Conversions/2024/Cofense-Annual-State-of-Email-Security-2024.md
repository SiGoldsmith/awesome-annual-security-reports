IF YOU REALLY WANT 
TO KNOW THE CURRENT 
STATE OF EMAIL SECURITY, 
YOU HAVE COME TO THE 
RIGHT PLACE. 

2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report  •  2

# Introduction
Here’s the reality. 
In 2023, malicious email threats bypassing secure email gateways (SEGs) 
increased by more than 100%. In other words, your email security solutions 
aren’t stopping the threats you think they are. 

We know because: 
*   We are the only email security company with a global network of 35+ million 
trained employees reporting suspected threats around the clock 
*   Our proprietary data provides unmatched industry insights with a 
99.998% accuracy rate 
*   No one else has over a decade of insights and intelligence into the threats 
that EVERY SEG misses 
*   Last year we caught a malicious email EVERY MINUTE that bypassed our 
customers SEG 

Security threats are real, they continue to grow, and they are likely to 
penetrate an organization through email. Organizations simply cannot settle 
for ‘Good Enough’ email security and sole reliance on a SEG is not enough. As 
we all know, it only takes one breach to damage a company’s financial status, 
brand reputation, and/or relationship with its employees and customers. 

Each day, our analysts see thousands of threats that are bypassing all SEGs 
on the market.  
That’s exactly why Cofense® has spent the last decade perfecting our 
phishing expertise, growing our network of Cofense-trained employees 
around the globe, and setting ourselves apart from the competition – simply 
put, we see and stop email threats that are missed by standard security 
controls before they do damage to an organization. 

If you really want to know the current state of email security, you have come 
to the right place. 

Let’s dive into the numbers.

**32%**

 This year, credential phishing threats increased by 49% over 2022, which was already showing a large increase over 2021 
data. In 2023, credential phishing was responsible for 91% of active threat reports (ATRs) published, with malware lagging 
significantly behind. Based on this data, we conclude that credential phishing was the threat of choice in 2023.

 The top themes in ATRs remain similar to last year, with finance themes and notifications securing the top two spots at 
48% and 33% respectively. Cofense also saw a new theme, travel assistance, emerge. Travel assistance is a small contributor at 
2% but one to watch going forward.

ORGANIZATIONS CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE the power of simplicity when it comes 
to phishing attacks. While we often hear about highly advanced and devastating 
cyberattacks, the truth is that many of them start with basic phishing campaigns. 
These campaigns may seem unrelated to more sophisticated threats, but they can still 
serve as a gateway to serious breaches. 

2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report  •  10

# Email Security Trends to Watch –
## The Details
THE CYBERSECURITY LANDSCAPE IS ALWAYS EVOLVING, so it is imperative to stay on 
top of the latest trends and tactics. To learn more about what our intelligence revealed, 
here’s a deep dive into the email security trends you need to stay on top of in 2024.

### Credential Theft Phishing Leads 
#### as Top Threat Vector 
As we look to the future of cyber threats, it’s clear 
that credential phishing will remain a top concern. 
The Cofense team identified that 91% of active 
threat reports published in 2023 centered around 
credential phishing, a 67% increase in volume 
compared to the year prior.

This sophisticated form of attack often involves 
convincing individuals to give up their login 
information or other sensitive data, which can then be 
used to gain access to secure systems and networks. 
Not only can credential phishing lead to devastating ransomware attacks and data breaches, but it can also pave the way for 
business email compromise (BEC) schemes that defraud companies out of millions of dollars. As we move into 2024 and beyond, 
organizations must take this threat seriously and work to implement robust security protocols that can protect against all forms 
of credential phishing like vishing, smishing, QR code phishing, and other dangerous cyber-attacks.

### Use of QR Codes in Phishing Campaigns 
#### is Rapidly Increasing
QR codes in the phishing threat landscape are a major topic of interest and worth 
paying close attention to. QR codes change the attack vector and enable threat 
actors to trick victims into using their smartphones, which are typically not protected 
by enterprise controls and are therefore more vulnerable. Over the last year, 
Cofense reported a 331% increase in QR code ATRs issued.

As campaigns using QR codes grow in size and complexity, it is important 
to track not just the QR codes themselves, but also the context of the emails 
Cofense reported a 67% 
increase in credential 
theft phishing volume 
over 2022.

delivering the QR codes. Some of the emails bearing QR codes are delivered in attached files 
like HTM, PDFs, or Word documents. Others use images embedded in the email or QR codes 
rendered from external sources. The more recent QR code campaigns utilize a wide range of 
email themes rather than the earlier campaigns that primarily used multi-factor authentication 
as a lure for victims. 
*   When it comes to the URLs from the actual QR codes, there are many different 
characteristics, such as their purpose as a legitimate redirect, a link shortener, etc. or the 
fact that one of the redirect pages makes use of a Cloudflare CAPTCHA.
*   The most common characteristics associated with URLs embedded in QR codes were 
CAPTCHA, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and URLs that had an open redirect to a 
credential phishing page.
*   The most common sources of QR codes are either a code embedded in the email content or 
an attached .pdf, .htm, or .doc file. 
*   The subject of QR code emails was likely to be MFA themed, containing date and personally 
identifiable information that was redacted.
*   The types of URL domains embedded in QR codes were malicious or compromised, 
legitimate, QR code related, and a standard link shortener service.
*   Legitimate domains of URLs embedded in QR codes were Bing, Google, Baidu, and 5 other 
minor sources.

Cofense was the first to alert the market about this growing threat early in 2023 and in Q4 2023, announced a first-of-its-kind 
solution that provides world-class security awareness training (SAT) and threat detection & response capabilities to specifically 
target QR code phishing threats.

### Threat Actors Lure Victims with Brand 
#### Impersonation and Vishing Campaigns
Brand impersonation and vishing campaigns are techniques used by threat actors to deceive victims into clicking on malicious 
links or providing sensitive information. In brand impersonation attacks, cybercriminals use the name, logo, and other branding 
elements of a reputable company to trick victims into believing 
the communication is legitimate. Once they gain the trust of 
their victims, they exploit this relationship to carry out their 
malicious activities.

Vishing campaigns, on the other hand, often start with 
email but involve using voice calls or automated phone 
messages to manipulate victims into providing confidential 
information. The attackers may pose as representatives of 
a trusted organization or financial institution and use social 
engineering tactics to gain access to personal data such as 
login credentials or credit card numbers. Vishing attacks are 
becoming increasingly popular due to the ease of accessing 
personal information through phone numbers and the 
widespread use of smartphones.

**Brand Impersonation:** 
Cybercriminals use the name, logo, 
and other branding elements of a 
reputable company to trick victims into 
believing the communication is legitimate.

**Vishing:** Often start with email, 
and then voice calls or automated 
phone messages to manipulate victims 
into providing confidential information.

Cofense saw both of these tactics on the rise in 2023. Both vishing and brand impersonation tactics are very efficient at 
bypassing SEGs; they are often delivered without attachments or obvious links making it difficult for traditional file and text-
based detection software to pick up on these forms of phishing. Additionally, because users interact with these tactics via 
non-traditional methods like personal smartphones and traditional telephones, these types of phishing take users outside the 
protections of their corporate environment and its security protocols.

We believe that the best way to secure your organization from these types of attacks is to implement a 
complete end-to-end email security solution. We recommend a holistic solution that combines Security 
Awareness Training and Threat Detection and Response to identify malicious threats quickly and stop 
them before they become detrimental to your company’s data security while conditioning your employees to 
identify and report these types of malicious attacks. In 2023, Cofense introduced new simulation training to 
its SAT offering specifically focused on vishing and brand impersonation phishing tactics.

### Malware Tactics Continue to Evolve – 
#### Top Families to Watch
The following is a table showing the characteristics of different malware families. The table has the following columns: Malware Family, Information, Keylogging, Remote Access, Loader Capabilities, and Backdoor Controls. The rows are: Emotet/Geodo, FormBook, Agent Tesla, Snake, QakBot, DarkGate, and PikaBot. Each cell contains a checkmark or an x to indicate whether the malware family has the corresponding characteristic.

**Malware Characteristics**
| Malware Family | Information | Keylogging | Remote Access | Loader Capabilities | Backdoor Controls |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Emotet/Geodo | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| FormBook | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Agent Tesla | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Snake | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| QakBot | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| DarkGate | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| PikaBot | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |

#### MALWARE FAMILY
##### DarkGate and PikaBot
A malware phishing campaign that began spreading DarkGate malware in September 2023 evolved to become one of the most 
advanced phishing campaigns active in the threat landscape. Since then, the campaign has evolved and is using evasive tactics 
and anti-analysis techniques to continue distributing DarkGate, and more recently, PikaBot malware. 

The campaign surged just one month after the last instance of QakBot activity and follows the same trends used by the 
infamous threat actors that deployed the QakBot malware and botnet. This campaign disseminates a high volume of emails 
to a wide range of industries, and due to the loader capabilities of the malware delivered, targets can be at risk of more 
sophisticated threats like reconnaissance malware and ransomware. 

2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report  •  13

In August 2023, the FBI and the Justice Department 
announced they had disabled the QakBot infrastructure. Since 
then, QakBot has remained silent, with no significant activity 
seen from the malware infrastructure. While direct attribution 
between the QakBot threat actors and the new DarkGate 
campaign can be difficult, we can show the similarities between 
the two. At the time of this report, Cofense is watching this 
activity closely as there is a chance the threat actors are using 
this time to regroup and return even stronger in the future.

Starting with the timeline of the campaign, Cofense last 
reported on QakBot at the end of June,  whereas DarkGate 
reports first emerged during July. The new campaign that is 
delivering DarkGate and PikaBot follows the same tactics that 
have been used in QakBot phishing campaigns. These include 
hijacked email threads as the initial infection, URLs with unique 
patterns that limit user access, and an infection chain nearly 
identical to what we have seen with QakBot delivery. The 
malware families used also follow suit to what we would expect 
QakBot affiliates to use. Along with many other capabilities, 
both malware families can act as loaders with the ability to add 
additional malicious payloads to unknown infected machines. 

The following is a timeline showing the activity of Qakbot and DarkGate/PikaBot campaigns. The timeline starts in May 2023 and ends in October 2023. The timeline shows the following events: May 2023 - Last seen QakBot activity, June 2023 - FBI and Justice Department announce QakBot takedown, July 2023 - First sighting of the DarkGate campaign, August 2023 - Significant increase in volume for the DarkGate campaign, September 2023 - First sighting of PikaBot in the wild, October 2023 - DarkGate campaign swaps to PikaBot delivery.

*This data is based on Cofense Intelligence sightings.

The observed DarkGate/PikaBot campaign is a high-level threat due to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that 
enable the phishing emails to reach intended targets and the advanced capabilities of the malware being delivered.

During the campaign, Cofense identified several different infection chains, almost as if the threat actors were testing different 
malware delivery options. A favored infection chain to deliver the malware has been identified and follows in line with that seen 
in QakBot campaigns during May 2023.

**DarkGate** was first seen in 2018 
and is capable of cryptocurrency 
mining, credential theft, ransomware, and 
remote access.

**PikaBot** is a new malware family 
first seen in 2023. It is classified as 
a loader due to its ability to deliver 
additional malware payloads. It contains 
several evasive techniques to avoid 
sandboxes, virtual machines, and other 
debugging techniques.

2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report  •  14

The campaign began with a hijacked email thread to bait users into interacting with a URL that had added layers that limited 
access to the malicious payload only to users that met specific requirements set by the threat actors (location and internet 
browser). This URL downloaded a ZIP archive that contained a JS file(JSDropper, which is a JavaScript application used to reach 
out to another URL to download and run malware). At this stage, the user was successfully infected with either the DarkGate or 
PikaBot malware.

##### MALWARE FAMILY
##### Emotet/Geodo
Emotet/Geodo may sound like names from a science fiction movie, but they represent one of the most destructive malware 
campaigns in recent years. This malware was first discovered in Europe in 2014, gained sophistication over time, and has spread 
across the globe, infecting countless computers and causing extensive damage to personal and professional networks. 

The FBI opened its first related investigation in 2017. During 
their investigation, the FBI discovered that in some cases, 
malware was delivered as a banking trojan that recorded 
online banking credentials and then stole from victims’ 
accounts. In other cases, Emotet allowed the installation of 
malware that enabled a ransomware attack.

In 2021, law enforcement dismantled the foundational 
components of Emotet’s operation. The unprecedented effort 
closed off access that had been maliciously opened on 1.6 
million computers worldwide.

Emotet was hit hard but like any other malicious campaign 
the threat actors always seem to live to see another day. Long 
gaps in Emotet activity are common, often followed by surges 
of malicious email dissemination. 

In 2023, Cofense researchers observed new activity in Emotet 
epochs 4 and 5. Emotet uses several botnets called epochs, 
each of which is assigned its own command and control (C2) 
infrastructure. In January, Cofense observed .dll file updates 
being sent to each epoch, almost certainly configuring bots to 
contact new infrastructure. 

As predicted, after several months of inactivity, the Emotet botnet resumed email activity on March 7, 2023. The malicious 
emails seemed to be replying to already existing email chains, with the addition of an attached .zip file. The .zip files are not 
password protected and the themes of the attached files included finances and invoices. 

Given its history of success, Emotet/Geodo poses a serious cybersecurity threat. We continue to encourage organizations to 
stay vigilant to avoid falling victim to this heinous threat.

**Emotet**, which is often partnered 
with **Geodo**, is known for its ability 
to infiltrate and manipulate email 
accounts, tricking unsuspecting individuals 
into downloading infected files or clicking 
on malicious links.

**Geodo**, on the other hand, operates 
as a botnet, creating a network of 
infected devices that work together to 
spread the virus even further. 

##### MALWARE FAMILY
##### Agent Tesla
The world of cybersecurity can be a daunting and complex place, especially when it comes to malware. One such malware 
is Agent Tesla, a keylogger written in .NET that can monitor keystrokes, take screenshots, steal passwords from a variety of 
applications, and exfiltrate this data back to the threat actor through common protocols, all while remaining undetected on the 
user’s computer. 

Agent Tesla first appeared in 2014 and has been a staple in the malware landscape ever since. This keylogger was originally 
advertised on a Turkish website as a remote access tool to monitor your personal computer. It could compile your passwords, 
2024 Cofense Annual State of Email Security Report  •  15

monitor your keystrokes, and avoid being caught by your 
endpoint’s anti-virus. The Agent Tesla Keylogger executable 
is typically delivered via a direct attachment to an email. The 
chief exfiltration method over the past year remains SMTP but 
FTP, HTTP, Discord Webhooks, and Telegram are often seen 
as well.

Agent Tesla has gone through a variety of upgrades over 
the years. Besides changes intended to ensure that every 
new release can bypass anti-virus scans, it now advertises 
the ability to steal credentials from over 55 applications 
including web browsers, VPN applications, FTP applications, 
and mail clients. It also continues to improve its ability to 
circumvent or avoid sandbox technologies. While at first 
it only used SMTP to communicate back to the attacker, it 
now also supports communication over FTP, HTTP, Discord 
Webhooks, and Telegram.

Agent Tesla was originally sold as a remote access tool, and it could be argued that it functions no differently from legitimate 
remote access tools like GoToMyPC or LogMeIn. US prosecutors have successfully argued that someone selling and instructing 
users how to “install the product in ways that are arguably deceptive,” has crossed the legal line and can be criminally 
prosecuted under computer misuse laws. Other remote access tools have been sold in this manner and the sellers have been 
prosecuted and sent to prison. Some developers explicitly included warnings to “only use the product in a legal way” in an 
attempt to avoid prosecution but this was not held up in court.

Cofense has seen phishing emails delivering Agent Tesla through both attachments and links bypassing the leading SEGs. 
However, Agent Tesla keylogger’s behavior on an endpoint should typically be detectable by modern endpoint security suites 
and network activity monitors.

As cybercriminal techniques continue to evolve, it’s important to stay informed and take the necessary steps to safeguard your 
organization against these persistent threats. Cofense can help; our Phishing Detection and Response (PDR) solution is uniquely 
positioned to help you stop threats like these.

**Agent Tesla** can steal credentials 
from over 55 applications including 
web browsers, VPN applications, FTP 
applications and mail clients. Cofense has 
seen phishing emails delivering Agent 
Tesla through both attachments and links 
bypassing the leading secure email 
gateways (SEGs).

##### MALWARE FAMILY
##### FormBook
FormBook consistently places in the Top 5 malware families most commonly seen by Cofense. FormBook is an information-
stealer type malware, primarily focused on accessing information about infected computers, as well as saved credentials or
