## Foreword
Reflecting on the cyber security landscape of 2024, it is 
evident that the challenges organisations faced were 
unprecedented in scale and complexity. Last year was 
marked by a series of high-impact cyber incidents that 
tested the resilience of businesses and institutions 
worldwide. From crippling ransomware attacks to 
sophisticated nation-state espionage campaigns, the 
financial and operational repercussions underscored 
the urgent need for stronger defences and more 
strategic responses.  
This annual report provides a detailed analysis of 
the pivotal events that shaped the cyber security 
environment in 2024. By exploring key incidents—from 
the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities to global 
law enforcement efforts dismantling cybercriminal 
networks—we aim to equip organisations with the 
insights needed to fortify their operations against 
similar threats in the future.  
Looking to the future, the challenges posed by cyber 
threat actors are set to escalate, with consequences 
that may feel like science fiction but are all too real. 
Cybercriminals and nation-state actors are capitalising 
on the growing integration of technology into every 
aspect of our lives. This seamless connectivity, while 
transformative, presents attackers with increasing 
opportunities to disrupt systems, steal data, and create 
chaos at an unprecedented scale.  
Third-party compromises are expected to remain a 
critical concern. The next major breach could send 
devastating ripple effects across supply chains. In 
parallel, the rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) 
are giving rise to a new generation of cybercriminal 
tactics. With AI-driven tools, phishing schemes are 
becoming more convincing, while generative AI, 
deepfake technology, and advanced language models 
make detecting attacks significantly harder.  
Cloud vulnerabilities and insecure APIs continue to 
threaten sensitive business data and critical systems. 
A single misconfiguration in the cloud could expose 
entire networks, while poorly secured APIs remain 
an entry point for attackers to infiltrate systems. 
These persistent issues emphasise the importance of 
maintaining robust security hygiene in rapidly evolving 
technological environments.  
Meanwhile, the proliferation of Internet of Things 
(IoT) devices presents a mounting risk. From smart 
appliances to city-wide IoT systems, these devices often 
lack adequate security, making them prime targets 
for attackers. Cybercriminals have already hijacked 
IoT devices to build massive botnets, and as these 
technologies become integral to critical infrastructure, 
their potential to disrupt operations and expose 
sensitive data will only grow.  
Even ransomware —a long-standing cyber threat—
continues to evolve. While traditional attacks focused 
on encrypting data, many attackers now prioritise 
data theft, which is faster, easier, and more profitable. 
Stolen information can be leveraged for extortion, 
fraud, identity theft, or even future breaches, making 
it a highly valuable commodity in the hands of 
cybercriminals.  
The geopolitical dimension of cyber security also makes 
for an ever-changing threat landscape. Nation-state 
actors are intensifying their efforts to compromise 
critical infrastructure, including energy, healthcare, and 
telecommunications. Sophisticated campaigns, such 
as those by Volt Typhoon, have already highlighted the 
fragility of these sectors. The use of “pre-positioning”—
where adversaries covertly infiltrate systems in 
preparation for future sabotage or disruption—is a 
stark reminder of the hidden vulnerabilities that could 
be activated during times of geopolitical tension or 
conflict.  
In response to these threats, NCC Group remains 
committed to strengthening its threat intelligence 
capabilities. Through collaboration with international 
partners and leveraging cutting-edge technologies, 
we aim to help our clients not only understand the 
evolving threat landscape but also act decisively to 
mitigate risks.  
As we publish this report, the cyber security challenges 
ahead demand that businesses, governments, 
and individuals stay vigilant and proactive. By 
understanding the risks and acting today, we can 
collectively work towards a more secure digital future.
Thank you for your continued trust in us as we navigate 
these challenges together.
Sincerely, 
Matt Hull
Global Head of Threat Intelligence

# SECTION 1 Timeline of Critical Incidents
The timeline below provides insights into cyber 
incidents observed across 2024. This encompasses 
everything from ransomware attacks and 
nation-state targeting, to law enforcement and 
government activity.

**11/01/24**
The Cyber Security and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA), National Security 
Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) issued an advisory on 
Volt Typhoon, regarding their compromise 
of US critical infrastructure networks. The 
advisory highlighted that Volt Typhoon 
is pre-positioning itself on IT networks 
to enable disruptive or destructive 
cyberattacks in the event of a major crisis or 
conflict with the United States.
Volt Typhoon has targeted multiple 
critical infrastructure sectors, including 
Communications, Energy, Transportation 
Systems, and Water and Wastewater 
Systems, across the US and its territories, 
including Guam. The group’s activities 
are not consistent with traditional cyber 
espionage but instead are focused on 
enabling lateral movement to operational 
technology (OT) assets to disrupt functions.

**07/02/24**
Chinese threat actors, UNC5221, were 
suspected of exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities 
in Ivanti Connect Secure VPN and Ivanti Policy 
Secure gateway. CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-
2024-21887, affect all supported versions 
of the Ivanti Connect Secure VPN and Policy 
Secure Gateway. Their exploitation allows 
attackers to bypass authentication and execute 
arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. 
The nation-state group used advanced 
methods to maintain persistence and evade 
detection, including custom malware and 
deception of Ivanti’s Integrity Checker Tool.

**20/02/24**
Operation Cronos was initiated by the 
UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA), in 
collaboration with US and EU agencies, 
and aimed to dismantle the infrastructure 
supporting LockBit ransomware. The 
operation dismantled over 30 servers 
essential to LockBit’s infrastructure. This 
included servers to host malware and 
coordinate ransom negotiations, as well as 
vital backend systems. Authorities arrested 
multiple individuals from developers to 
affiliates who executed attacks. Seized 
decryption keys were distributed to victims, 
allowing them to recover data without 
paying ransoms.

**28/02/24**
Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of the 
UnitedHealth Group, suffered a significant 
ransomware attack by the ALPHV/
Blackcat group. The attackers claimed to 
have stolen 6 terabytes of sensitive data 
from the company. The breach disrupted 
Change Healthcare’s systems, which serve 
as a critical intermediary for medical and 
insurance data processing. Following 
the breach, the company engaged cyber 
security experts from Mandiant and Palo 
Alto to investigate the attack.

**05/03/24**
The personal information of up to 43 million 
citizens was compromised in a data breach 
at France Travail, a French government 
department responsible for assisting 
unemployed individuals. The breach exposed 
names, dates of birth, social security 
numbers, email addresses, postal addresses, 
and phone numbers. The incident, which 
occurred between February 6 and March 5, 
was investigated by the Cybercrime Brigade 
of the Paris Judicial Police Department.
The breach raised concerns about identity 
theft and fraud, as the stolen data could be 
linked to other breaches to create larger 
profiles on individuals. French citizens were 
advised to be vigilant against phishing 
attempts and ensure that their passwords 
are strong. This breach follows a previous 
incident last year that affected 10 million 
citizens and is considered the worst-ever 
data breach in France. The attack coincides 
with DDoS attacks on French government 
departments, claimed by the pro-Russia 
Anonymous Sudan group.

**06/04/24**
A major cyber incident targeted several 
key maritime ports and vessels, deploying 
sophisticated ransomware and malicious 
software that disrupted port operations 
and manipulated Automatic Identification 
Systems (AIS) on ships. This led to substantial 
delays, misrouted cargo, and increased risk of 
collisions.
The financial impact was severe, with estimated 
losses exceeding $500 million, including direct 
operational disruptions and indirect costs like 
insurance claims and ransom payments. Major 
ports in Europe, Asia, and North America, 
including the Port of Rotterdam and the Port of 
Singapore, experienced extensive delays and 
operational shutdowns.
Sensitive data, such as cargo manifests and 
crew details, were compromised, posing risks 
of identity theft and espionage. The incident 
highlighted the urgent need for enhanced cyber 
security measures in the maritime industry, 
which relies heavily on outdated systems and 
lacks robust cyber security protocols.

**02/05/24**
The healthcare communication platform 
ConnectOnCall experienced a significant 
data breach, compromising the personal 
information of 900,000 patients and 
healthcare providers. 
The breach involved unauthorised access 
to the platform between February 16 and 
May 12, 2024. Exposed data includes names, 
phone numbers, medical record numbers, 
dates of birth, and details related to health 
conditions, treatments, and prescriptions. 
ConnectOnCall promptly secured its 
systems, took the platform offline, and 
enlisted external cyber security specialists to 
investigate and enhance security measures.

**12/05/24**
Operation Endgame was a significant 
international effort led by France, Germany, 
and the Netherlands, supported by 
Eurojust. This also involved Denmark, the 
UK and US, as well as Armenia, Bulgaria, 
Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Switzerland, 
and Ukraine. The operation targeted botnet 
infrastructure used for deploying malware, 
including ransomware, affecting millions 
globally. 
Authorities disrupted over 100 servers and 
seized more than 2000 domains linked to 
malware distribution, particularly targeting 
“dropper” malware families like IceID, 
Smokeloaded, Pikabot, and Bumblebee. 
Endgame’s impact extended beyond the 
immediate takedown, with authorities 
arresting suspects in Ukraine and Armenia, 
and issuing arrest warrants for eight 
individuals in Germany.

**27/05/24**
The ransomware attack on Synnovis 
impacted healthcare services across multiple 
London hospitals. Synnovis provides 
essential pathology services to Guy’s and 
St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and 
King’s College Hospital NHS Trust, as well 
as general practitioners across six London 
boroughs. 
The attack disrupted IT systems that handle 
blood tests and other diagnostics, creating 
severe delays in patient care. As a result, 
critical incidents were declared in some 
hospitals due to resource strain, and some 
non-urgent procedures were cancelled or 
rescheduled. Blood transfusion systems 
were notably affected, with emergency 
protocols in place to reserve blood only for 
essential transfusions. 

**03/06/24**
The BlackSuit ransomware attack on CDK 
Global caused a massive disruption to 
car dealerships across North America, 
prompting a critical outage that forced CDK 
to shut down its IT systems. 
This resulted in dealerships being unable to 
process sales, manage inventory, or provide 
customer service, leading to significant 
operational challenges. CDK Global initiated 
negotiations with BlackSuit to avoid leaking 
data. The attack affected major dealership 
groups such as Penske Automotive and 
Sonic Automotive, which had to rely on 
manual operations.

**19/06/24**
The second phase of Operation Cronos 
involved intense international efforts, including 
sanctions and legal actions against key actors. 
Notably, a Russian national, identified as the 
developer and administrator of LockBit, was 
sanctioned by the United Kingdom, United 
States, and Australia. 
The sanctions, including asset freezes and 
travel bans, were imposed by the UK Foreign 
Commonwealth and Development offices, the 
US Department of the Treasury’s OFAC, and 
the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade. A US Indictment was unsealed 
against this individual for his role in LockBit’s 
creation.

**12/07/24**
AT&T reported a major data breach 
affecting the call and SMS logs of 
approximately 109 million customers. The 
breach targeted AT&T’s data stored on the 
Snowflake cloud platform, where attackers 
accessed logs from multiple timeframes. 
These logs contained metadata such as 
phone numbers, call durations, and cell 
sited IDs. The breach raised significant 
security concerns due to the sensitive 
nature of the communications data 
involved, despite the lack of direct personal 
identifiers. 
After discovering the breach, AT&T 
collaborated with the FBI and the US 
Department of Justice (DoJ) to delay public 
disclosure, citing potential risks to national 
security and public safety. 

**06/08/24**
The Texas-based UMC health system 
suffered a ransomware attack that 
severely impacted its operations. The 
incident led the hospital to temporarily 
shut down its IT system to prevent further 
compromise, which disrupted patient 
services and forced the diversion of 
emergency patients. 
Initially, many patients were rerouted, 
though the emergency center eventually 
resumed ambulance intake, with limited 
patient diversions still in place. UMC’s 
30 clinics across Texas and New Mexico 
remained operational, although certain 
services like radiology were impacted and 
required downtime.

**26/09/24**
The third phase of Operation Cronos 
targeting LockBit was coordinated by 
Europol, Eurojust, and law enforcement 
from 12 countries. This operation led to 
significant seizures and arrests. Key actions 
included the arrest of a suspected LockBit 
developer in France and two individuals in 
the UK linked to LockBit affiliates. Spanish 
authorities seized nine servers and arrested 
a hosting service administrator. 
Additionally, the US, UK, and Australia 
imposed sanctions on individuals tied 
to LockBit and Evil Corp. Europol’s Joint 
Cybercrime Action Taskforce played a 
central role, providing analytical support, 
crypto-tracing expertise, and coordinating 
technical operations.

**01/10/24**
The BidenCash marketplace leaked over 
1.2 million payment card details on a 
cybercrime forum. The leaked data included 
card numbers, expiration dates, CVV 
numbers, and other personal information, 
such as names and addresses. This leak 
was part of a promotional strategy by 
BidenCash to advertise their services. The 
compromised cards were primarily from the 
US, India, and Brazil.

**07/10/24**
Operation Magnus targeted two major 
infostealer malware families: RedLine 
and META. This operation was led by US 
agencies including the FBI and IRS Criminal 
Investigation, in partnership with Europol, 
Eurojust, and law enforcement in Belgium 
and the Netherlands. These infostealers 
capture sensitive data, such as login 
credentials, financial information, and 
cryptocurrency account details, which are 
then sold on dark web forums. 
The operation disrupted the infrastructure 
supporting these malware families, 
including seizing domains, servers, 
and telegram channels linked to their 
administrator. One of the key figures, 
Maxim Rudometov, a Russian national, was 
charged for his role in the development 
and operation of RedLine. He faces charges 
related to fraud and money laundering.

**28/10/24**
Operation Serengeti led by INTERPOL 
and AFRIPOL between September and 
October 2024, targeted cybercriminals 
across 19 African countries. The operation 
resulted in the arrest of 1,006 suspects 
and the dismantling of 134,089 malicious 
infrastructures. The operation focused 
on various cybercrimes, including 
ransomware, business email compromise 
(BEC), digital extortion, and online scams. 
It identified over 35,000 victims and linked 
cases to nearly $193 million in financial 
losses worldwide.

**31/10/24**
The FBI and CISA issued a joint statement 
revealing a cyber espionage campaign 
by the People's Republic of China (PRC) 
targeting commercial telecommunications 
infrastructure. PRC-affiliated actors 
compromised networks at multiple 
telecommunications companies, enabling 
the theft of customer call records, 
compromising private communications 
in government, and copying information 
subject to US law enforcement requests. 
The FBI and CISA have provided technical 
assistance, sharing information with 
potential victims, and working to strengthen 
cyber defences across the commercial 
communications sector. They encourage 
any organisation that believes it might be a 
victim to contact their local FBI Field Office 
or CISA. 

**13/11/24**
Ransomware targeted the Paris Olympics, 
affecting IT systems at the Reunion des 
Musees Nationaux, which manages nearly 
40 museums, including Olympic venues like 
the Grand Palais. Although the attackers 
encrypted some data and demanded a 
ransom, quick action by cyber security 
teams prevented significant disruptions to 
Olympic events. French authorities, aided 
by the pre-event security enhancements 
from the French cyber security agency, 
were prepared for such attacks and had 
implemented robust defenses, including 
penetration tests and awareness initiatives. 
The attack was one of over 68 attempted 
breaches recorded since the Olympic games 
started.

**01/12/24**
PIH Health faced a major disruption due 
to a ransomware attack that compromised 
part of its network. In response, the 
healthcare provider shut down its entire 
network as a precaution, affecting critical 
communication systems, including phone 
lines, voice messages and internet services 
across its hospital. 
PIH Health engaged third-party cyber 
forensic specialists to assist with the 
investigation and recovery efforts. The 
ransomware virus was isolated, and work 
is ongoing to securely restore affected 
systems.

**04/12/24**
Reports confirm a two-year campaign in 
which Russian cyber-espionage group 
Turla hijacked the infrastructure of the 
Pakistani threat actor Storm-0156 to 
conduct their own attacks. By taking over 
the Pakistani group’s servers, Turla was 
able to launch covert operations against 
already compromised targets, making their 
activities harder to detect. This tactic of 
hijacking other hackers' infrastructure is 
a sophisticated method that allows Turla 
to mask their operations and exploit the 
existing access and tools of other threat 
actors.

**04/12/24**
Law enforcement agencies successfully 
demolished sophisticated Russian money 
laundering networks in a large worldwide 
investigation known as "Operation 
Destabilise." The investigation focused on 
two major Russian-language networks, 
Smart and TGR, which facilitated the 
laundering of billions of dollars for 
cybercriminals, drug traffickers, and 
sanctioned Russian leaders. 
The operation resulted in 84 arrests, the 
confiscation of more than £20 million 
in cash and cryptocurrency, and the 
suspension of operations in 30 countries. 
The networks exploited bitcoin exchanges 
to transfer illicit payments without crossing 
physical borders, having a substantial 
influence on global cybercrime and money 
laundering activities.

**08/12/24**
Threat actors successfully hacked the 
US Treasury Department by exploiting 
a remote support platform used by the 
federal agency. According to a letter 
obtained by the New York Times, the 
incident has been attributed to a Chinese 
state-sponsored Advanced Persistent 
Threat (APT) actor. BeyondTrust's 
investigation revealed two zero-day 
vulnerabilities, CVE-2024-12356 and CVE-
2024-12686, which enabled the threat 
actors to breach and take control of 
Remote Support SaaS instances. 
As the Treasury Department was a 
customer of one of these compromised 
instances, the attackers were able to 
access agency computers and remotely 
steal documents.

**18/12/24**
Mark Sokolovsky, a 28-year-old Ukrainian 
national, has been sentenced to 60 months 
in federal prison for his role in operating the 
Raccoon Infostealer malware. Sokolovsky 
conspired to run Raccoon Infostealer as 
a malware-as-a-service (MaaS), allowing 
cybercriminals to lease access to the 
malware for approximately $200 per month, 
paid in cryptocurrency. This malware was 
used to steal personal data, including login 
credentials and financial information, 
then used for financial crimes or sold on 
cybercrime forums.

**25/12/24**
4.45GB of data leaked from Cisco’s DevHub 
platform, following an earlier breach in 
October. This incident was caused by a 
misconfiguration that made certain files 
publicly accessible. The leaked data, posted 
online by the hacker known as IntelBroker, 
included Java binaries, source code, 
cloud server disk images, cryptographic 
signatures, and internal project archives. 
Cisco emphasised that its internal systems 
and enterprise environments remain 
secure, and that no sensitive customer 
information such as personally identifiable 
information (PII) or financial data was 
exposed. The company has since corrected 
the configuration error and enhanced 
its security measures to prevent similar 
incidents in the future.

# SECTION 3 Ransomware Statistical Trends 2024
2024 saw a major shift in the number of attacks per 
month within the ransomware threat landscape. 5263 
attacks were recorded, an increase of 15% from 2023. 
This surge was particularly noticeable in the latter half 
of 2024, with November and December experiencing 
the highest monthly attacks, 565 and 574 respectively. 
This differs from previous observations in which 
December normally sees a decrease in ransomware 
attacks around the holiday season.
All regions experienced an increase in ransomware 
attacks in 2024. North America remains the most 
targeted region with 2869 attacks, up 25% from 2023. 
Asia observed 571 attacks, a 23% increase from 2023, 
and South America 276, an increase of 29%. Europe, 
Oceania and Africa saw modest increases alike, which 
are further detailed in the regional section below.
LockBit remained the most prominent threat actor of 
the year, although the group’s activity declined from 
1034 attacks in 2023 down to 526 in 2024. New actors 
such as RansomHub rose up the rankings, contributing 
to the overall increase in attacks. Other notable actors 
like Play and Akira saw an increase in their activity, with 
Akira nearly doubling their attacks from 164 in 2023 
to 303 in 2024. Lastly, Funksec, a new group which 
emerged as the top threat actor for December 2024, 
will be one to watch in 2025.
Several factors contributed to the increase in 
ransomware attacks in 2024, in which exploited 
vulnerabilities and compromised credentials were 
among the top causes. In addition, geopolitical tensions 
heightened the risk of ransomware being used as 
a tool to achieve political goals. Moreover, attacks 
have become more profitable due to increasing 
cryptocurrency values further escalating these threats. 
A rise in Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) platforms 
has also made it easier for attackers to launch attacks, 
whilst law enforcement action led to the emergence 
of new threat actors. In 2023, we recorded 62 threat 
actors which increased to 94 in 2024.

### Industrials Remains the Top Ransomed Sector
The industrials’ sector was the most targeted, up from 
1240 attacks in 2023 to 1424 in 2024, an increase of 
15%. This sector is a key component of the global 
economy, making it a prime target for threat actors. 
The attacks on the sector have been disruptive, 
affecting critical infrastructure and causing significant 
operational downtime.
Many industrial organisations still rely on legacy 
systems that may not be adequately updated 
or patched. These outdated systems often have 
vulnerabilities which threat actors exploit to gain 
information or infiltrate the system and drop 
ransomware programs. Fog ransomware was observed 
to be targeting virtual environments and backup 
systems that are critical to industrial operations. It can 
encrypt machine files and delete backups to disrupt 
operational continuity. Helldown also leveraged tools 
from LockBit’s leaked builder to actively target the 
manufacturing sector and proceed with dual extortion 
tactics.[^1]

[^1]: Source needed for Fog ransomware and Helldown claims.

In addition to vulnerabilities posed by legacy systems, 
the convergence of Operational Technology (OT) and 
Information Technology (IT) in industrial environments 
has expanded the attack surface.[^2] While IT systems 
are typically more secure, OT systems may lack the 
same level of protection which provides an entry point 
for various threat actors specialising in the sector. 

[^2]: Source needed for OT/IT convergence claim.

For instance, BlackSuit, formerly known as Royal, 
rebranded and enhanced its capabilities to target 
industrial organisations more effectively to cause 
significant operational disruption. Furthermore, the 
sector’s reliance on interconnected supply chains 
makes it particularly vulnerable to ransomware attacks, 
in which one successful attack can have a cascading 
effect on others within the supply chain, significantly 
increasing its impact.
The industrial sector must acknowledge the changing 
landscape of cyber threats and take proactive 
measures to protect its operations. Organisations 
can better fight against sophisticated threats by 
investing in legacy system modernisation, enhanced 
cyber security measures, and employee training. This 
comprehensive approach will reduce the dangers 
posed by ransomware and other cyberattacks, assuring 
the resilience and continuation of vital industrial 
operations.

### RansomHub Becomes the Most Active Threat Actor
RansomHub emerged as the most active threat actor 
following the attempted takedown of LockBit 3.0. Early 
in H1 2024, LockBit continued to be the dominant 
player within the ransomware landscape. However, law 
enforcement operations, notably Operation Cronos, 
which took down their infrastructure and revealed the 
identity of their lead operator, caused a significant drop 
in activity by the end of H2 2024.[^3]

[^3]: Source needed for LockBit takedown and operator reveal.

These efforts opened a vacuum in the ransomware 
landscape which caused many affiliates to either 
find another operator or create their own variant. 
RansomHub emerged as a top destination for high 
level affiliates of LockBit and ALPHV. 
Descended from previously prominent variants like 
Knight and Cyclops, RansomHub’s reputation and 
technical expertise opened the door for experienced 
LockBit affiliates to begin conducting attacks with 
RansomHub.[^4]

[^4]: Source needed for RansomHub lineage and affiliate migration.

This trend is reflected by the data in H1 2024, where 
LockBit held 433 victims compared to RansomHub 
with 123. In H2 2024, RansomHub numbers grew to 
378 victims, surpassing LockBit with only 93. These 
numbers follow law enforcements’ efforts against 
LockBit, likely influencing the decline. Equally, the 
authenticity of these numbers remains in question, 
where it is suspected LockBit artificially inflated their 
numbers following the takedown.  
Overall, RansomHub’s emergence can be attributed 
to the dynamic between RaaS and law enforcement 
operations. Targeting major players has forced 
affiliates to find the next best operator who can provide 
them with the best software and commission. 
This trend is expected to continue with increased 
activity by major RaaS operators like RansomHub, along 
with the emergence of more variants. Law enforcement 
operations will continue; however, affiliates will create 
or join other ransomware operators where major 
players are targeted. 

### Regional Ransomware Trends
North America (2689 attacks) and the European Union 
(1272 attacks) continued to see the greatest number of 
attacks, in line with our observations since 2021. 
The data also indicated a 23% rise in attacks in Asia, 
a 29% increase in South America, and a 22% uptick 
in Oceania, when compared to 2023. High payouts, 
geopolitical pressures, and a thriving RaaS ecosystem 
are potential factors which explain the multi-regional 
increase.
2024 was on pace to be a record year for ransom 
payments, further buoyed by increasing cryptocurrency 
values.[^5] 2024 also saw a record $75 million ransom 
payment to the Dark Angels group. The financial 
incentive to conduct attacks has drawn in more 
operators and affiliates who look to increase their 
operations on a global scale. Moreover, organisations 
in Asia, South America, and Oceania have also been 
undergoing rapid digitisation, increasing the risk of 
threat actors looking to exploit weak cyber security 
measures.
Geopolitical factors are also likely at play. States such 
as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), 
who invest significantly into financially motivated 
cybercrime, made over $1.34 billion, a 103% increase 
from 2023’s $660.50 million.[^6] Moreover, the Russia-
Ukraine war and tensions in the South China Sea 
have placed organisations in the crossfire of threat 
actors, blurring the lines between state-sponsored 
and criminal activities.[^7] Ransomware operators can be 
leveraged as a geopolitical tool by targeting CNI and 
simultaneously funding regimes, whilst averting kinetic 
military operations.[^8]

The increased number of ransomware operators, 
and possibly affiliates, has created a thriving RaaS 
ecosystem allowing threat actors to increase attack 
volume on organisations outside of the EU and 
NA. High payouts and nation-states who support 
ransomware operations against geopolitical 
competitors have allowed ransomware threat actors 
to enjoy an environment with more sophisticated 
resources. This has also lowered their risk of being 
apprehended.

### Conclusion
In 2025, we expect to see a continued increase in attack 
numbers, in line with the incline observed since 2021. 
Attacks are highly likely to be directed at sectors like 
industrials, who have historically been vulnerable to 
ransomware attacks. Law enforcement operations 
will continue to target major operators. However, the 
thriving RaaS ecosystem will allow affiliates to easily 
change their operator and continue conducting attacks 
under a different ransom group name. Growing use 
of AI and machine learning to assist with attacks, and 
defence strategies will significantly reshape the cyber 
security landscape. Basic security foundations must be 
implemented by organisations to ensure a proactive 
defence against ransomware. Integrating technological 
and automated solutions alike, such as AI-assisted 
measures, should also be considered to facilitate the 
process where possible.
