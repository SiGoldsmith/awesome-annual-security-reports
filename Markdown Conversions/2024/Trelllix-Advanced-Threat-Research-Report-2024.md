another organization in your industry. 

The cybersecurity race to outpace attackers and stop 
them from using legitimate security tools for bad is 
getting more complicated. 

As CISO, you have to move with agility, speed, 
confidence and control. Your CEO and Board are 
waiting to know more about your logging and alert 
tools. You task your team to identify gaps, and you 
have a plan to address them. 

The cybersecurity race is a triathlon. You’re competing 
in SecOps, Technology and Intelligence. The race is on, 
and it’s a game of endurance. 

As defense mechanisms become more 
sophisticated, so too do the offensive 
tools and tactics nation\-state and cyber 
criminal actors.

FORWARD

Operational threat intelligence and the ability to add context for your 
environment to global threats has never been more important to the 
role of the CISO. 

As we’re tasked to do more with less, CISOs and their SecOps teams 
require threat intelligence to anticipate threats, identify and prepare for 
the most relevant threats targeting your organization, align programs 
and budget against the most likely threats and actors, and finally, to 
move from a reactive to proactive posture. 

As “Customer Zero” for Trellix, I have never seen more potential for 
intelligence to shape the way responders move and strategize. 

Take this content, digest it, and put it to use in your strategic planning, 
budget rationalization, board education and operational support. 
I hope this insight is educational, informative and beneficial, and acts as 
a stepping stone to better guide and influence how you plan, prepare, 
and persist against APTs.

With this report, and all of our reports, we aim to provide structure 
around intelligence and context to what we’re observing. 

The landscape

The last six months have been unprecedented \- a state of polycrisis 
remains and it has accelerated cybercriminal and threat actor activity 
globally. We’re seeing radical shifts in behavior, including: 

  The ransomware ecosystem is a\-typical following law 

enforcement action,

  Autonomous groups are selling their wares in penetration testing 

and alternative attack methods to ransomware gangs,

  Warfare in Israel has triggered direct state\-sponsored attacks and 

hacktivism, and 

  Threat actors are looking to be more sophisticated, and they have 

access to cheap and free GenAI\-based tools that empower them to 
become experts overnight, and

A cat and mouse game

With larger implementation of endpoint detection and response (EDR) 
solutions, we’re seeing the cat and mouse game of cybersecurity get 
more complex. The increase of threat actors using criminal tools to 
dismantle EDR has piqued our interest and is a sharp course change 
from the use of traditional malware\-based tools. 

As defenders, we have to change course, too. EDR has proven effective 
at detecting malware, ransomware and the activity of APT groups, 
but if EDR is taken offline, what’s an organization and their CISO to 
do? You need logging, you need alerting, and you need operational 
threat intelligence to keep from being blind to unusual behavior in your 
system. There’s a new layer of gameplay. 

We work diligently to share threat intelligence with the community \- a 
core value of ours to keep ahead of adversaries \- and track campaigns 
and threat groups at scale.

The landscape is shifting more than ever. Our aim is to support our 
customers and the industry at large with the intelligence needed to 
sharpen defenses, make countermeasures, and identify gaps. 

In this cat and mouse game, we have to play to win.

INTRODUCTION: THE CYBERTHREAT REPORT: JUNE 2024

Geopolitical Events Impacting the Cyber Domain 

Research from the Trellix Advanced Research Center into activity 
from October 1, 2023 \- March 31, 2024 has revealed a shift in threat 
activities, with a noticeable increase in geopolitically motivated 
cyber threat operations. Notably, major regional and global events 
– such as military exercises, political or economic summits, political 
conventions, and elections – drove cyber threat activities. 

Trellix analysts assess with moderate confidence that threat actors 
focused on these events to collect relevant intelligence about 
counterparts, probe networks proactively to obtain information for 
situational awareness, or preposition on IT networks strategically for 
future attacks.

  Presidents Biden and Xi meet in San Francisco: In November 
2023, Trellix telemetry detection data indicated an uptick in 
malicious activity from China\-associated APT actor groups only 
days before the meeting between U.S. President Biden and 
China’s President Xi in San Francisco as part of the Asia\-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting. The number of threat 
activities decreased significantly following the Biden\-Xi summit 
and throughout the APEC summit. 

As the APEC summit came to an end, the level of threat activity 
fell to its lowest point in the month of November 2023\. This 
pattern of threat activity from China\-associated threat actor 
groups likely suggests that China’s state\-sponsored threat actor 
groups were heavily influenced by geopolitical events such as 
APEC. It may also indicate that China’s APT groups may have 
deliberately withdrawn their hacking activity during a major 
political event possibly to preserve their public image and 
international reputation. 

  Israel\-Hamas war: Threats from Iranian\-linked APT threat 

actor groups have also been driven by political developments 
surrounding the Israel\-Hamas war. In the United States, Trellix 
global telemetry data shows periodic surges of malicious activity 
from Iranian\-linked APT threat actor groups in the last six 
months (with the exception of late November and December 
2023\). Specifically, our global telemetry shows a reduction in 
threat activity from Iranian\-linked APT groups targeting U.S. 
organizations during the periods of Israel hostage exchange and 
ceasefire agreements in late November 2023 and December 
2023, when the U.S. pushed for a humanitarian ceasefire in the 
Gaza Strip as Iran is an open supporter of Hamas. Additionally, 
Trellix global telemetry indicates that Iranian\-linked APT threat 
actor groups has employed a variety of TTPs, including phishing, 
information stealer, backdoors, downloader, malicious webshells, 
and commonly exploited vulnerabilities to target organizations in 
Israel during the reporting period.

  Military drills: In addition, multinational military exercises to 
enhance combat readiness can trigger increased malicious 
activities. Most recently, in March 2024, Trellix global telemetry 
data shows repeated surges in threat activities in South Korea 
during the U.S.\-South Korean large\-scale joint military exercises, 
known as Freedom Shield, from March 4 to March 14, 2024\. 
These military drills are designed to reflect the “Korea Theater of 
Operations” and counter North Korea’s evolving nuclear threat. 
Specifically, threat detections in South Korea exceeded over 
150,000 detections on March 7 and March 13, 2024, respectively, 
which is around seven times the usual 20,000 daily detections 
in the country. 

  Russia\-Ukraine war: Continued kinetic warfare in the region 

has been accompanied by cyber initiatives large and small. Most 
notably, Russian\-linked actors have been observed leveraging 
new and more advanced wiper malware to wipe thousands of 
virtual servers and PCs by attacking Ukrainian telecom provider 
Kyivstar. The attack to KyivStar is one of the highest\-impact 
disruptive cyberattacks on Ukraine since Russia invaded the 
country in 2022\.

Highlights At\-a\-Glance

While this report serves as a repository for research from across our 
business, key themes persist:

1\. Rapid and Significant Changes in the APT Landscape

a. Russia\-Linked Sandworm Escalates: As geopolitical tensions 
rise, so does APT activity across the entire ecosystem. While 
APT threats grow overall, Russia\-linked Sandworm Team was 
detected 40% more in the period observed in this report. 

b. China Remains Prolific: China\-linked threat groups 

remain the most prolific originator of APT activities with 
Trellix observing more than 21 million detections of threat 
activities from China\-aligned threat actor groups. Over 23% 
of the detections of malicious activities are directed at the 
government sector worldwide.

c. VoltTyphoon Activity Spikes: As a relatively new China state\-
sponsored APT group, Volt Typhoon stands out because of its 
unique behavior pattern and targeting practices. Since mid\-
January 2024, Trellix telemetry detected over 7,100 malicious 
activities associated with Volt Typhoon, with periodic spikes 
throughout the period from January through March 2024\.

2\. LockBit Shakes Up Ransomware Ecosystem

a. Imposters Impact Gang Reputation: Following a 

global law enforcement action, Operation Cronos, Trellix 
observed imposters pretending to be LockBit, all while 
the group frantically tried to save face and restore the 
lucrative operation. 

b. U.S. Remains Most Targeted: The United States remained 
the most targeted by ransomware groups, followed by 
Turkey, Hongkong, India and Brazil.

c. Transportation and Shipping Most Hit: Ransomware actors 
threatened the transportation and shipping sector the most 
in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024\. The sector generated 53% and 45% 
of global ransomware detections, respectively, and was 
followed by the finance industry. 

d. Law Enforcement Action Leads to Sentencing: Before 

finalizing this report, global law enforcement disclosed the 
true identity of LockBit’s ring leader. Further action against 
ransomware criminals took place on May 1st. The REvil 
affiliate that attacked Kayesa and many other organizations 
was sentenced to 13 years in prison and repayment of 
$16 million USD.

3\. EDR Killers Emerge 

a. D0nut Ransomware Gang Appears: The emergence of 

the D0nut ransomware gang was particularly noteworthy 
for their innovative use of an EDR killer tool, showcasing 
an advanced tactic to circumvent endpoint detection and 
enhance the effectiveness of their attacks.

b. Spyboy’s EDR Evasion Tool Used to Target Telecom: A EDR 
“killer” tool by developer Spyboy called “Terminator” was 
used in a new campaign in January 2024\. The tool is used 
to circumvent EDR solutions, and 80% of detections were 
targeted at the telecom sector. 

4\. U.S. Presidential Election Themed Scams

a. Phishing Remains Ripe: As the world looks to see the 

outcome of November’s presidential election in the U.S., 
scams leveraging election imagery and curated to secure 
donations have been observed.

5\. GenAI and the Cybercriminal Underground

a. Free AI\-Powered Tools: Trellix observed a free ChatGPT 

4\.0 Jabber tool available in the cybercriminal underground, 
which both allows the developer to enable threat actors 
to adopt GenAI into their operations and to create a GenAI 
knowledge base to learn from other cyber criminals or even 
steal their ideas and tools. 

b. InfoStealer Adoption Rises: Two InfoStealers with GenAI\-

based features were observed to be used by cybercriminals. 
MetaStealer and LummaStealer are equipped with GenAI to 
evade detection and to detect bots among the list of logs, 
respectively. GenAI capabilities make these criminal tactics 
harder to find and harder to stop.

REPORT ANALYSIS, INSIGHTS, AND DATA 

Nation States and Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) 

From October 2023 through March 2024, Trellix observed a 17% 
increase in APT\-backed detections compared to the previous six 
months. This is notable as our last report identified a staggering 50% 
increase in these detections. The APT ecosystem is fundamentally 
different from a year ago – more aggressive, cunning and active. 

In the rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape, Advanced Persistent 
Threat (APT) groups continue to pose a significant and sophisticated 
challenge to global cybersecurity.

We aim to thoroughly analyze activities associated with Advanced 
Persistent Threats (APT) detected from Q4 2023 through Q1 2024\. 
This analysis focuses on the origins of these threats, their main 
targets, and the tools used in their operations. We compare these 
findings to data from the first half of 2023 (Q2 to Q3\) using two key 
metrics: percentage variance and proportional contribution variance.

  Percentage variance: This metric helps us see if the activity of a 
specific APT group, the targeting of certain countries, or the use 
of particular tools has gone up, gone down, or stayed the same 
over time. Understanding this helps us track how the behaviors of 
these threat actors change and how the overall landscape of cyber 
threats is evolving.

  Proportional contribution variance: This metric adds context by

not just showing the raw change in activity, but how this change 
stands against the backdrop of the entire cybersecurity threat 
environment. For example, even if detections of a particular actor 
have increased significantly, this might still represent a small part of 
the total cyber threats if the overall threat environment has become 
much busier. Conversely, if their detections have decreased, but the 
rest of the threat environment has slowed down even more, this 
actor could be becoming relatively more significant.

By employing these metrics, we aim to provide a nuanced 
understanding of the shifts in APT activities, enabling us to draw 
insights into their strategic objectives, preferred methodologies, 
and the cybersecurity challenges they pose. The following sections 
delve into these findings, shedding light on the intricate world of 
APTs and the continuous efforts required to safeguard against their 
sophisticated threats.

  Shift in tactics: Sandworm Team, historically known for its 

TABLE OF CONTENTS

disruptive cyber operations, has seen a staggering increase in 
detections by 1669%, with a proportional contribution variance 
of 40%. This monumental rise suggests an unprecedented 
escalation in their cyber activities from the Russia\-linked group.

  Aggressive expansion of operations: APT29, a group with 

a history of extensive cyber espionage, showed a significant 
uptick in activity, with detections increasing by 124%. Similarly, 
APT34 and Covellite also demonstrated substantial increases in 
detections, by 97% and 85% respectively, indicating heightened 
operational tempos or the initiation of new campaigns.

  Homeostasis: In contrast, groups like Mustang Panda, Turla, and 
APT28 saw minimal changes in their activity levels, with Mustang 
Panda showing a slight decrease of \-2% and Turla a modest 
increase of 3% in detections. 

  New actors emerge: Noteworthy is the emergence of UNC4698, 
which saw a 363% increase in detections, suggesting the rise of a 
potentially significant new player in the APT landscape.

WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT UNC4698?

Not a lot is known about this group, but researchers have been 
able to recognize their behavior as group activity and don’t know 
yet how to attribute it.

Having said that, what is known about UNC4698 is that its focus 
is on industrial espionage, gathering sensitive operational data 
which could be used to support economic or national security 
objectives of the sponsoring state, presumably linked to China 
due to the nature and regional focus of the attacks.

Its usual targets are oil and gas organizations in Asia.

They are also known to employ a specific malware that goes by 
the name of ‘SNOWYDRIVE’.

UNC4698 employs a variety of tactics, techniques, and 
procedures (TTPs) centered around the use of malware delivered 
via USB flash drives. Here are some key TTPs associated with this 
threat actor:

  Initial Access via Infected USB Devices: The primary 
method of infection involves USB drives that contain 
malicious software designed to create a backdoor on the 
host system.

WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT UNC4698? 

  Execution through Malicious Files: The malware typically 
includes a dropper that writes malicious executables and 
DLLs to disk. These files often masquerade as legitimate 
software to avoid detection and are executed to establish 
further control.

  Persistence and Registry Modification: UNC4698 

ensures persistence on the infected systems by modifying 
the Windows registry. This allows the malware to start 
automatically whenever the system boots up.

  Command and Control (C2\) Communication: The malware 
sets up a method for remote communication, allowing the 
attackers to issue commands and control the compromised 
systems from afar.

  Lateral Movement via Removable Media: The malware 
can copy itself to other USB devices connected to the 
infected machine, which helps in spreading the infection 
to other systems.

Lesser\-known or unidentified groups, saw a 62% increase in 
detections, indicating a diverse and growing array of threats beyond 
the well\-documented APT entities. This increase of 8% in their 
proportional contribution to the total detections highlights the 
constant evolution and diversification of cyber threats.

When looking at countries of origin, 
Trellix telemetry from October 2023 
through March 2024 also observed 
notable shifts in the landscape 
of state\-sponsored cyber activities. 

China\-linked threat groups 

remain the most prolific 

originator of APT activities

  Substantial escalation in 
operations: Geopolitical 
motivations and cybersecurity capabilities are evolving across 
different nations. Our telemetry observed the following: 

a. Russia\-linked threat groups have shown a significant 

increase in APT detections, up by 31%, with its proportional 
contribution rising by 4%. This indicates a substantial 
escalation in cyber operations, possibly reflecting 
broader strategic objectives or responses to global 
cybersecurity dynamics.

b. Iran\-linked threat groups have also markedly ramped up 
cyber activities, with an 8% increase in detections and a 
3\.89% rise in proportional contribution. This highlights a 
significant expansion in Iran’s cyber operations, in line with its 
geopolitical aims and involvement in the Israeli\-Hamas war.

  Broader diversification: China remains the most prolific 

originator of APT activities, with detections slightly increasing 
by 1%. However, its proportional contribution to the overall 
detections has seen a slight decrease of \-1%, which might 
suggest a broader diversification of APT origins during this 
period. February of this year also saw reports of significant efforts 
from China\-backed APT Volt Typhoon targeting U.S. critical 
infrastructure; more on this in the following section. 

  Shift in strategy: Conversely, groups linked to North Korea, 
Vietnam, and India have seen dramatic decreases in their 
APT activities, with North Korea\-linked detections dropping 
by \-82%, Vietnam by \-80%, and India by \-82%. The significant 
downturn in North Korea’s proportional contribution (\-6%) is 
particularly notable, possibly indicating a shift in focus, strategy, 
or capabilities.

  More countries emerging: Pakistan\-linked and Belarus\-linked 
groups have seen considerable increases in their APT activities, 
with detections up by 55% and an astonishing 2019%, respectively. 
These increases, particularly the exponential rise associated 
with Belarus, underscore the emergence of new or previously 
underrecognized actors in the APT arena. 

The category of “Other” shows a 121% increase in detections, 
indicating that APT activities are not limited to the most 
frequently cited countries. This diversity highlights the global 
nature of cyber threats and the necessity for a wide\-ranging and 
adaptive cybersecurity posture. 

We will be tracking these new patterns closely in the months ahead.

Targeted Countries and Regions 

This section focuses on the countries regions where Trellix detected 
APT related activity by APT groups from Q4 of 2023 through Q1 of 
2024, revealing significant shifts in focus and strategy among these 
sophisticated cyber actors. 

The data underscores the global nature 
of cyber threats and the varying levels 
of attention different nations receive 
from APT groups.

The Trellix Advanced Research Center 
assesses with a moderate level 
of confidence that the following factors 
impacted activity detected in certain 
countries and regions

Turkey has seen an 
unprecedented surge in 

APT\-related detections

Operational objectives: 
Detections in threats targeting Turkey 
increased by a staggering 1458%, translating to a 16% rise in its 
proportional contribution to the total detections. This remarkable 
increase indicates a significant shift in cyber threat focus towards 
Turkey, possibly reflecting broader geopolitical tensions or specific 
operational objectives of the APT groups. 

  Strategic importance: India and Italy have also experienced 

considerable increases in detections, with detections up by 614% 
and 308%, respectively. These countries’ rising prominence in the 
list of targets may point to their growing strategic importance 
in the cyber domain, whether due to economic, political, or 
technological factors

  Broadening landscape: Interestingly, Vietnam and the United 
States, while still generating significant APT detections, have 
shown different trends. Vietnam’s detections increased by 9%, 
yet its proportional contribution decreased by \-9%, indicating a 
broadening of the targeting landscape. The United States saw 
a moderate increase of 15% in detections but experienced a \-7% 
drop in its proportional contribution, suggesting a diversification 
in the targeting strategies of APT groups.

  Geopolitical developments: Germany, China, Papua New Guinea, 
and Brazil have all seen increases in detections, with Germany 
and China witnessing significant proportional contribution 
changes. This diversification in targeting reflects the strategic 
and opportunistic adjustments APT groups make in response to 
global cybersecurity postures and geopolitical developments.

  Enhancement of national security: Conversely, Indonesia 

experienced a notable decrease in detections by \-48%, coupled 
with a \-4% drop in its proportional contribution. This reduction 
might suggest a temporary deprioritization or a successful 
enhancement of national cybersecurity measures.

  Consolidation of focus: The “Other” category, representing a 

collective of various other countries where Trellix detected APT 
related activity, saw a \-23% decrease in detections and a \-21% 
decline in proportional contribution. This decrease highlights a 
possible consolidation of focus by APT groups on specific high\-
interest targets during this period.

We see potential for the landscape to continue changing rapidly due 
to geopolitical trends.

The analysis of malicious tools used in APT campaigns from Q4 2023 
to Q1 2024 reveals notable trends in the preferences and operational 
tactics of cyber threat actors. The variance in detection rates and their 
proportional contributions provides insights into the evolving cyber 
threat landscape and the shifting dynamics of tool usage among 
these sophisticated groups.

The following trends were observed: 

  Offensive tools getting stronger: Cobalt Strike remains a tool 
of choice for many Threat groups, despite a 17% decrease in 
detections. Its relatively small decrease in proportional contribution 
variance (\+1%) suggests it retains its popularity and effectiveness in 
cyber operations, underlining the challenge of defending against 
versatile and widely used offensive tools.

  Reliance on web shells, PowerShell and Remote Access attacks: 
China Chopper, PowerSploit, and Gh0st RAT also saw significant 
decreases in detections, by 23%, 24%, and 24%, respectively. Despite 
these decreases, their slight changes in proportional contribution 
variance indicate they remain integral to the toolkit of a threat 
actor. These tools, known for their capabilities in web shell attacks, 
PowerShell exploits, and remote access, highlight the continued 
reliance on proven, versatile tools for cyber operations.

  Less detectable tools: Empire, Derusbi, BADFLICK, JJdoor/

Transporter, JumpKick, and MURKYTOP experienced similar 
downward trends in detections, all exceeding a 25% decrease. 
This uniform decline could reflect a broader shift in the tools 
preferred by threat groups or an adaptation to countermeasures 
and detection techniques, prompting a move towards newer, less 
detectable tools.

  Constant innovation: The category of “other” malicious tools saw a 
significant increase in detections, up by 30%, and a notable increase 
in its proportional contribution variance by 6\.00%. This increase 
underscores the constant innovation and adaptation among threat 
actors, as they explore new tools and techniques to evade detection 
and achieve their objectives.

The evolving preferences in malicious tool usage signify 
the adaptive nature of cyber threat actors in response to 
cybersecurity developments. 

As defense mechanisms become more 
sophisticated, so too do the offensive tools 
and tactics of APT groups.

The shift towards a broader range of tools, as indicated by the increase 
in “Other” detections, highlights the necessity for continuous research, 
threat intelligence, and adaptive defense strategies to mitigate the risk 
posed by these evolving cyber threats.

  Tactical shifts: Conversely, Rundll32 and WMIC have seen 
increases in their use but faced decreases in proportional 
contribution variances, indicating a shift in the tactical 
preferences of APT groups despite these tools’ continued utility.

  Tool diversification: Cmd, the good old command\-line 

interpreter on Windows systems also experienced a substantial 
increase in usage, with detections up by 65%. Despite its 
increased use, its proportional contribution variance has 
decreased by \-2\.5%, suggesting a broader diversification in tool 
usage among APT groups. 

The “Other” category, representing a variety of less commonly 
used or more specialized tools, saw a 42% increase in detections. 
However, it experienced a significant decrease in proportional 
contribution variance (\-21%), highlighting the expanding arsenal of 
tools at the disposal of cyber threat actors.

The evolving landscape of non\-malicious tool usage by APT groups 
illustrates the complexity of detecting and defending against 
sophisticated cyber threats. The strategic selection and application 
of these tools reveal a deep understanding of the targeted 
environments and the efforts to remain undetected. 

 CISO TIP: Cybersecurity defenses must, therefore, advance 
 beyond traditional malware detection to include behavioral 
 analysis and anomaly detection to counteract the misuse of 

legitimate tools in cyber operations.

Data collected through the Trellix ATLAS global sensors, coupled with 
strategic Insights from industry vetted reporting, delivered by the 
Trellix Advanced Research Center allows our customers to identify 
threat actors targeting their respective sectors and use our behavioral 
analysis to detect anomalous behavior within their environment.

Conclusion 

The analysis of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) activities from 
Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 has illuminated the dynamic and increasingly 
complex nature of the cyber threat landscape. Our examination of the 
statistics related to APT group origins, targeted countries, malicious 
and non\-malicious tool usage reveals several key trends that 
underscore the evolving strategies of cyber threat actors.

APT groups continue to demonstrate high degrees of

1\. Adaptability and sophistication

2\. Leveraging a mix of malicious tools

3\. Exploiting legitimate system utilities to conduct espionage, 

disrupt operations, and steal sensitive information.

The significant variances observed in the targeting and operational 
tactics of these groups reflect not only their strategic objectives 
but also their response to global cybersecurity developments and 
defensive measures.

The dramatic shifts in targeting practices, with certain countries 
experiencing substantial increases in APT\-related activities, highlight 
the geopolitical motivations driving these cyber operations. Similarly, 
the changes in tool usage, including the notable rise in “living off 
the land” tactics, emphasize the ongoing challenge of detecting and 
countering APT threats within a landscape where legitimate and 
malicious activities are increasingly intertwined.

Moreover, the diversification in APT origins and the broadening of 
their targeting strategies indicate a global proliferation of cyber 
capabilities and the need for a unified and collaborative approach 
to cybersecurity. 

It is clear that no nation or organization is 
immune to the reach of these sophisticated 
threat actors.

Overview

As a relatively new China state\-sponsored APT group, Volt Typhoon 
stands out because of its unique behavior pattern and targeting 
profiles, which deviate from the conventional cyber espionage 
and intelligence collection of other China\-associated APT groups. 
Previous open\-source reporting suggests that this Chinese APT group 
has pre\-positioned itself on industrial controls IT networks to facilitate 
lateral movement to disrupt operational technology (OT) assets and 
functions in the event of geopolitical crisis or war. Trellix telemetry 
data shows that since resuming its operations in January 2024, 
Volt Typhoon has repeatedly targeted the global government 
sector, including the United States, while employing living\-off\-the\-
land techniques. 

Operational timeline

Trellix global telemetry data shows that Volt Typhoon was first 
detected in mid\-2021, but became largely dormant with little or no 
activity from August 2023 through January 2024\. This break period 
may result from a culmination of threat investigations in the months 
following the first vendor report on Volt Typhoon published in May 
2023 that attracted global attention. It could also be due to Volt 
Typhoon possibly shifting its attack infrastructure during this period 
due to public exposure, so few threat activities were detected. 

Volt Typhoon detection timeline from July 2023 to March 2024 (Source: Trellix ATLAS)

Volt Typhoon resumed operations around mid\-January 2024 based 
on Trellix telemetry data. Since mid\-January 2024, Trellix telemetry 
detected over 7,100 malicious activities associated with Volt Typhoon, 
with periodic spikes throughout the period from January through 
March 2024\.

Tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) 

Our detection data suggest that since returning to operations in 
mid\-January 2024, Volt Typhoon has consistently leveraged a number 
of native Windows tools and functionality to execute commands for 
malicious reasons. These tools, known as living\-off\-the\-land (LOTL) 
tools—which are dual\-use tools that are legitimate software and 
functions available in the system—have become increasingly popular 
among China\-based nation\-state actor groups, including 
Volt Typhoon. Netsh.exe is one of these tools that can be used for 
various malicious purposes, such as disabling firewall settings or 
setting up a proxy tunnel to allow remote host access to an infected 
host. Ldifde is another tool leveraged by Volt Typhoon threat actors 
for information collection. 

After gaining access to a domain controller, attackers may use Ldifde.
exe to export sensitive data or perform authorized changes to the 
directory. Similarly, Volt Typhoon threat actors also use ntdsutil 
for malicious attempts. Ntdsutil is a legitimate tool that allows 
administrators to perform database maintenance; however, it can also 
be used to create a dump of the Active Directory to harvest credentials 
and exfiltrate sensitive data. 

The Volt Typhoon threat actor continued to use open\-source tools, 
such as FRP, Impacket, and Mimikatz, in their threat operations. Trellix 
telemetry also detected Volt Typhoon using the following LOTL tools 
and commands between February and March 2023: 

  Comsvcs

  Dnscmd

  Ldifde

  MiniDump 

  Net

Ransomware Landscape Evolution

In Q4 2023, the cyber threat landscape witnessed an escalation in 
ransomware attacks, with new families from the year making an 
increasingly significant impact. 

  EDR killer tools: Among these, the emergence of the D0nut 

ransomware gang was particularly noteworthy for their innovative 
use of an EDR killer tool, showcasing an advanced tactic to 
circumvent endpoint detection and enhance the effectiveness of 
their attacks. More on this in the following section.

  Vulnerability exploitation: This period also saw a continuation 

of the trend towards exploiting critical vulnerabilities to facilitate 
ransomware deployment. Notably, CVE\-2023\-4966, referred to as 
Citrix Bleed, was exploited by LockBit 3\.0 affiliates, highlighting 
the ongoing vulnerability of critical infrastructure to sophisticated 
cyber attacks. Additionally, the exploitation of CVE\-2023\-22518 in 
Confluence Data Center and Server underscored the attackers’ 
focus on infiltrating widely\-used business platforms to deploy 
ransomware. The Cactus ransomware campaign, which targeted

Qlik Sense installations by exploiting newly 
discovered vulnerabilities, further demonstrated the attackers’ 
agility in adapting to security landscapes and exploiting 
emerging vulnerabilities. Making Q4 2023 an active quarter 
for ransomware groups. 

However the status quo was about to be shaken up in Q1 2024 by 
a noteworthy Law Enforcement action.

Operation Cronos: Law enforcement action 
to disrupt LockBit

Starting February 19, 2024 an international law enforcement action, 
Operation Cronos, unfolded. It gracefully disrupted the infamous 
LockBit Gang, giving the long standing crime group a taste of their 
own medicine. Law Enforcement didn’t only display the well known 
takedown notices but eventually had complete control of the crime 
group’s leaksite and displayed some leaks of their own by exposing 
the crime group to the world. Several indictments we presented and 
active affiliates received a friendly welcome message when they 
logged in to the LockBit backend, making it crystal clear that their 
identities were known. 

These actions were aimed at not only disrupting LockBit’s operation, 
but also damaging their reputation and breaking the trust within 
the gang. 

At the time of finalizing this report, Operation Cronos got another 
plot twist. Global law enforcement went for round two by disclosing 
the true identity of LockBit’s ring leader. This wasn’t the only victory 
for law enforcement; on May 1st the REvil affiliate that attacked 
Kayesa and many other organizations was sentenced to 13 years in 
prison and has to repay $16 million USD in damages. More info on 
how Trellix Advanced Research Center assisted in the REvil case 
can be read here.

Last year, our February report identified LockBit as the most 
aggressive with ransom demands. These cybercriminals use a variety 
of techniques to execute their campaigns, including exploiting 
vulnerabilities found as far back as 2018\. Through 2023, LockBit 
consistently remained the most prevalent ransomware group with the 
largest number of victims posted on their name\-and\-shame site. They 
primarily targeted North American and European organizations across 
various sectors, impacting the Industrial Goods \& Services sector the 
most. In 2023 LockBit kept continuously evolving and introducing 
new tools and methods to their ransomware program. Notable events 
include LockBit working on development of LockBit Green encryptor 
based on the leaked code of Conti ransomware as well as LockBit 
variants targeting MacOS. Furthermore, we witnessed LockBit RaaS 
offering in 2023 a new home for affiliates of other RaaS programs such 
as ALPHV and NoEscape whose operations got shut down.

In the aftermath of the disruptive actions, we witnessed LockBit 
frantically trying to save face and restore the lucrative operation. 
This was to be expected given the publicity of LockBit’s criminal 
activities, however in the cybercriminal underground, a server is 
easier restored than years of trust. It remains to be seen how much 
information law enforcement has obtained on LockBit’s operation, 
persona and its affiliates.

This uncertainty creates a huge risk for 
any cyber criminal willing to engage with 
LockBit and their (former) team.

It became very clear after the law enforcement actions that it is a 
dog\-eat\-dog world amongst criminals. The Trellix Advanced Research 
Center observed other actors using the leaked LockBit Black version 
to impersonate the well\-known brand for their own financial gain. 

Imposters or not, the victims they made were real, all these events 
made the last two quarters definitely fit for a movie script.

A global look at ransomware

During our research into ransomware activity in the first quarter of 
2024, we investigated multiple sources: leak sites, telemetry, and 
public reporting. A few words about each of the categories.

  Leak sites: These sites are designed to show proof of extorted 

victims who have not paid the demanded ransom, allowing for a 
look into the criminal gang’s activity. Additionally, it is important 
to note that the leak sites do not necessarily accurately reflect 
the landscape. Given that they are operated by criminals, not all 
statements are truthful nor correct. Further, if the gangs keep their 
word, the victims who pay the ransom are not listed, thus giving 
an incomplete picture. The data used in this report refers to overall 
trends from leak sites and does paint a meaningful picture.

and detections denote when a file, URL, IP address, or other 
indicator is detected by one of our products and reported back 
to us. This is not to say that every detection is an infection, as 
customers test the detection of certain files to fine tune their 
internal rules, which also show up in the aggregated logging. As 
such, this data remains useful when looking at the bigger picture, 
as trends still show.

  Public reports: Reports from vendors and individuals have been 
processed by our Advanced Research Center to analyze features 
and distill trends. There is an inherent bias for each report, an 
example of which can be the dominant geographical presence 
of a vendor compared to another vendor. This difference might 
cause one reporting entity to report on something while another 
entity might report on something else. Given the variety of biases 
for the included reports, we do not apply a specific filter.

Active ransomware groups

When looking at the aggregated leak site posts from Q1 2024, 
many show signs of activity. On occasion, we see leak sites post 
general announcements, but the majority are “proof” of extortion or 
leaks of victim data. They’ll also often post one victim multiple times 
which can cause inflation due to a victim being counted more than 
once in data.

When looking at the frequency of the five most active ransom gang 
leak sites, the graphs are dwarfed by LockBit’s activity. The activity 
of the gangs aside from LockBit average over 50 posts in a quarter, 
meaning the average time between the posting of two victims is less 
than two days. As stated above, these numbers reflect non\-paying 
victims, meaning that the actual number of victims is likely to be 
higher although there is no method to define how many.

Given that ransomware is a threat for all sectors in nearly every 
geography, the detection metrics make sense with respect to the 
population of customers.

In the quarter prior, telemetry looks rather similar, barring the 
increase of detections in India and China. We have no indication that 
there was a specific campaign against these regions and suspect 
malware testing was done and caused a higher number of detections 
in said regions.

Targeted sectors

The aggregation of global telemetry per sector shows that half of 
the detections come from the transportation and shipping industry, 
and just over a quarter comes from the financial services. These 
two sectors make up more than 72% of all detections, which is 
logical: the availability of their services is of the utmost importance. 
If a transportation company cannot move goods around due to 
a ransomware attack, their operational process cannot continue, 
causing a huge financial burden. Likewise, the financial industry is 
built on trust, while the leakage of sensitive data and/or downtime of 
the company due to a ransomware attack, hurts financial companies 
in their core.

TOP 6 TARGETED SECTORS 
IN Q1 OF 2024 

Transportation and Shipping (45\.41%)

Finance (26\.78%)

Telecom (9\.88%)

Media \& Communications (6\.8%)

Healthcare (4\.33%)

Technology (3\.87%)

In the last quarter of 2023, the top targeted sectors were slightly 
different, albeit without differences in the top two sectors. Those two 
were responsible for an even larger share, totalling at a combined 78% 
of all detections for the given period. The technology and healthcare 
sectors decreased in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the prior 
quarter, but the difference itself cannot be attributed to one or more 
specific events.

Tools and techniques

The last of the three mentioned sources are public reports. Based 
on the collected reports, MITRE techniques, associated tools and 
commandlines can be distilled. 

CISO TIP: These can be used by organization blue teams from a 
detection perspective: by focusing on the most used techniques 
and tools, multiple types of attacks from different actors can 
be mitigated, starting by the most effective. Additionally, red and 
purple teaming exercises can focus on these techniques to test 

 what detection measures are in\-place. 

This table below shows the most frequent techniques, listed in 
descending order.

Much like in the above section on APTs, attackers continue to 
leverage legitimate tools for crime. The used tools influence the 
observed techniques, as a tool is a means to an end, which is a 
technique in this case. For example, PowerShell and the Windows 
Command Shell are often used to execute additional commands on 
the system, such as the removal of the shadow copies, which is the 
main contributor to the “Inhibit System Recovery “ Technique. This is 
also the reason as to why they are the top used tools, as shown in 
the image below.

The usage of VSSAdmin, BCDEdit, and wevutil are signs that the 
ransomware is ensuring the victim’s system cannot recover to a 
normal state, as it would be in prior to the attack. The usage of reg 
shows the changes to the registry, which can be done for a variety 
of reasons. Malware often uses the registry for persistence, but 
ransomware isn’t keen on persistence, as it has no purpose once the 
encryption finishes. Instead, it can alter other settings, to allow certain 
actions which normally wouldn’t be possible. Rundll32 is often used 
to either load and run a dynamic link library, but often it is also the 
target of process injection.

Much like the quarter prior to the one above, PowerShell and the 
command prompt top the list for the exact same reason. VSSAdmin 
and BCDEdit are present as well, though the Windows Event Util 
(wevtutil) is not present in the top tools list. Given the few occurrences 
of all mentioned tools, with the highest frequency being 13 in either 
of the quarters, it is no surprise that not all campaigns use the same 
tools. A small deviation can lead to the exclusion of such tools.

The Emergence of EDR Killer and Evasion Tools

The global adoption of EDR solutions by many organizations 
has proven to better detect, understand, and respond to more 
sophisticated attacks. Threat actors nowadays often rely on living\-off\-
the\-land binaries (LOLBins) and more complex attack methods, but 
with the presence of EDR technology it has become more difficult for 
attackers to remain undetected. 

Security however, remains a cat and mouse game, and attackers 
are trying to find ways to evade or disable EDR solutions. This 
movement has given birth to a whole wave of EDR killer and evasion 
tools/ techniques, some of which are being offered on cybercriminal 
underground forums. We saw earlier, for example, that the D0nut 
ransomware gang has gained prominence thanks to their own 
EDR killer.

January campaign using Spyboy’s EDR Terminator tool

One common technique is by exploiting vulnerable drivers to 
achieve privileged code execution is referred to as a Bring Your Own 
Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attack. 

An example of this method is the EDR “Terminator” tool that was 
offered by a threat actor called Spyboy. The Terminator tool leverages 
a legitimate but vulnerable Windows driver belonging to the Zemana 
anti\-malware tool to execute arbitrary code from within the Windows 
Kernel likely exploiting CVE\-2021\-31728\. Terminator appeared online in 
mid\-2023 and Trellix issued a detailed knowledge base article around 
product coverage which can be found here. 

From January 11 \- 17, 2024, the Trellix Advanced Research Center 
noticed an unusual set of detections of Spyboy’s Terminator in Trellix 
telemetry – a new campaign. This Terminator campaign spiked for 
three days during the six day period and was detected multiple times 
at a single government organization, a national utilities company and 
a satellite communications company. Given the specific targets Trellix 
assesses with a high level of confidence that the attack was related to 
the Russian\-Ukrainian conflict.

Earlier in 2023, a tool with a similar purpose was described by Sophos 
– AuKill. It also used a vulnerable driver it brought (BYOVD). The 
drivers used in the EDR Terminator and AuKill cases are different, but 
both are benign drivers. In contrast, some campaigns in 2022 saw 
similar tooling use custom malicious drivers which were loaded.

Abusing benign drivers for such a purpose makes it harder to detect 
such attacks, and coincides with the aforementioned LOLBin usage. 
Although a binary and a driver differ technically, the intent and motive 
are similar, if not identical. The HermeticWiper from 2022 also comes 
to mind with regards to using a benign driver. In that case, the driver 
was used to wipe a machine, rather than disabling the antivirus. A 
further overlap with the usage of the EDR Terminator mentioned 
above, and the attribution of the HermeticWiper, is the usage by a 
pro\-Russian actor.

We’ve also seen an example of the Discord CDN being used for 
malware distribution at one of our LATAM customers. Our team has 
observed Discord continue to be used in malware attacks in this way. 

CISO TIP: It is absolutely essential every SOC is monitoring their 
EDR closely. Alert and logging needs to be set up so if EDR tools 
are turned off, the SOC is notified immediately and appropriate 
action can be taken. Shutting down of EDR tools can be an 
indicator of tampering, and moving quickly is critical to limiting 
an attacker’s access to your network. It is also critically important 
to use a defense\-in\-depth strategy, allowing other tools like your 

 Network Detection and Response (NDR) platform to detect 

potential incidents. and moving quickly is critical to limit the 
access an attacker gets to your network.

Email Remains Ripe for Attackers 

Trellix processes two billion email samples and 93 million email 
attachments per day. With this, comes an immense amount of data 
and opportunity to observe new techniques leveraged by attackers 
targeting victims via email. 

Election donation scams 

Election donation phishing scams exploit individuals’ goodwill and 
support for political candidates by leveraging patriotic sentiments and 
using famous political candidates names. In Q1 2024, our researchers 
found cybercriminals abusing legitimate marketing services to create 
convincing donation pages adorned with images of candidates 
alongside American flags, urging recipients to donate. 

These scams utilize authentic marketing service URLs to deceive 
recipients, leading them to believe the emails are legitimate. However, 
the emails are sent to capitalize on people’s generosity. Links within 
the emails direct users to donation pages, where they’re prompted to 
enter financial details or send contributions to the senders’ accounts 
or wallet addresses.

Our email researchers observed the following malicious emails 
leveraging election donations.

Taxation phishing 

In the context of taxation, phishing attacks are particularly concerning. 
Scammers pose as government agencies, tax authorities, or reputable 
tax preparation services to trick individuals into divulging personal 
information. They may claim that you owe back taxes, have unfiled 
returns, or are eligible for a tax refund. Their ultimate goal is to 
obtain your Social Security number, bank account details, or other 
valuable data. The email contains links that appear to lead to official 
government or tax service websites but instead redirect you to 
fraudulent sites designed to steal data.

Trellix also observed a surge in such emails pretending to be from the 
Australian Tax Authority in the first quarter of 2024 and successfully 
detected them.

The GenAI Arms Race: 
Findings from the Cybercriminal Underground 

AI and machine learning are no longer only accessible to 
organizations with the deepest pockets. ChatGPT and the like can 
be used by anyone, including criminals, and so, AI has become an 
arms race between the good actors and the bad actors. AI is powerful 
and should be responsibly leveraged to further business goals, 
but it is imperative organizations do not let the attackers gain the 
advantage. We need to use newfound capabilities to outsmart 
cyber criminals as their tactics become honed, and their weapons 
become more dangerous.

CISO TIP: The role of the CISO has become even more essential 
as they’re looked upon to navigate this evolving landscape. 
 With cyberattacks on the rise, AI pressures mounting, and 
responsibilities growing, it’s no surprise 90% of CISOs find 
themselves under increased pressure. Keeping pace with AI and 

 GenAI is vital, and almost all CISOs agree their organizations 

could do more. Read more in Trellix’s latest report, Mind of the 
CISO: Decoding the GenAI Impact.

Threat actors are attracted to GenAI because of its accelerated 
capabilities and affordability. Most significantly, it provides expertise: 
bad actors can craft spear phishing emails in any language with 
perfect grammar, logos, and login info. They can find, write, and test 
exploits 10x faster without elite skills. 

Our Advanced Research Center team regularly scours the 
cybercriminal underground to follow trends. GenAI is gaining steam 
with cybercriminals and they are sharing their successes and selling 
their tools. Since our last report, we’ve observed the following since 
the start of 2024\.

‘ChatGPT in Jabber’ project possibly used by 
a Russian criminal APT group 

In January, we observed an XSS underground forum’s premium actor 
xatab searching for a developer to create “ChatGPT 4\.0 in Jabber” 
along with an API and instructions on how to use it. 

Besides the Cyber criminal embrace of LLM integrations It is also 
possible that xatab’s intention/motivation behind the “ChatGPT in 
Jabber” project is to intercept \& collect threat actors correspondence, 
eavesdrop on their requests to gain intelligence \& knowledge on what 
cybercriminals are interested in and what are the main topics \& scopes 
of their illicit activities aided by GenAI. 

We observed the following \-

xatab shared on the XSS forum instructions and the API key for 

“ChatGPT in Jabber”

On January 31, 2024, xatab offered $2,000 for their ‘ChatGPT in Jabber’ 
project on the XSS forum. Based on the recent XSS complaint raised 
by an actor germans who built the requested bot and got ignored by 
xatab at first, it seems that germans agreed to develop the ChatGPT 
bot in Jabber for $1500\. The bot was created for both Exploit forum 
(@exploit\[.]im) and XSS (@thesecure\[.]biz) Jabber servers and xatab 
posted it on both Exploit and XSS darknet forums supposedly to test it 
and get feedback from the forum members. The bot may be based on 
the xmppgpt project. 

The xatab actor has multiple posts on Exploit/XSS forums where they 
advise they are an APT team (known in certain circles experienced 
pentesters) interested in hiring a broker of corp accesses of US/UK/
Canada/Australia organizations for fruitful cooperation. They offered 
20% of the revenue share for every access and they deposited one BTC 
to both Exploit and XSS forums to show their intention/seriousness of 
their offer. 

By providing free ChatGPT 4\.0 to cybercriminal community xatab is 
achieving two things:

Trellix has tested the “ChatGPT in Jabber” project as per the given 
instructions and it seems to work as advised by the threat actor. 

GenAI adoption in InfoStealers 

On February 21, 2024 our researchers observed a threat actor 
MetaStealer advertising a new, revamped version of MetaStealer on 
XSS forum. MetaStealer is an infostealer which first appeared in 2021 
and is believed to be a spinoff of well\-known infostealer Redline. There 
have been multiple versions of MetaStealer seen in the wild, however 
the recent version spotted by Trellix has a GenAI\-based feature to 
further avoid detection.

MetaStealer shared on the XSS forum revamped version of METASTEALER

In the below screenshot, the orange text under 35\) translates as 
“Generation of unique signatures for every build, AI is used here, the 
build remains clear (or undetected) for a longer time,” suggesting the 
developers of MetaStealer embedded a new GenAI based feature into 
their stealer which allows them to create unique builds of MetaStealer 
to evade detection and stay under the radar of AV/EDR systems for a 
longer period of time than before.

Revamped METASTEALER has an embedded GenAI based 

feature for defense evasion

Another example is a well\-established infostealer called 
LummaStealer. Since August 2023, we’ve observed the LummaStealer 
team testing an AI\-based feature which enables their infostealer users 
to detect bots among the list of logs. The AI\-based system embedded 
into LummaStealer is potentially a custom neural network which is 
trained to detect if a suspicious user log is a bot or not. LummaStealer

uses a label AI!Bot. to categorize the detected log as a bot, 
where  seems to be in a range of 0\-100, representing the bot 
detection certainly:

LummaStealer post on the RAMP forum where the actor advised their infostealer 

has an AI based feature to detect bots among the list of stealer logs

LummaStealer advised its users the neural network was still being 
trained and it will take some time for it to improve the detection 
accuracy. Moreover, in January 2024, LummaStealer advised the 
GenAI based feature by default is disabled as it slows down the work 
of the LummaStealer panel.

LummaStealer post on the RAMP forum where the actor advised the AI based bot 

detection is disabled by default

‘Telegram Pro Poster’ bot project 

In early March 2024 Trellix observed a threat actor pepe posting 
their “Telegram Pro Poster’ project on the XSS forum as a part of an 
underground competition of malicious tools/software. Telegram Pro 
Poster is a bot for “deep automation of Telegram posts.” This Python\-
based bot allows users to manage multiple (unlimited amount 
of) Telegram channels in an autonomous way by automatically 
copying the posts from “donor” Telegram channels into the target 
channels. Amongst numerous post filtering features, this bot has two 
GenAI embedded features for translating telegram messages and 
paraphrasing a given post using ChatGPT.

The XSS community of cybercriminals are already sharing their 
positive feedback on the “Telegram Pro Poster project” saying it is 
an interesting project and in competent hands this tool will certainly 
be useful. Another threat actor advised in the XSS forum thread that 
they are seeing this bot already being adopted in practice by various 
Telegram channels.

AFTERWORD 

The race is on

Operational threat intelligence provides insights into the nature, 
intent, and timing of specific cyber threats. It’s more detailed and 
contextual than tactical intelligence, including information about 
threat actors’ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). 

Organizations can use operational intelligence to understand the 
broader context of cyber attacks, such as the motivations behind 
them or the methods used, helping security teams anticipate and 
prepare for specific types of attacks.

 Volt Typhoon: Nation\-state APT 
threats with a focus on China

In my work with customers, I know that the most important objective 
of every CISO is to limit risk to their organization. Applying operational 
threat intelligence is a tangible way to limit that risk as it allows 
CISOs and their SecOps teams to look ahead and get their footing. 
It empowers them to identify gaps in their security measures across 
their entire surface of the organization and get in the minds of their 
opponents, looking to knock them off track.

We share our threat intelligence to give you a solid, fact\-based 
platform supporting some of the most important decisions you’ll 
make. Our purpose is to help you substantially improve your cyber 
defense and beat attackers to the next leg of the race \- however you 
choose to.

METHODOLOGY

Collection: Trellix and the world\-class experts from our Advanced 
Research Center gather the statistics, trends, and insights that 
comprise this report from a wide range of global sources. 

  Captive sources: In some cases, telemetry is generated by 

Trellix security solutions on customer cybersecurity networks 
and defense frameworks deployed around the world in both 
public and private sector networks, including those delivering 
technology, infrastructure, or data services. These systems, which 
number in the millions, generate data from a billion sensors. 

  Open sources: In other cases, Trellix leverages a combination of 

patented, proprietary, and open\-source tools to scrape sites, logs, 
and data repositories on the internet, as well as the dark web, 
such as “leak sites” where malicious actors publish information 
about or belonging to their ransomware victims. 

Normalization: The aggregated data is fed into our Insights and ATLAS 
platforms. Leveraging machine learning, automation, and human 
acuity, the team cycles through an intensive, integrated, and iterative 
set of processes – normalizing the data, enriching results, removing 
personal information, and identifying correlations across attack 
methods, agents, sectors, regions, strategies, and outcomes. 

Analysis: Next, Trellix analyzes this vast reservoir of information, with 
reference to (1\) its extensive threat intelligence knowledge base, (2\) 
cybersecurity industry reports from highly respected and accredited 
sources, and (3\) the experience and insights of Trellix cybersecurity 
analysts, investigators, reverse engineering specialists, forensic 
researchers, and vulnerability experts. 

Interpretation: Finally, the Trellix team extracts, reviews, and validates 
meaningful insights that can help cybersecurity leaders and their 
SecOps teams (1\) understand the most recent trends in the cyberthreat 
environment, and (2\) use this perspective to improve their ability to 
anticipate, prevent, and defend their organization from cyberattacks in 
the future.

Application: How to Use This Information 

It’s imperative that any industry\-leading assessment team and 
process understand, acknowledge and, where possible, mitigate 
the effects of bias – the natural, embedded, or invisible inclination 
to either accept, reject, or manipulate facts and their meaning. The 
same precept holds true for consumers of the content. 

Unlike a highly structured, control\-base mathematical test or 
experiment, this report is inherently a sample of convenience – 
a non\-probability type of study often used in medical, healthcare, 
psychology, and sociology testing that makes use of data that is 
available and accessible.

  In short, our findings here are based on what we can observe and, 
pointedly, do not include evidence of threats, attacks, or tactics 
that evaded detection, reporting, and data capture. 

  In the absence of “complete” information or “perfect” visibility, 
this is the type of study best suited to this report’s objective: to 
identify known sources of critical data on cybersecurity threats 
and develop rational, expert, and ethical interpretations of this 
data that inform and enable best practices in cyber defense. 

How to Understand the Analysis in this Report 

Understanding the insights and data in this report requires briefly 
reviewing the following guidelines:

  A snapshot in time: Nobody has access to all the logs of all the 
systems connected to the internet, not all security incidents 
are reported, and not all victims are extorted and included in 
the leak sites. However, tracking what we can leads to a better 
understanding of the various threats, while reducing analytical and 
investigative blind spots.

  False positives and false negatives: Among the high\-performance 
technical characteristics of Trellix’s special tracking and telemetry 
systems to collect data are mechanisms, filters, and tactics that 
help counter or remove false positive and negative results. These 
help to elevate the level of analysis and the quality of our findings.

  Detections, not infections: When we talk about telemetry, we talk 
about detections, not infections. A detection is recorded when a 
file, URL, IP address, or other indicator is detected by one of our 
products and reported back to us.

  Uneven data capture: Some data sets require careful 

interpretation. Telecommunications data, for example, includes 
telemetry from ISP clients operating in many other industries 
and sectors.

  Nation\-state attribution: Similarly, determining nation\-state 

responsibility for various cyberattacks and threats can be very 
difficult given the common practice among nation\-state hackers 
and cybercriminals to spoof one another, or disguise malicious 
activity as coming from a trusted source.
