5. GenAI and the Cybercriminal Underground

An EDR evasion tool was just successfully used to shut
down endpoint detection and response capabilities at
another organization in your industry.

The cybersecurity race to outpace attackers and stop
them from using legitimate security tools for bad is
getting more complicated.

As CISO, you have to move with agility, speed,
confidence and control. Your CEO and Board are
waiting to know more about your logging and alert
tools. You task your team to identify gaps, and you
have a plan to address them.

The cybersecurity race is a triathlon. You’re competing
in SecOps, Technology and Intelligence. The race is on,
and it’s a game of endurance.
As defense mechanisms become more
sophisticated, so too do the offensive
tools and tactics nation-state and cyber
criminal actors.

# FOREWORD
Operational threat intelligence and the ability to add context for your
environment to global threats has never been more important to the
role of the CISO.

As we’re tasked to do more with less, CISOs and their SecOps teams
require threat intelligence to anticipate threats, identify and prepare for
the most relevant threats targeting your organization, align programs
and budget against the most likely threats and actors, and finally, to
move from a reactive to proactive posture.

As “Customer Zero” for Trellix, I have never seen more potential for
intelligence to shape the way responders move and strategize.

Take this content, digest it, and put it to use in your strategic planning,
budget rationalization, board education and operational support.

I hope this insight is educational, informative and beneficial, and acts as
a stepping stone to better guide and influence how you plan, prepare,
and persist against APTs.

# PREFACE
With this report, and all of our reports, we aim to provide structure
around intelligence and context to what we’re observing.

The landscape
The last six months have been unprecedented - a state of polycrisis
remains and it has accelerated cybercriminal and threat actor activity
globally. We’re seeing radical shifts in behavior, including:
	
* The ransomware ecosystem is a-typical following law
enforcement action,
	
* Autonomous groups are selling their wares in penetration testing
and alternative attack methods to ransomware gangs,
	
* Warfare in Israel has triggered direct state-sponsored attacks and
hacktivism, and
	
* Threat actors are looking to be more sophisticated, and they have
access to cheap and free GenAI-based tools that empower them to
become experts overnight, and
	
* EDR Evasion and termination tools become more important to
threat actors.

A cat and mouse game
With larger implementation of endpoint detection and response (EDR)
solutions, we’re seeing the cat and mouse game of cybersecurity get
more complex. The increase of threat actors using criminal tools to
dismantle EDR has piqued our interest and is a sharp course change
from the use of traditional malware-based tools.

As defenders, we have to change course, too. EDR has proven effective
at detecting malware, ransomware and the activity of APT groups,
but if EDR is taken offline, what’s an organization and their CISO to
do? You need logging, you need alerting, and you need operational
threat intelligence to keep from being blind to unusual behavior in your
system. There’s a new layer of gameplay.

We work diligently to share threat intelligence with the community - a
core value of ours to keep ahead of adversaries - and track campaigns
and threat groups at scale.

The landscape is shifting more than ever. Our aim is to support our
customers and the industry at large with the intelligence needed to
sharpen defenses, make countermeasures, and identify gaps.

In this cat and mouse game, we have to play to win.

# INTRODUCTION: THE CYBERTHREAT REPORT: JUNE 2024
## Geopolitical Events Impacting the Cyber Domain
Research from the Trellix Advanced Research Center into activity
from October 1, 2023 - March 31, 2024 has revealed a shift in threat
activities, with a noticeable increase in geopolitically motivated
cyber threat operations. Notably, major regional and global events
– such as military exercises, political or economic summits, political
conventions, and elections – drove cyber threat activities.

Trellix analysts assess with moderate confidence that threat actors
focused on these events to collect relevant intelligence about
counterparts, probe networks proactively to obtain information for
situational awareness, or preposition on IT networks strategically for
future attacks.
	
* Presidents Biden and Xi meet in San Francisco: In November
2023, Trellix telemetry detection data indicated an uptick in
malicious activity from China-associated APT actor groups only
days before the meeting between U.S. President Biden and
China’s President Xi in San Francisco as part of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting. The number of threat
activities decreased significantly following the Biden-Xi summit
and throughout the APEC summit.

As the APEC summit came to an end, the level of threat activity
fell to its lowest point in the month of November 2023. This
pattern of threat activity from China-associated threat actor
groups likely suggests that China’s state-sponsored threat actor
groups were heavily influenced by geopolitical events such as
APEC. It may also indicate that China’s APT groups may have
deliberately withdrawn their hacking activity during a major
political event possibly to preserve their public image and
international reputation.
	
* Israel-Hamas war: Threats from Iranian-linked APT threat
actor groups have also been driven by political developments
surrounding the Israel-Hamas war. In the United States, Trellix
global telemetry data shows periodic surges of malicious activity
from Iranian-linked APT threat actor groups in the last six
months (with the exception of late November and December
2023). Specifically, our global telemetry shows a reduction in
threat activity from Iranian-linked APT groups targeting U.S.
organizations during the periods of Israel hostage exchange and
ceasefire agreements in late November 2023 and December
2023, when the U.S. pushed for a humanitarian ceasefire in the
Gaza Strip as Iran is an open supporter of Hamas. Additionally,
Trellix global telemetry indicates that Iranian-linked APT threat
actor groups has employed a variety of TTPs, including phishing,
information stealer, backdoors, downloader, malicious webshells,
and commonly exploited vulnerabilities to target organizations in
Israel during the reporting period.

* Military drills: In addition, multinational military exercises to
enhance combat readiness can trigger increased malicious
activities. Most recently, in March 2024, Trellix global telemetry
data shows repeated surges in threat activities in South Korea
during the U.S.-South Korean large-scale joint military exercises,
known as Freedom Shield, from March 4 to March 14, 2024.
These military drills are designed to reflect the “Korea Theater of
Operations” and counter North Korea’s evolving nuclear threat.
Specifically, threat detections in South Korea exceeded over
150,000 detections on March 7 and March 13, 2024, respectively,
which is around seven times the usual 20,000 daily detections
in the country.
	
* Russia-Ukraine war: Continued kinetic warfare in the region
has been accompanied by cyber initiatives large and small. Most
notably, Russian-linked actors have been observed leveraging
new and more advanced wiper malware to wipe thousands of
virtual servers and PCs by attacking Ukrainian telecom provider
Kyivstar. The attack to KyivStar is one of the highest-impact
disruptive cyberattacks on Ukraine since Russia invaded the
country in 2022.

## Highlights At-a-Glance
While this report serves as a repository for research from across our
business, key themes persist:
1. Rapid and Significant Changes in the APT Landscape
    a. Russia-Linked Sandworm Escalates: As geopolitical tensions
    rise, so does APT activity across the entire ecosystem. While
    APT threats grow overall, Russia-linked Sandworm Team was
    detected 40% more in the period observed in this report.
    b. China Remains Prolific: China-linked threat groups
    remain the most prolific originator of APT activities with
    Trellix observing more than 21 million detections of threat
    activities from China-aligned threat actor groups. Over 23%
    of the detections of malicious activities are directed at the
    government sector worldwide.
    c. VoltTyphoon Activity Spikes: As a relatively new China state-
    sponsored APT group, Volt Typhoon stands out because of its
    unique behavior pattern and targeting practices. Since mid-
    January 2024, Trellix telemetry detected over 7,100 malicious
    activities associated with Volt Typhoon, with periodic spikes
    throughout the period from January through March 2024.
2. LockBit Shakes Up Ransomware Ecosystem
    a. Imposters Impact Gang Reputation: Following a
    global law enforcement action, Operation Cronos, Trellix
    observed imposters pretending to be LockBit, all while
    the group frantically tried to save face and restore the
    lucrative operation.
    b. U.S. Remains Most Targeted: The United States remained
    the most targeted by ransomware groups, followed by
    Turkey, Hongkong, India and Brazil.
    c. Transportation and Shipping Most Hit: Ransomware actors
    threatened the transportation and shipping sector the most
    in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024. The sector generated 53% and 45%
    of global ransomware detections, respectively, and was
    followed by the finance industry.
    d. Law Enforcement Action Leads to Sentencing: Before
    finalizing this report, global law enforcement disclosed the
    true identity of LockBit’s ring leader. Further action against
    ransomware criminals took place on May 1st. The REvil
    affiliate that attacked Kayesa and many other organizations
    was sentenced to 13 years in prison and repayment of
    $16 million USD.
3. EDR Killers Emerge
    a. D0nut Ransomware Gang Appears: The emergence of
    the D0nut ransomware gang was particularly noteworthy
    for their innovative use of an EDR killer tool, showcasing
    an advanced tactic to circumvent endpoint detection and
    enhance the effectiveness of their attacks.
    b. Spyboy’s EDR Evasion Tool Used to Target Telecom: A EDR
    “killer” tool by developer Spyboy called “Terminator” was
    used in a new campaign in January 2024. The tool is used
    to circumvent EDR solutions, and 80% of detections were
    targeted at the telecom sector.
4. U.S. Presidential Election Themed Scams
    a. Phishing Remains Ripe: As the world looks to see the
    outcome of November’s presidential election in the U.S.,
    scams leveraging election imagery and curated to secure
    donations have been observed.

The CyberThreat Report, June 2024

5. GenAI and the Cybercriminal Underground
    a. Free AI-Powered Tools: Trellix observed a free ChatGPT
    4.0 Jabber tool available in the cybercriminal underground,
    which both allows the developer to enable threat actors
    to adopt GenAI into their operations and to create a GenAI
    knowledge base to learn from other cyber criminals or even
    steal their ideas and tools.
    b. InfoStealer Adoption Rises: Two InfoStealers with GenAI-
    based features were observed to be used by cybercriminals.
    MetaStealer and LummaStealer are equipped with GenAI to
    evade detection and to detect bots among the list of logs,
    respectively. GenAI capabilities make these criminal tactics
    harder to find and harder to stop.

# REPORT ANALYSIS, INSIGHTS, AND DATA
## Nation States and Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)
From October 2023 through March 2024, Trellix observed a 17%
increase in APT-backed detections compared to the previous six
months. This is notable as our last report identified a staggering 50%
increase in these detections. The APT ecosystem is fundamentally
different from a year ago – more aggressive, cunning and active.

In the rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape, Advanced Persistent
Threat (APT) groups continue to pose a significant and sophisticated
challenge to global cybersecurity.

We aim to thoroughly analyze activities associated with Advanced
Persistent Threats (APT) detected from Q4 2023 through Q1 2024.
This analysis focuses on the origins of these threats, their main
targets, and the tools used in their operations. We compare these
findings to data from the first half of 2023 (Q2 to Q3) using two key
metrics: percentage variance and proportional contribution variance.
	
* Percentage variance: This metric helps us see if the activity of a
specific APT group, the targeting of certain countries, or the use
of particular tools has gone up, gone down, or stayed the same
over time. Understanding this helps us track how the behaviors of
these threat actors change and how the overall landscape of cyber
threats is evolving.
	
* Proportional contribution variance: This metric adds context by
not just showing the raw change in activity, but how this change
stands against the backdrop of the entire cybersecurity threat
environment. For example, even if detections of a particular actor
have increased significantly, this might still represent a small part of
the total cyber threats if the overall threat environment has become
much busier. Conversely, if their detections have decreased, but the
rest of the threat environment has slowed down even more, this
actor could be becoming relatively more significant.

By employing these metrics, we aim to provide a nuanced
understanding of the shifts in APT activities, enabling us to draw
insights into their strategic objectives, preferred methodologies,
and the cybersecurity challenges they pose. The following sections
delve into these findings, shedding light on the intricate world of
APTs and the continuous efforts required to safeguard against their
sophisticated threats.

### Active nation states and APT groups
Further, the period spanning from October 2023 - March 2024
witnessed significant fluctuations in the activities of various APT
groups. These fluctuations not only underscore the dynamic nature
of cyber threats but also highlight shifts in the operational focus and
techniques employed by these sophisticated actors.

TOP 10 APTS BASED ON DETECTIONS BETWEEN THE LAST
QUARTER OF 2023 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2024.
CHANGES IN CYBER THREAT GROUP ACTIVITY:
VARIANCE AND PROPORTIONAL CONTRIBUTION

| Advanced Persistent Threats | Percentage Variance | Proportional Contribution Variance |
|---|---|---|
| Sandworm Team | 1669.43% | 40.34% |
| Mustang Panda | -2.19% | -6.14% |
| Lazarus | 66.87% | 0.07% |
| APT28 | 18.67% | -1.49% |
| Turla | 2.95% | -1.74% |
| Covellite | 85.30% | 0.23% |
| APT29 | 123.98% | 0.53% |
| APT10 | 80.46% | 0.17% |
| UNC4698 | 368.75% | 1.14% |
| APT34 | 96.73% | 0.23% |
| Other | -28.99% | -33.33% |

* Shift in tactics: Sandworm Team, historically known for its
disruptive cyber operations, has seen a staggering increase in
detections by 1669%, with a proportional contribution variance
of 40%. This monumental rise suggests an unprecedented
escalation in their cyber activities from the Russia-linked group.
	
* Aggressive expansion of operations: APT29, a group with
a history of extensive cyber espionage, showed a significant
uptick in activity, with detections increasing by 124%. Similarly,
APT34 and Covellite also demonstrated substantial increases in
detections, by 97% and 85% respectively, indicating heightened
operational tempos or the initiation of new campaigns.
	
* Homeostasis: In contrast, groups like Mustang Panda, Turla, and
APT28 saw minimal changes in their activity levels, with Mustang
Panda showing a slight decrease of -2% and Turla a modest
increase of 3% in detections.
	
* New actors emerge: Noteworthy is the emergence of UNC4698,
which saw a 363% increase in detections, suggesting the rise of a
potentially significant new player in the APT landscape.

**WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT UNC4698?**
Not a lot is known about this group, but researchers have been
able to recognize their behavior as group activity and don’t know
yet how to attribute it.

Having said that, what is known about UNC4698 is that its focus
is on industrial espionage, gathering sensitive operational data
which could be used to support economic or national security
objectives of the sponsoring state, presumably linked to China
due to the nature and regional focus of the attacks.

Its usual targets are oil and gas organizations in Asia.
They are also known to employ a specific malware that goes by
the name of ‘SNOWYDRIVE’.

UNC4698 employs a variety of tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) centered around the use of malware delivered
via USB flash drives. Here are some key TTPs associated with this
threat actor:
	
* Initial Access via Infected USB Devices: The primary
method of infection involves USB drives that contain
malicious software designed to create a backdoor on the
host system.

The CyberThreat Report, June 2024
11
Lesser-known or unidentified groups, saw a 62% increase in
detections, indicating a diverse and growing array of threats beyond
the well-documented APT entities. This increase of 8% in their
proportional contribution to the total detections highlights the
constant evolution and diversification of cyber threats.

### APT groups and countries of origin
**WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT UNC4698?**
	
* Execution through Malicious Files: The malware typically
includes a dropper that writes malicious executables and
DLLs to disk. These files often masquerade as legitimate
software to avoid detection and are executed to establish
further control.
	
* Persistence and Registry Modification: UNC4698
ensures persistence on the infected systems by modifying
the Windows registry. This allows the malware to start
automatically whenever the system boots up.
	
* Command and Control (C2) Communication: The malware
sets up a method for remote communication, allowing the
attackers to issue commands and control the compromised
systems from afar.
	
* Lateral Movement via Removable Media: The malware
can copy itself to other USB devices connected to the
infected machine, which helps in spreading the infection
to other systems.

| Country | Percentage |
|---|---|
| China | 68.30% |
| Russia | 18.32% |
| Iran | 8.59% |
| Pakistan | 1.35% |
| North Korea | 1.31% |
| Belarus | 0.6% |
| Palestine | 0.59% |
| Vietnam | 0.25% |
| South Korea | 0.21% |
| India | 0.21% |
| Other | 0.28% |

The CyberThreat Report, June 2024
12
When looking at countries of origin,
Trellix telemetry from October 2023
through March 2024 also observed
notable shifts in the landscape
of state-sponsored cyber activities.
	
* Substantial escalation in
operations: Geopolitical
motivations and cybersecurity capabilities are evolving across
different nations. Our telemetry observed the following:
    a. Russia-linked threat groups have shown a significant
    increase in APT detections, up by 31%, with its proportional
    contribution rising by 4%. This indicates a substantial
    escalation in cyber operations, possibly reflecting
    broader strategic objectives or responses to global
    cybersecurity dynamics.
    b. Iran-linked threat groups have also markedly ramped up
    cyber activities, with an 8% increase in detections and a
    3.89% rise in proportional contribution. This highlights a
    significant expansion in Iran’s cyber operations, in line with its
    geopolitical aims and involvement in the Israeli-Hamas war.
	
* Broader diversification: China remains the most prolific
originator of APT activities, with detections slightly increasing
by 1%. However, its proportional contribution to the overall
detections has seen a slight decrease of -1%, which might
suggest a broader diversification of APT origins during this
period. February of this year also saw reports of significant efforts
from China-backed APT Volt Typhoon targeting U.S. critical
infrastructure; more on this in the following section.
	
* Shift in strategy: Conversely, groups linked to North Korea,
Vietnam, and India have seen dramatic decreases in their
APT activities, with North Korea-linked detections dropping
by -82%, Vietnam by -80%, and India by -82%. The significant
downturn in North Korea’s proportional contribution (-6%) is
particularly notable, possibly indicating a shift in focus, strategy,
or capabilities.
	
* More countries emerging: Pakistan-linked and Belarus-linked
groups have seen considerable increases in their APT activities,
with detections up by 55% and an astonishing 2019%, respectively.
These increases, particularly the exponential rise associated
with Belarus, underscore the emergence of new or previously
underrecognized actors in the APT arena.

The category of “Other” shows a 121% increase in detections,
indicating that APT activities are not limited to the most
frequently cited countries. This diversity highlights the global
nature of cyber threats and the necessity for a wide-ranging and
adaptive cybersecurity posture.
We will be tracking these new patterns closely in the months ahead.

### Targeted countries and regions
This section focuses on the countries regions where Trellix detected
APT related activity by APT groups from Q4 of 2023 through Q1 of
2024, revealing significant shifts in focus and strategy among these
sophisticated cyber actors.

TARGETED COUNTRIES AND REGIONS WITH APT
ASSOCIATED DETECTIONS

| Country | Percentage |
|---|---|
| Turkey | 18.5% |
| India | 16.8% |
| Italy | 16.2% |
| Vietnam | 11.5% |
| United States | 10% |
| Germany | 4.5% |
| China | 2.9% |
| Papau New Guinea | 2.1% |
| Brazil | 2% |
| Indonesia | 1.7% |
| Other | 13.8% |

The data underscores the global nature
of cyber threats and the varying levels
of attention different nations receive
from APT groups.

The Trellix Advanced Research Center
assesses with a moderate level
of confidence that the following factors
impacted activity detected in certain
countries and regions

* Operational objectives:
Detections in threats targeting Turkey
increased by a staggering 1458%, translating to a 16% rise in its
proportional contribution to the total detections. This remarkable
increase indicates a significant shift in cyber threat focus towards
Turkey, possibly reflecting broader geopolitical tensions or specific
operational objectives of the APT groups.
	
* Strategic importance: India and Italy have also experienced
considerable increases in detections, with detections up by 614%
and 308%, respectively. These countries’ rising prominence in the
list of targets may point to their growing strategic importance
in the cyber domain, whether due to economic, political, or
technological factors
	
* Broadening landscape: Interestingly, Vietnam and the United
States, while still generating significant APT detections, have
shown different trends. Vietnam’s detections increased by 9%,
yet its proportional contribution decreased by -9%, indicating a
broadening of the targeting landscape. The United States saw
a moderate increase of 15% in detections but experienced a -7%
drop in its proportional contribution, suggesting a diversification
in the targeting strategies of APT groups.
	
* Geopolitical developments: Germany, China, Papua New Guinea,
and Brazil have all seen increases in detections, with Germany
and China witnessing significant proportional contribution
changes. This diversification in targeting reflects the strategic
and opportunistic adjustments APT groups make in response to
global cybersecurity postures and geopolitical developments.
	
* Enhancement of national security: Conversely, Indonesia
experienced a notable decrease in detections by -48%, coupled
with a -4% drop in its proportional contribution. This reduction
might suggest a temporary deprioritization or a successful
enhancement of national cybersecurity measures.
	
* Consolidation of focus: The “Other” category, representing a
collective of various other countries where Trellix detected APT
related activity, saw a -23% decrease in detections and a -21%
decline in proportional contribution. This decrease highlights a
possible consolidation of focus by APT groups on specific high-
interest targets during this period.

We see potential for the landscape to continue changing rapidly due
to geopolitical trends.

| Other | 12.65% |

The analysis of malicious tools used in APT campaigns from Q4 2023
to Q1 2024 reveals notable trends in the preferences and operational
tactics of cyber threat actors. The variance in detection rates and their
proportional contributions provides insights into the evolving cyber
threat landscape and the shifting dynamics of tool usage among
these sophisticated groups.

The following trends were observed:
	
* Offensive tools getting stronger: Cobalt Strike remains a tool
of choice for many Threat groups, despite a 17% decrease in
detections. Its relatively small decrease in proportional contribution
variance (+1%) suggests it retains its popularity and effectiveness in
cyber operations, underlining the challenge of defending against
versatile and widely used offensive tools.
	
* Reliance on web shells, PowerShell and Remote Access attacks:
China Chopper, PowerSploit, and Gh0st RAT also saw significant
decreases in detections, by 23%, 24%, and 24%, respectively. Despite
these decreases, their slight changes in proportional contribution
variance indicate they remain integral to the toolkit of a threat
actor. These tools, known for their capabilities in web shell attacks,
PowerShell exploits, and remote access, highlight the continued
reliance on proven, versatile tools for cyber operations.
	
* Less detectable tools: Empire, Derusbi, BADFLICK, JJdoor/
Transporter, JumpKick, and MURKYTOP experienced similar
downward trends in detections, all exceeding a 25% decrease.
This uniform decline could reflect a broader shift in the tools
preferred by threat groups or an adaptation to countermeasures
and detection techniques, prompting a move towards newer, less
detectable tools.
	
* Constant innovation: The category of “other” malicious tools saw a
significant increase in detections, up by 30%, and a notable increase
in its proportional contribution variance by 6.00%. This increase
underscores the constant innovation and adaptation among threat
actors, as they explore new tools and techniques to evade detection
and achieve their objectives.

The evolving preferences in malicious tool usage signify
the adaptive nature of cyber threat actors in response to
cybersecurity developments.

The shift towards a broader range of tools, as indicated by the increase
in “Other” detections, highlights the necessity for continuous research,
threat intelligence, and adaptive defense strategies to mitigate the risk
posed by these evolving cyber threats.

### Non-malicious tools
The use of non-malicious tools in cyber operations by APT groups
from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 highlights an important aspect of modern
cyber threats: the leveraging of legitimate system tools for malicious
purposes. This practice, known as “living off the land,” complicates
detection efforts and underscores the sophistication of these threat
actors. The statistics reveal significant variances in the usage of these
tools, reflecting their strategic importance in cyber operations
	
* Versatility: PowerShell has seen a dramatic increase in
detections, up by 105%, with a proportional contribution
variance of 1%. This surge underscores its versatility and power
in automating a wide range of malicious activities, from
reconnaissance to payload delivery.
	
* Focus on network manipulation: Netsh and IPRoyal Pawns have
both seen significant increases in detections, by 99% and 102%,
respectively. These tools are often used for network configuration
and proxy traffic, indicating a strategic focus on network
manipulation and evasion techniques.
	
* Automation to scale: Schtasks.exe has experienced the highest
percentage variance among the tools listed, at 138%. This reflects
the growing reliance on scheduled tasks for persistence and
execution of malicious payloads without direct user intervention.
