Executive SummaryInvesting in crowdsourced security has become an imperative for organizations 
seeking to bolster their cybersecurity defenses. With the increasing frequency 
and sophistication of cyberthreats, traditional security measures alone are often 
insufficient. Bug bounty engagements, among the most popular applications of 
crowdsourcing, offer a proactive approach by harnessing the collective expertise 
of ethical hackers in combination with rewards\-based incentives. They provide an 
ongoing and cost\-effective means of identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, 
ultimately reducing the risk of data breaches and reputational damage. 
Bugcrowd Managed Bug Bounty is a solution on the multipurpose Bugcrowd Platform 
that connects organizations with a global community of ethical hackers and security 
researchers and incentivizes them to identify vulnerabilities that traditional testing will 
generally miss. It provides a managed approach to bug bounty engagements, offering 
end\-to\-end support and expertise to help organizations run their bug bounty initiatives 
effectively. Bugcrowds Managed Bug Bounty solution helps organizations discover and 
address vulnerabilities, enhance their security posture, and reduce the risk of data 
breaches by leveraging the collective intelligence of trusted, skilled hackers in a 
controlled, scalable, and structured manner.
Bugcrowd commissioned Forrester Consulting to conduct a Total Economic Impact 
(TEI) study and examine the potential return on investment (ROI) enterprises may 
realize by deploying Managed Bug Bounty.1 The purpose of this study is to provide 
readers with a framework to evaluate the potential financial impact of Managed Bug 
Bounty on their organizations.Return on investment (ROI)

To better understand the benefits, costs, and risks associated with this investment, 
Forrester interviewed four representatives with experience using Managed Bug Bounty 
and surveyed 39 decision\-makers at the manager level or above who are responsible 
for security strategy, vulnerability management, or security operations at an organization 
that is leveraging ethical hacking engagements. For the purposes of this study, 
Forrester aggregated the interviewees and survey respondents experiences and 
combined the results into a single composite organization that generates $750 million 
in annual revenue and has 5,500 employees. 
Interviewees said that before using Managed Bug Bounty, their organizations primarily 
relied on traditional penetration (pen) tests to identify exploitable vulnerabilities. 
Interviewees organizations also leveraged vulnerability management tools like 
vulnerability scanners, user\-submitted vulnerability programs, or an alternative 
crowdsourced security provider. However, prior attempts yielded limited success, 
leaving them with limited expertise and security resources to effectively manage risk, 
costly traditional penetration test engagements, high noise from legacy solutions that 
created operational burdens, and limited continuous monitoring capabilities.
After the investment in Managed Bug Bounty, the interviewees noted their organizations 
leveraged a mixture of private and public and periodic and continuous bug bounty 
engagements to cover their applications. Public bug bounty programs are open to the 
general public and allow any interested individual to participate, while private bug 
bounty programs are invitation\-only or restricted to a specific group of individuals. Key 
results from the investment include improved security operations efficiency, avoided 
traditional penetration test costs, material breach risk reduction savings, and reduced 
cybersecurity insurance premiums.EXECUTIVE SUMMARYTHE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY 
5KEY FINDINGS 
Quantified benefits. Three\-year, risk\-adjusted present value (PV) quantified benefits 
for the composite organization include: 
 Improved security operations efficiency and avoided hiring two FTEs. 
Bugcrowds Managed Bug Bounty engagement pairs the composite organization 
with experienced ethical hackers to identify high\-confidence vulnerabilities that 
may have been missed by internal security teams and tools in the composites 
legacy environment. By providing actionable and triaged findings, Bugcrowd 
eliminates the need for manual triaging work, freeing up the time and resources 
of the composites internal security team. This improves coverage and reduces 
risk without the need to increase headcount. With the Managed Bug Bounty 
engagement in place, the composite reallocates existing security teams time to 
focus on remediating high\-risk priorities and strategic tasks and avoids hiring 
additional internal security resources to gain the same level of coverage that 
Bugcrowd provides. The composite organization saves $819,000 in avoided 
hiring and overhead costs over three years.

 Avoided 60% of traditional penetration test costs. The composite 
organization leverages Bugcrowd to supplement and enhance its penetration 
testing efforts. Managed Bug Bounty engagements offer continuous, clear, and 
actionable insights into high\-impact vulnerabilities within the composites 
environment, giving its security team a more comprehensive approach to 
identifying and addressing vulnerabilities. As a result, the composite reduces the 
frequency and scope of traditional penetration tests, leading to $552,000 in cost 
savings over three years. 
 Reduced risk of a material breach by up to 30%. The composite organization 
effectively reduces the risk of data breaches by leveraging Managed Bug Bounty 
engagements. With Bugcrowd, the composite increases its chances of identifying 
vulnerabilities that might have been overlooked in previous environments. The 
Managed Bug Bounty engagements also facilitate faster response times by 
incentivizing prompt reporting of vulnerabilities, leading to quicker fixes and 
minimizing the potential window of opportunity for malicious attackers. 
Furthermore, the continuous nature of the Managed Bug Bounty engagements 
provides a consistent mechanism for ongoing vulnerability identification and 
remediation, resulting in a gradual reduction of vulnerabilities within the 
composite organizations systems over time. The composite organization avoids 
$528,000 of breach costs over three years. 
 Reduced cybersecurity insurance premium costs by 9%. The Managed Bug 
Bounty engagement contributes to lower cyber insurance premium costs for the 
composite organization. This engagement demonstrates a proactive approach to 
security risk management, which signals to insurers that the composite is taking 
measures to mitigate potential cyberthreats. Insurers may view organizations 
with bug bounty engagements as having better security hygiene and reduced risk 
profile and are less likely to experience a data breach. As a result, insurers may 
offer lower premium costs as they perceive the composite to be a lower risk. The 
composite organization saves $57,000 of cyber insurance premium costs over 
three years. 
Unquantified benefits. Benefits that provide value for the composite organization 
but are not quantified for this study include:
EXECUTIVE SUMMARYTHE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY 
7 
 Shorter time to remediation. Managed Bug Bounty engagements lead to 
shorter vulnerability remediation times for the composite than alternative 
solutions. 
 Improved relationship between developers and security due to better 
communication. Managed Bug Bounty bridges communication gaps between 
security and developer teams, allowing for more robust security processes. 
 Improved reputation and demonstration of security maturity. Bugcrowd 
demonstrates security maturity, bolstering brand and reputation from the vantage 
point of customers, partners, auditors, and other third\-party stakeholders. 
 Improved compliance reporting. Bugcrowd demonstrates security posture 
health to regulators and speeds up reporting processes. 
 Effective researcher pairing and strong vendor support. Managed Bug 
Bounty provides high\-quality and effective researchers, AI algorithms, and 
required data for sourcing and activating specific skill sets, program 
management, and overall vendor support. This results in higher accuracy, fewer 
false positives, and more edge cases identified for the composite organization. 
 Flexibility to adapt to changing threat environments without new hires or 
onboarding new tools. Managed Bug Bounty engagements give access to 
scalable and diverse talent to provide cost\-effective and timely response to new 
threats and security standards. This addition to security risk management 
engagements allows the composite to forgo onboarding of additional new hires 
and tools. 
Costs. Three\-year, risk\-adjusted PV costs for the composite organization include:
 Platform and reward pool costs of $522,000 over three years. Bugcrowd 
Managed Bug Bounty consists of a platform fee and payments in a rewards pool 
that are reserved to incentivize and payout to researchers. Platform fees and 
reward pools vary depending on sizing and requirements. Contact Bugcrowd for 
additional details. 
 Implementation and change management costs of less than $9,000\. 
Forrester accounts for upfront internal labor hours dedicated to implementation 
and change management.

The Bugcrowd Managed Bug Bounty Customer Journey 
Drivers leading to the Managed Bug Bounty investmentKEY CHALLENGES 
Forrester interviewed four representatives with experience using Bugcrowd Managed 
Bug Bounty at their organization and surveyed 39 respondents with experience using a 
crowdsourced security vendor, 54% of whom had experience using Bugcrowd. Our 
survey found that 69% of respondents noted their organization used private 
engagements across an average of 543 assets. For more details on the interviewees 
and survey respondents, see Appendix B.
Before Bugcrowd Managed Bug Bounty, interviewees and survey respondents noted 
their organizations primarily relied on traditional penetration tests to identify exploitable 
vulnerabilities. Interviewees organizations also leveraged vulnerability management 
tools like vulnerability scanners, self\-managed vulnerability disclosure programs, or an 
alternative crowdsourced security provider.
The interviewees noted how their organizations struggled with common challenges, 
including: 
 Limited expertise and security resources. Interviewees told Forrester their 
organizations lacked the security knowledge and resources to identify, triage, and 
address vulnerabilities. Existing security personnel were already fully utilized with 
the existing volume of vulnerabilities to address, and hiring additional resources 
was cost\-prohibitive.
 Traditional penetration test engagements were costly and yielded limited 
success. Interviewees told Forrester that traditional penetration tests were 
expensive, particularly for smaller organizations with limited budgets. Planning, 
executing, and managing results from traditional penetration test engagements 
was time\-consuming. The quality between providers varied, and assessments 
missed or failed to prioritize exploitable vulnerabilities. Finally, interviewees 
struggled to retest and verify fixes in their environments until the next 
engagement after remediating issues. The senior director of information security 
CUSTOMER JOURNEYTHE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY 
13 
and IT at an automotive organization said: Prior to \[Managed Bug Bounty], we 
had paid testing engagements with third\-party vendors. As you can imagine, 
thats expensive, and you pay for a testers time instead of per finding.The head of information security at a healthcare organization stated: It takes a 
long time to do an annual pen test and you might not have a checkpoint between 
those 365 days to see how youre progressing from an external attacker 
perspective. You might have an internal security team monitoring application 
security or internal SaaS \[software\-as\-a\-service] tools, but theres no substitute 
for having talented researchers assess your infrastructure from an external 
perspective.
 High noise from legacy solutions created an operational burden. 
Interviewees stated that legacy vendor tools, traditional penetration tests, user 
submissions, and legacy crowdsourced security solutions generated false 
positives, duplicates, and other noise, creating additional triaging work for 
already resource\-constrained security teams. The senior director of information 
security and IT at an automotive organization said: There was a high amount of 
noise from \[our legacy crowdsourced security partner]. It takes someone who is 
paid well to sit there, sort out findings, and respond to the researcher. Its a back\-
and\-forth, they complain, and you have to go through it. None of that is our 
burden with Bugcrowd. Bugcrowd effectively manages the community regarding 
expectations and gives customers guidance on how to respond and engage with 
them.
 Incomplete coverage and lack of continuous monitoring. Before Bugcrowd, 
interviewees organizations lacked continuous, red\-teaming coverage across their 
systems, platforms, and technologies, leaving them susceptible to attacks. The 
head of information security at a healthcare organization stated: \[Before 
Bugcrowd,] vulnerabilities were not being found because humans are much more 
creative in finding vulnerabilities than automated systems are. Those 
vulnerabilities would go undiscovered for long periods without Managed Bug 
Bounty.

WHY BUGCROWD MANAGED BUG BOUNTY? 
Interviewees and survey respondents noted their organizations required a cost\-effective 
solution to identify and triage vulnerabilities, lower risk, and harden security posture. 
The interviewees organizations searched for a solution that could: 
 Leverage expert hackers to keep pace with a quickly evolving threat 
landscape and to help identify high\-risk vulnerabilities. The head of 
information security at a healthcare organization said: The \[cybersecurity] field 
and types of vulnerabilities and hacking emerging is moving super fast. Its 
important to have intelligent researchers who are tapped into everything thats 
going on in that sense and are up to date on the latest vulnerabilities, techniques, 
and procedures. Thats one of the most important pieces of using a 
crowdsourced bug bounty.The senior director of information security and IT at an automotive organization 
said: Because Bugcrowd is community\-based, we benefit from many different 
perspectives. Thats an intrinsic component of the platform itself. Even though we 
continue to partner with a single vendor, we benefit from the fresh perspective of 
many different researchers as an individual.
 Augment traditional penetration tests and vulnerability scanners to 
increase coverage and insights and reduce cost. The head of information 
security at a healthcare organization said: One of the key things you dont have 
without a bug bounty engagement is the ongoing support and monitoring from an 
external perspective and from humans specifically, not just automated tools.
 Improve operational efficiency with support from the Managed Bug Bounty 
team. The senior manager of application security at a technology organization 
stated: We are still growing our security maturity. Bugcrowd makes sense 
because we can get much greater coverage of our environment and systems. Its 
more efficient.The same interviewee stated: The Bugcrowd Platform has been pretty 
successful in helping our engineers and application owners understand the 
impact of vulnerabilities and how they manifest themselves in the outside world. 
It takes things from the theoretical, where we find the potential vulnerabilities in 
CUSTOMER JOURNEYTHE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY 
15 
SaaS tools and things like that and makes them more real. Its been a good 
partnership. 
After a request for proposal (RFP) and business case process evaluating multiple 
vendors, the interviewees organizations chose Managed Bug Bounty and began 
deployment: 
 Interviewees leveraged Managed Bug Bounty to cover external services and 
customer\-facing applications.
 Interviewees ran either continuous or periodic bug bounty engagements. 
 All interviewees ran private engagements; one interviewee combined public and 
private ones.Our partnership with Bugcrowd has been invaluable. Instead 
of paying per hour, you pay per actionable finding. That is a 
major differentiator because security expertise is not cheap 
and can take many hours.SENIOR DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND IT, AUTOMOTIVECOMPOSITE ORGANIZATION 
Based on the interviews and survey, Forrester constructed a TEI framework, a 
composite company, and an ROI analysis that illustrates the areas financially affected. 
The composite organization is representative of the four interviewees and 39 
respondents, and it is used to present the aggregate financial analysis in the next 
section. The composite organization has the following characteristics:
CUSTOMER JOURNEYTHE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY 
16 
Description of composite. The composite organization is a United States\-based 
company that generates $750 million in annual revenue and employs 5,500 employees. 
On the security side, the composite employs four security operations (SecOps) FTEs 
who are responsible for all vulnerability management engagements, including Managed 
Bug Bounty. The composite leverages external traditional penetration tests to find 
vulnerabilities.
Deployment characteristics. The composite invests in a Bugcrowd Managed Bug 
Bounty engagement with Bugcrowd to augment traditional penetration tests and expand 
its vulnerability management maturity. The composite begins with continuous, private 
bug bounty engagements across its customer\-facing assets. As it runs and manages 
engagements proficiently, the composite expands to public bug bounty engagements.

Evidence and data. According to interviewees, Bugcrowds Managed Bug Bounty 
solution effectively paired experienced, ethical hackers with organizations to identify 
high\-confidence vulnerabilities that internal security teams and tools may have missed. 
By providing actionable and triaged findings, Bugcrowd eliminated the need for manual 
triaging work, freeing up the time and resources of internal security teams. With the 
Managed Bug Bounty engagement in place, interviewees organizations could reallocate 
their existing security teams time to focus on strategic initiatives and avoid hiring 
additional internal security resources to gain the same coverage that Bugcrowd 
provides. This resulted in improved coverage and reduced risk. Interviewees and survey 
respondent provided the following evidence:
 The senior director of information security and IT at an automotive organization 
said: Its much cheaper to pay Bugcrowd engineers than if we were to open a 
position for an FTE to satisfy that same requirement. The value proposition is 
incredible on multiple fronts. We have our internal engineers focusing on things 
that deliver higher ROI and not just waiting for report submissions. Then 
ANALYSIS OF BENEFITSTHE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY 
18 
Bugcrowd handles the triage, and we only pay researchers when they provide 
actionable findings. Were not paying them per hour, regardless of their findings. 
They are strongly incentivized to have meaningful submissions. The same 
interviewee said, I would need a staff of at least 15 FTEs, probably costing 
$200,000 to $250,000 each, to have the same level of engagement and testing 
that Bugcrowd provides. 
 The senior manager of application security at a technology organization stated, 
By outsourcing to Managed Bug Bounty, my internal resources can focus on 
remediation and helping the internal teams fix things rather than just looking and 
sifting through all the submissions looking for the good ones. The same 
interviewee estimated: If we didnt have \[Bugcrowds] Bug Bounty program, wed 
have to hire more internal penetration testing resources to replicate that 
coverage. We would probably have to hire at least three folks to get to any 
accepted level of coverage.
 The head of information security at a healthcare organization stated: Given that 
we dont have a dedicated internal application security team, \[Bugcrowd] has 
helped insofar as we dont have to have full\-time employees that are charged 
with this task, and we can rely on the more cost\-effective approach to testing. A 
seasoned security engineer can cost around $150,000 per year. To have the 
same level of support \[as we do with Bugcrowd], wed need a couple of them.
 Our survey found that 21 out of 25 survey respondents were able to 
reassignsave at least two FTEs as a result of their organizations crowdsourced 
security engagements. 
ANALYSIS OF BENEFITSTHE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY 
19The benefit we get from leveraging the external research 
community is we have folks in that community who have deep 
expertise in various areas. Each of them can focus on and 
look for the types of issues that theyre most efficient at 
finding. It makes the overall vulnerability identification piece 
more cost effective for us than trying to cover that with 
internal resources, given that were a small team.SENIOR MANAGER OF APPLICATION SECURITY, TECHNOLOGYModeling and assumptions. Based on the interviews and survey, Forrester assumes 
the following about the composite organization: 
 The composite organization dedicates four security operations FTEs who 
oversee vulnerability management, including the Bugcrowd Managed Bug 
Bounty engagement. 
 The composite organization requires a 50% increase in SecOps staff for triaging 
and to provide vulnerability remediation guidance without Bugcrowd.
 The annual fully burdened rate for a SecOps FTE is $130,950, including a 1\.35 
fully burdened multiplier. 
 The hiring cost for a SecOps FTE is calculated by multiplying the fully burdened 
rate with a 131% hiring cost multiplier. 
Risks. Forrester recognizes that these results may not be representative of all 
experiences. The impact of this benefit will vary depending on:

Evidence and data. Interviewees noted their organizations found traditional penetration 
tests expensive, resource\-intensive, and unable to verify fixes promptly. To address 
these limitations, interviewees turned to Bugcrowd to supplement and enhance their 
penetration testing efforts. They quickly realized that the Managed Bug Bounty 
engagements offered continuous, clear, and actionable insights into high\-impact 
vulnerabilities within their environment. By leveraging Bugcrowds insights, interviewees 
organizations gained a more efficient and cost\-effective approach to identifying and 
addressing vulnerabilities in their systems. As a result, the interviewees organizations 
reduced the frequency or scope of traditional penetration tests, leading to significant 
cost savings. Interviewees and survey respondents provided the following evidence:
 The senior director of information security and IT at an automotive organization 
said, For less than $100,000, we had more findings in 60 days when we had 
over multiple years of paid \[traditional penetration test] engagements at an order 
of magnitude higher cost. The senior director continued: We have largely 
replaced most of our third\-party pen testing spend with Bugcrowd. We saved 
ANALYSIS OF BENEFITSTHE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY 
22 
$350,000 by changing our approach to application security testing by third 
parties. Instead of engaging a vendor on an ad hoc basis every year, we have a 
continuous bounty program that operates 247, 365 days a year, with the same 
results. 
 Nine out of 15 survey respondents said their organization saved between 
$250,000 to $749,000 by reducing or replacing pen testing or other security 
solutions or processes. This averages out to $320,000\. 
Modeling and assumptions. Based on the interviews and survey, Forrester assumes 
the following about the composite organization: 
 The composite analysis paid $500,000 to conduct traditional penetration tests in 
the legacy environment.
 The composite organization augments its traditional penetration testing with 
Managed Bug Bounty. After doing so, the composite reduces 40% of traditional 
pen test usage and costs in Year 1, 50% in Year 2, and 60% in Year 3 as the 
organizations proficiency and efficacy with Managed Bug Bounty engagements 
matures. 
 This results in $200,000 of cost savings in Year 1, $250,000 in Year 2, and 
$300,000 in Year 3\. 
Risks. Forrester recognizes that these results may not be representative of all 
experiences. The impact of this benefit will vary depending on: 
 Security and vulnerability management maturity. 
 Frequency, scope, and cost of traditional penetration tests. 
 Compliance requirements. 
Results. To account for these risks, Forrester adjusted this benefit downward by 10%,

MATERIAL BREACH RISK REDUCTION SAVINGS 
Evidence and data. Interviewees told Forrester that Managed Bug Bounty 
engagements effectively reduced the risk of data breaches. By engaging ethical hackers 
and security researchers, interviewees organizations increased their chances of 
identifying vulnerabilities that might have been overlooked in previous environments. 
The Managed Bug Bounty engagements also facilitated faster response times by 
incentivizing prompt reporting of vulnerabilities, leading to quicker fixes and minimizing 
the potential window of opportunity for malicious attackers. Furthermore, the continuous 
nature of these Managed Bug Bounty engagements provided a consistent mechanism 
for ongoing vulnerability identification and remediation, resulting in a gradual reduction 
of vulnerabilities within the interviewees organizations systems over time. Interviewees 
and survey respondents provided the following evidence: 
 The senior manager of application security noted their technology organization 
reduced the number of critical vulnerabilities by 60% with Managed Bug Bounty. 
The interviewee told Forrester: Were improving the overall security posture via 
the Managed Bug Bounty program because we know were finding out about 
vulnerabilities faster, closing them faster, and shortening the exposure window. 
Thats the main way we demonstrate the value here.
 The head of information security at a healthcare organization said: There have 
been discoveries from the Managed Bug Bounty program that were related to 
data leakage and therefore were avoided, which could have potentially led to 
undesired disclosure of information. It was a very important finding. 
\[Bugcrowd] has substantially lowered the risk of a breach.
 The senior director of information security at an automotive organization 
explained: Bugcrowd is now probably 10% of our overall application security 
findings. But in the programs first year, it was easily 95%. Most of our findings for 
the programs first year were attributed to Bugcrowd because the body of 
researchers that we had engaged were providing a lot of really clever and novel 
threat techniques that effectively found gaps in our security posture.
 Sixteen out of 24 respondents who reduced priority 1 (P1\) or critical 
vulnerabilities, incidents, or security breaches had found two or more critical or 
ANALYSIS OF BENEFITSTHE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY 
25 
P1 vulnerabilities per month with their organizations crowdsourced security 
engagements. 
 Twenty\-four respondents were able to reduce the likelihood of security breach, 
on average, by 33% with their organizations crowdsourced security 
engagements.
 Fourteen out of 24 respondentswho reduced priority 1 (P1\) or critical 
vulnerabilities, incidents, or security breaches estimated that the average 
financial impact from a P1 was $250,000\.The quality of the findings is very high because Bugcrowd 
researchers give very detailed instructions on how to 
duplicate the vulnerability and how to assess it. Then you also 
have the benefit of having them being able to retest the 
vulnerabilities after theyve been fixed to make sure that 
theyve been remediated. Theyre typically also very easy to 
collaborate and work with via the platform.HEAD OF INFORMATION SECURITY, HEALTHCAREANALYSIS OF BENEFITSTHE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY 
26Modeling and assumptions. Based on the interviews and survey, Forrester assumes 
the following about the composite organization: 
 The composite organization is susceptible to 4\.7 material data breaches on 
average, per year.2 
 Nearly half (49\.1%) of the data breaches originate from external attacks.3 
 The average cost of each breach is $466,000, which may include response and 
remediation costs, efforts to notify affected parties, regulatory fines, customer 
lawsuits, downtime, and more.4 
 By utilizing Bugcrowd Managed Bug Bounty engagements, the composite 
organization reduces the likelihood of a material security breach by 20% in Year 
1, 25% in Year 2, and 30% in Year 3\. The reduction in likelihood increases year 
over year as the composite organizations proficiency and efficacy with Managed 
Bug Bounty engagements matures.

Evidence and data. Interviewees told Forrester that having Managed Bug Bounty 
engagements contributed to lower cyber insurance premium costs. By actively engaging 
ethical hackers and security researchers to identify vulnerabilities in their systems, the 
interviewees organizations demonstrated a proactive approach to security risk 
management. Interviewees noted that this proactive stance signaled to insurers that 
their organizations were taking measures to mitigate potential cyberthreats. Because of 
this, insurers viewed the interviewees organizations with bug bounty engagements as 
having better security hygiene and reduced risk profile and were less likely to 
experience a data breach. As a result, insurers may offer lower premium costs as they 
perceived the interviewees organization to be a lower risk. Interviewees stated that the 
reduced likelihood and potential impact of a data breach and lower risk profile further 
contributed to reduced insurance premiums. Interviewees and survey respondents 
provided the following evidence: 
 The senior director of information security and IT at an automotive company told 
Forrester: Weve had a significant increase in our security posture, and weve 
been able to recognize substantial savings on our cybersecurity assurance 
premiums as a result of not only Bugcrowd but all the other good work that weve 
ANALYSIS OF BENEFITSTHE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY 
29 
done and moving forward and maturing our security posture. I would say we save 
around 40% on our premium. Bugcrowd is a significant component of our 
application security testing program and probably accounts for one\-third of our 
overall security posture and impact because all the vulnerabilities, data 
disclosures, or breaches happen at the application layer. 
 Twelve out of 18 survey respondents whose crowdsourced security engagement 
impacted cyber insurance premiums said their organization paid more than 
$250,000 in annual cyber security insurance premiums prior to its crowdsourced 
security engagement. Eleven out of 18 survey respondents said their 
organization reduced cybersecurity insurance premiums by three to less than 
10% due to using a crowdsourced security engagement. 
Modeling and assumptions. Based on the interviews, Forrester assumes the following 
about the composite organization: 
 The composite organization pays $300,000 a year in cybersecurity insurance 
premiums in its legacy environment. 
 The composite organization reduces its cyber insurance premiums by 9% due to 
Bugcrowd, saving $27,000 annually. 
Risks. Forrester recognizes that these results may not be representative of all 
experiences. The impact of this benefit will vary depending on: 
 Internal security maturity. 
 Cybersecurity insurance premium costs, which vary depending on scope, assets, 
and more. 
Results. To account for these risks, Forrester adjusted this benefit downward by 15%, 
yielding a three\-year, risk\-adjusted total PV (discounted at 10%) of $57,000\.ANALYSIS OF BENEFITSTHE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY

UNQUANTIFIED BENEFITS 
Interviewees mentioned the following additional benefits that their organizations 
experienced but were not able to quantify: 
 Shorter time to remediation. Several interviewees noted that insights provided 
by Managed Bug Bounty led to shorter vulnerability remediation times than 
solutions in their organizations prior environments. The head of information 
security at a healthcare organization said, So much of the research and 
discovery is handled by Bugcrowd and then the remediation advice gets us 80% 
to 90% of the way there for how to fix the vulnerability. Additionally, 19 survey 
respondents improved patching efficiency by 63% on average and improved 
efficiency retesting vulnerabilities by 66% on average with their organizations 
crowdsourced security engagement. 
o The senior manager of application security at a technology organization 
said: Our confidence level from Managed Bug Bounty far exceeds any 
other detection mechanism we have. Thats one of the areas where it 
provides a lot of value for us because we can immediately start working 
with a team on vulnerabilities. We dont need to do additional work to vet 
findings.
 Improved relationship between developers and security due to better 
communication. Interviewees noted that Managed Bug Bounty helped bridge 
communication gaps between security and developer teams, allowing for more 
robust security processes. The head of information security at a healthcare 
organization said: \[The relationship between developers and security] has 
improved because its evident that the security team is concerned with the quality 
of our products, and \[having Bugcrowd] allows us to communicate more 
frequently about security issues. It also highlights the importance of staying on 
top of our security posture. It creates more opportunities for ongoing 
conversations with our engineering teams and application owners.
 Improved reputation and demonstration of security maturity. Interviewees 
and survey respondents reported that Bugcrowd helped demonstrate security 
maturity, bolstering their brand and reputation from the vantage point of 
customers, partners, auditors, and other third\-party stakeholders. Sixty\-four 
ANALYSIS OF BENEFITSTHE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY 
32 
percent of respondents strongly agreed that their organizations crowdsourced 
security program builds their organizations brand confidence; 59% strongly 
agreed that their organization has improved customer retention or growth with 
security. The senior director of information security at an automotive company 
said: A bug bounty program, or at least a vulnerability disclosure program, is 
now the new table stakes for vendor evaluations. I would think negatively of them 
if they dont have that.
 Improved compliance reporting. Interviewees said Bugcrowd demonstrated 
security posture health to regulators and sped up reporting processes. The head 
of information security at a healthcare organization said: \[Having Bugcrowd] 
helps to show that we take security seriously and satisfy regulatory reporting 
requirements for SOC 2 that has penetration testing requirements, and so does 
HIPAA, even if theres no reporting requirement there. We save 10 to 15 hours 
annually \[on reporting].
 Effective researcher pairing and strong vendor support. Interviewees said 
Managed Bug Bounty provided high\-quality and effective researchers, AI 
algorithms, and required data for sourcing and activating specific skill sets, 
program management, and overall vendor support. This resulted in higher 
accuracy, fewer false positives, and more edge cases identified. The head of 
information security at a healthcare organization said: I have found that the 
researchers that Ive been paired with via Bugcrowd and their secret sauce 
platform have resulted in very high\-quality interactions with their researchers. The 
communication has been very fast and efficient. The same interviewee said: Im 
thrilled to have Bugcrowd in my corner. Theyre an essential part of keeping our 
organization and our customers data safe. Im very glad that theyre my partner.
 Flexibility to adapt to changing threat environments without new hires or 
onboarding new tools. Interviewees noted that Managed Bug Bounty 
engagements gave them access to scalable, diverse talent to provide cost 
effective and timely response to threats. This addition to their security risk 
management program allowed interviewees organizations to forgo onboarding 
additional new hires and tools. The head of information security in a healthcare 
organization said, \[Bugcrowd] is competitive and cost\-effective with an increase 
in quality from what Ive seen in the market, which is quite amazing.
ANALYSIS OF BENEFITSTHE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY 
33Its often difficult for developers to understand all the ways 
hackers can abuse our systems. When the Bugcrowd 
researchers submit their submissions with sometimes very 
creative findings, it helps our engineering teams better 
understand how to protect the next update or change they will 
make next.SENIOR MANAGER OF APPLICATION SECURITY, TECHNOLOGYFLEXIBILITY 
The value of flexibility is unique to each customer. There are multiple scenarios in which 
a customer might implement Managed Bug Bounty and later realize additional uses and 
business opportunities, including:
 Opportunities to expand bug bounty engagement type and cadence. 
Interviewees noted that Bugcrowd provides several paths to expand bug bounty 
engagements to maximize value. Organizations can choose between periodic or 
continuous engagements; to test preproduction environments or production 
environments; to run engagements privately or publicly; and to evolve toward a 
fully open scope for testing. This flexibility allows organizations to tailor Managed 
Bug Bounty services for specific security needs. The head of information security 
at a healthcare organization said: My projection and intent is to launch a 
continuous Bug Bounty engagement in 2024, a private Bug Bounty engagement 
that ideally will evolve to a public Bug Bounty engagement in the following year 
or two. Thats a good progression for leveraging Bug Bounty. Once you get to the 
point where you can leverage a public Bug Bounty engagement, youre really 
ANALYSIS OF BENEFITSTHE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY 
34 
demonstrating that youre working with the security community and also taking 
your security posture very seriously.
 Increase internal awareness of the importance of continuous security 
testing. Conveying the importance of a rigorous security programs can be 
difficult. The head of information security at a healthcare organization told 
Forrester that using Managed Bug Bounty helped elevate that message: \[Using 
Bugcrowd] has internally elevated the awareness of the importance of continually 
testing the security of your product. Every time that we run a Bug Bounty, theres 
a lot of internal communication about it and it conveys the fact that we care a 
great deal about our security posture. As a result, it has raised the security 
awareness of the entire organization, which is one of the positive side effects that 
I maybe wouldnt have thought of but I certainly welcome. It makes security an 
ongoing conversation in the leadership level of the organization.
Flexibility would also be quantified when evaluated as part of a specific project 
(described in more detail in Appendix A).ANALYSIS OF BENEFITSTHE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY

Evidence and data. Interviewees told Forrester that the change management and 
implementation to launch their organizations Managed Bug Bounty engagements were 
low effort. The senior director of information security and IT at an automotive 
organization told Forrester: We spent 40 hours combined starting up our Bug Bounty 
program, very low effort. Its a white\-glove experience. They are good at what they do. 
They do this all the time, making it very easy and convenient and saying its almost

Modeling and assumptions. Based on the interviews and survey, Forrester assumes 
the following about the composite organization: 
 The composite organization handles all change management and 
implementation requirements to begin its continuous Managed Bug Bounty 
engagements with three SecOps FTEs who dedicate 40 hours each.

APPENDIX A: TOTAL ECONOMIC IMPACT 
Total Economic Impact is a methodology developed by Forrester Research that 
enhances a companys technology decision\-making processes and assists vendors in 
communicating the value proposition of their products and services to clients. The TEI 
methodology helps companies demonstrate, justify, and realize the tangible value of IT 
initiatives to both senior management and other key business stakeholders. 
Total Economic Impact Approach 
Benefits represent the value delivered to the business by the product. The TEI 
methodology places equal weight on the measure of benefits and the measure of costs, 
allowing for a full examination of the effect of the technology on the entire organization.
Costs consider all expenses necessary to deliver the proposed value, or benefits, of the 
product. The cost category within TEI captures incremental costs over the existing 
environment for ongoing costs associated with the solution.
Flexibility represents the strategic value that can be obtained for some future additional 
investment building on top of the initial investment already made. Having the ability to 
capture that benefit has a PV that can be estimated.
Risks measure the uncertainty of benefit and cost estimates given: 1\) the likelihood that 
estimates will meet original projections and 2\) the likelihood that estimates will be 
tracked over time. TEI risk factors are based on triangular distribution. 
PRESENT VALUE (PV) 
The present or current value of (discounted) cost and benefit estimates given at an interest 
rate (the discount rate). The PV of costs and benefits feed into the total NPV of cash flows.
NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV) 
The present or current value of (discounted) future net cash flows given an interest rate (the 
discount rate). A positive project NPV normally indicates that the investment should be made 
unless other projects have higher NPVs.THE T OT AL EC ONOMIC IMPACT OF BUGCROWD M AN AGED BUG B OUNTY 
40 
RETURN ON INVESTMENT (ROI) 
A projects expected return in percentage terms. ROI is calculated by dividing net benefits 
(benefits less costs) by costs.
DISCOUNT RATE 
The interest rate used in cash flow analysis to take into account the time value of money. 
Organizations typically use discount rates between 8% and 16%.
PAYBACK PERIOD 
The breakeven point for an investment. This is the point in time at which net benefits 
(benefits minus costs) equal initial investment or cost. 
The initial investment column contains costs incurred at time 0 or at the beginning of 
Year 1 that are not discounted. All other cash flows are discounted using the discount 
rate at the end of the year. PV calculations are calculated for each total cost and benefit 
estimate. NPV calculations in the summary tables are the sum of the initial investment 
and the discounted cash flows in each year. Sums and present value calculations of the 
Total Benefits, Total Costs, and Cash Flow tables may not exactly add up, as some 
rounding may occur.APPENDIX B: INTERVIEW AND SURVEY DEMOGRAPHICS
