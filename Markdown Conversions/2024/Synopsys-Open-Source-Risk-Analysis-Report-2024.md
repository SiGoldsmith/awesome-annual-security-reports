This report offers recommendations to help creators and consumers of open source software manage it responsibly, especially in the context of securing the software supply chain. Whether a consumer or provider of software, you are part of the software supply chain, and need to safeguard the applications you use from upstream as well as downstream risk. In the following pages, we examine
*   Persistent open source security concerns
*   Why developers need to improve at keeping open source components up-to-date
*   The need for a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for software supply chain management
*   How to protect against the security and IP compliance risk introduced by AI coding tools

For nearly a decade, the major theme of the “Open Source Security and Risk Analysis” (OSSRA) report has been *Do you know what’s in your code?* In 2024, it’s a question more important than ever before. With the prevalence of open source and the rise in AI-generated code, more and more applications are now built with third-party code.

Without a complete view of what’s in your code, neither you, your vendors, nor your end users can be confident about what risks your software may contain. Securing the software supply chain begins with knowing what open source components are in your code, as well as identifying their respective licenses, code quality, and potential vulnerabilities.

## About the 2024 OSSRA

In this, its ninth edition, the 2024 OSSRA report delivers an in-depth look at the current state of open source security, compliance, licensing, and code quality risks in commercial software. The findings in this report are presented with the goal of helping security, legal, risk, and development teams better understand the open source security and license risk landscape.

This report uses data from the Synopsys Black Duck® Audit Services team’s analysis of anonymized findings from 1,067 commercial codebases across 17 industries during 2023. The Audit Services team has helped security, development, and legal teams around the world strengthen their security and license compliance programs for over 20 years. The team audits thousands of codebases for our customers each year, with the primary aim of identifying software risks during merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions.

The audits also provide a comprehensive, accurate Software Bill of Materials covering the open source, third-party code, web services, and application programming interfaces (APIs) in an organization’s applications. The Audit Services team relies on data from the Black Duck KnowledgeBase™ to identify potential license compliance and security risks. Sourced and curated by the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center (CyRC), the KnowledgeBase includes data on more than 7.8 million open source components from over 31,000 forges and repositories.

The OSSRA report highlights the prevalence of open source in software as well as the potential dangers of not properly managing it. Open source is the foundation for all applications that businesses and consumers rely on today. Identifying, tracking, and managing open source effectively is critical to a successful software security program—as well as a key element to strengthening the security of the software supply chain.

**Image Description:** A bar chart showing the percentage of codebases containing code originating from open source and the percentage of codebases containing open source, broken down by industry. Each industry has two bars, one for each percentage.

Of the 1,067 codebases analyzed by the Black Duck Audit Services team and used as the base data for this year’s OSSRA report, 96% contained open source. Seventy-seven percent of all the source code and files scanned originated from open source code.

The average number of open source components in a given application this year was 526—a practical example of the importance if not absolute necessity for automated security testing. Manual testing, which might be feasible for a small number of components, becomes virtually impossible at scale and requires the use of an automated solution like software composition analysis (SCA). Unlike manual testing, automated security tests can be executed quickly and consistently, allowing developers to identify issues early in the development process without impacting delivery schedules or productivity.

Eighty-four percent of codebases that included a risk assessment contained at least one known open source vulnerability. Seventy-four percent of those codebases contained high-risk vulnerabilities, a significant increase from 2022, when only 48% of the codebases were found to contain high-risk vulnerabilities. High-risk vulnerabilities are those that have been actively exploited, already have documented proof-of-concept exploits, or are classified as remote code execution vulnerabilities.

There’s no single answer for the 54% increase (26 percentage points) in high-risk vulnerabilities between 2022 and 2023. One possible explanation is the economic downturn and consequent layoffs, which reduced the number of resources available to locate and patch vulnerabilities. Additionally, 91% of the codebases were found to contain components 10 versions or more behind the most current available version of the component. The simple conclusion is that the vast majority of open source consumers simply aren’t updating the components they use.

Forty-nine percent of the codebases contained components that had no development activity within the past 24 months, and 1% had components at least 12 months behind on code maintainer updates/patches.

Broadly, the term “maintainers” refers to those contributors who lead an open source project. They may be the final decision-makers on which portions of source code go into a build or release, they may do all the code review and host the code under their names for smaller projects, and they may make the ultimate decision over the direction of a project. Their day-to-day work may vary but it can consist of reviewing pull requests and other contributions, releasing new versions of software, triaging and handling security fixes, and community management and moderation.

**A Note on the Audits**

All Black Duck audits examine open source license compliance. Customers can opt out of the vulnerability/operational risk assessment portion of the audit at their discretion. During 2023, the Black Duck Audit Services team conducted 1,067 audits. Of those audits, 88% (936) also underwent a vulnerability/operational risk assessment. The data in the “Open Source Vulnerabilities and Security” and “Operational Factors Affecting Open Source Risk” sections of the 2024 OSSRA report is based on the 936 codebases that included risk assessments. The data in the “Open Source Licensing” section is based on all 1,067 codebases.

## Open Source Vulnerabilities and Security

*   54% increase in codebases containing high-risk vulnerabilities in the past year
    *   74% (2023)
    *   48% (2022)
*   84% of codebases contained at least one open source vulnerability

Most maintainers are diligent about keeping the open source projects they’re involved with up-to-date. In fact, many companies specifically hire people to maintain open source projects the organization’s software relies upon. The same diligence needs to be encouraged in open source consumers. Consumers of open source need to stay aware of the versions they have in use, establish a regular cadence for updates, and practice software hygiene when it comes to open source—only downloading from projects with a healthy ecosystem of maintainers and contributors.

Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) are popular lists used to identify and classify security weaknesses and vulnerabilities in software. Black Duck Security Advisories (BDSAs) are Synopsys proprietary reports designed to provide customers with timelier and more detailed information at a higher level than National Vulnerability Database (NVD) CVE notices. BDSAs deliver actionable advice and details about vulnerabilities affecting items in customers’ SBOMs to help ensure that they have a complete picture of the risk that an open source vulnerability may pose.

As shown in Figure 2, CWE-707 is the pillar for CWEs 20, 79, 80, 97, and 937. CWE-707 concerns security requirements that are not being met before data is read from an upstream component or sent to a downstream component. Failing to properly neutralize input can lead to exploits such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. A common and dangerous exploit, XSS is associated with the majority of the top 10 vulnerabilities highlighted in this report.

Cross-site scripting occurs when an attacker takes advantage of a flaw in a website by sending malicious, malformed code, usually written in JavaScript. Since this input isn’t properly neutralized or escaped, the exploit can manipulate the otherwise trustworthy host into performing malicious tasks. The end target of most XSS attacks isn’t the host itself, though; it’s other users of the web application. Once the malicious script is injected, it can be used to steal sensitive information, like session cookies.

Not only is XSS in our top 10 vulnerabilities list, it is also one of the vulnerabilities in the OWASP Top 10 list—a report that lists the 10 most critical web application security risks. In its list, OWASP refers to XSS as A03:2021 – Injection. The reason for the prevalence of XSS vulnerabilities can be credited to increased reliance on web-based applications as a way for organizations to interact with customers, and for users to interact with one another. For example, consider how many eCommerce companies, banks, internet service providers, insurance companies, and others offer web experiences to engage with their customers and partners.

Again, the data clearly shows that development teams need to improve at keeping open source components up-to-date, especially when it comes to popular open source components such as jQuery. The consequences of using older, more vulnerable versions of open source can be grim. For example, #2 of the top 10 vulnerabilities found in the audits is BDSA-2020-0686 (CVE-2020-11022), an XSS vulnerability in jQuery versions 1.2 to 3.5.0. This vulnerability enables passing HTML from untrusted sources—even after sanitizing it—to one of jQuery’s DOM manipulation methods, and may execute untrusted code. This issue was patched in jQuery 3.5.0, but as our data illustrates, a third of the codebases scanned for security risks were found to be using a jQuery version still vulnerable to it. Malicious data could be used to breach a system, or sensitive data—passwords, credit information—could be exposed. As noted earlier, cross-site scripting is one of the most common vulnerabilities in applications, classically using a code injection attack against the various language interpreters in the browser, such as HTML or JavaScript.

### Mitigating Risk: Tips for Using jQuery and Other Popular Open Source Securely

All 10 of the top 10 open source components identified in the audits were written in JavaScript. The bulk of vulnerabilities found in the audits were also associated with JavaScript libraries, notably vulnerabilities in outdated versions of the jQuery JavaScript library.

*   Use the latest version of jQuery. As shown in this report, older versions of jQuery often contain security vulnerabilities.
*   Consider subscribing to a security advisory service—such as Black Duck Security Advisories—to get the latest vulnerability information. New security vulnerabilities are discovered in jQuery regularly.
*   Use a secure coding framework to help you to identify and avoid potential security vulnerabilities in your code.
*   Use automated security testing—including static analysis, software composition analysis, and dynamic analysis tools—to address code quality and security flaws throughout the software development life cycle.

Eight of the top 10 vulnerabilities map to one pillar CWE, CWE-707, which addresses security requirements that are not being met, and can lead to exploits such as cross-site scripting and SQL injection.

jQuery is not inherently insecure. In fact, it is a well-maintained open source library with a large community of users, developers, and maintainers. But problems often accompany popularity. According to the audits, jQuery was the component most likely to have vulnerabilities, even though each of the jQuery vulnerabilities listed in this report have available patches. It is important for users of jQuery—and indeed users of all open source—to be aware of the potential security risks associated with older versions of software, and to take steps to mitigate those risks.

## Taking Action to Prevent Vulnerabilities from Entering Your Software Supply Chain

*   Create and maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). In the fight against software supply chain attacks, having an accurate, up-to-date SBOM that inventories open source components is critical to assessing exposure, and ensuring that your code remains high quality, compliant, and secure. A comprehensive SBOM lists all the open source components in your applications as well as those components’ licenses, versions, and patch status—a strong defense against supply chain attacks, including those using malicious packages.
*   Stay informed. Ensure that you have the means to be informed of newly identified malicious packages, malware, and disclosed open source vulnerabilities. Look for newsfeeds or regularly issued advisories that provide actionable advice and details about issues affecting open source components in your SBOM.
*   Perform code reviews. Examine the code of downloaded software before including it in your project. Check for any known vulnerabilities. For additional insight, consider including a static analysis of source code to check for unknown security weaknesses.
*   Be proactive. Just because a component isn’t vulnerable today doesn’t mean that it won’t be tomorrow. Intentionally malicious packages may never even be discovered as “vulnerable.” Pay attention to component health and provenance before implementation to avoid future security issues.
*   Use an automated software composition analysis (SCA) tool. An SCA tool automates the process of identification, management, and mitigation of software security issues and allows developers to focus their energies on writing code. Such tools can evaluate open source and third-party code.



A “pillar weakness” is defined by the CWE project as the highest-level weakness representing a base for all class/variant weaknesses related to it.

## Why Some BDSAs Don’t Have CVEs

Public sources, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), are a good first step for information on publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in open source software. But there can be lags in the reporting of any given NVD CVE entry. Timeliness has always been a factor affecting the ability of the NVD to publicize security vulnerability data. In fact, there is often a significant time lag between the first disclosure of a vulnerability and its publication in the NVD, with some research reporting a month on average between the initial announcement and NVD publication.

Another problem with the NVD is that it often provides incomplete vulnerability data. Many CVEs published in the NVD do not include vulnerable version ranges and are often too short to be useful. This is commonly because no resources were available to research the entry.

Clearly, it’s unwise to rely solely on the NVD for vulnerability information. Many commercial SCA solutions can provide richer vulnerability data than the NVD alone, in addition to finding issues more accurately and helping you fix them more quickly when warranted. For example, if you are using Black Duck, an SCA solution from Synopsys, you can take advantage of BDSAs, which are advisories of open source vulnerabilities identified by Synopsys security research teams. Often these advisories provide earlier notification of vulnerabilities affecting your codebase—it can be days or weeks before they appear in the NVD. BDSAs also provide more complete vulnerability data, delivering security insight, technical details, and upgrade/patch guidance beyond anything else commercially available today. For example, there are three BDSAs without associated CVEs from the NVD in our top 10 vulnerability listing for 2023.

### BDSA-2021-3651

According to the BDSA, some versions of jQuery contain commented references to a hijacked domain. It is a security issue of sorts, and the safest thing to do was remove the links to the hijacked domain, which is what jQuery did in version 3.6.1, because users without awareness of a domain’s status could still be exposed to unspecified attacks if they attempted to follow the links to the hijacked site. Although the sites cannot be reached by running the code, there is value in flagging the issue, as the malicious site could accidentally be clicked by a developer or anyone with access.

The Synopsys CyRC team advises that this BDSA is tagged as “informational,” a tag used when the “fix” provided by the vendor takes the form of a warning in the code or the product documentation, or when the vendor has rejected the CVE or disputed the findings, and deems the reported vulnerability as expected/designed behavior in the component.

### BDSA-2014-0063

This is an older vulnerability, first raised as an issue in January 2014 and relating to a potential XSS vulnerability in jQuery caused by a lack of user-supplied input validation. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts and steal a victim’s session cookies.

According to the BDSA, a function parses an HTML string into an array of DOM nodes. Any scripts included in event attributes passed to this function are immediately executed. This could leave a caller of the function vulnerable to XSS attacks if they do not properly sanitize untrusted input before it is passed to the function. An attacker could exploit this by crafting malicious HTML to be supplied to a victim. If processed, any web scripts included will be executed on their system.

This vulnerability was mitigated in jQuery 3.0.0-rc1. However, the mitigation does not sanitize malicious input and will still allow scripts to be executed. The default behavior of the parser is changed such that if the context is unspecified or given as null/undefined, a new document is created. This delays execution of parsed HTML until it is injected into the document, allowing the opportunity for tools to traverse the created DOM and remove unsafe content after the function call.
