## Foreword
I am pleased to present the 2023–24 Annual Cyber Threat Report.

This year’s report comes amid a continued deterioration in Australia’s strategic environment. The
Indo‑Pacific continues to face entrenched strategic competition, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has entered its
third year and conflict continues to unfold in the Middle East.

As the 2024 National Defence Strategy outlined, these challenges are being compounded by rapid
technological advancements. Malign actors – both state and non-state – are improving their cyber
capabilities, increasing the risk of disruptions to Australia’s critical systems, infrastructure and networks.
Grey-zone activities have also expanded in the Indo-Pacific, with malicious cyber actors continuing to
conduct espionage and spread disinformation.

This year’s report outlines the cyber threat posed to Australian governments, critical infrastructure,
businesses and households. It shows how malicious state actors and cybercriminals are continuing to
adapt their tradecraft in an attempt to compromise Australian networks.

These circumstances underline the significant role that cyber capabilities play in safeguarding our national
security and the critical role ASD continues to play in protecting Australians. That is why the Albanese
Government has committed $15–$20 billion to 2033–34 to enhance our cyber domain capabilities as part of
the 2024 Integrated Investment Program.

This significant investment will provide greater visibility of threats to critical infrastructure, increase the
resilience of our infrastructure to cyber attacks, provide new intelligence functions and enable offensive
cyber operations. The Government has also prioritised REDSPICE funding to enhance ASD’s signals
intelligence and cyber capabilities.

This report highlights the importance of strong partnerships between the public and private sectors in
defending Australians from cyber threats and making our country a harder target. It also reflects the
concrete steps we are taking to deter cybercriminals and hold them to account, with the Government
having used for the first time Australia’s autonomous cyber sanctions framework to impose cyber sanctions
on Russian cybercriminals.

Informed by ASD’s intelligence insights and partnerships, this report reinforces the importance of enhancing
our nation’s cyber defences and the need for all Australians to play their part in protecting our collective
cyber security. Reporting cybercrime, incidents and vulnerabilities remains a critical part of building a
national threat picture and enabling us to effectively counter malicious cyber actors.

This report is a key part of the Government’s efforts to raise the profile of Australia’s cyber threats to ensure
we can respond effectively to keep Australians safe.

The Hon Richard Marles MP
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence

## Executive summary
Australia faces the most complex and challenging strategic environment since the Second World War. These
strategic challenges extend to the cyber threat landscape. While advancements in critical and emerging
technologies offer significant social and economic benefits, they also improve the capabilities of malicious
cyber actors who continue to target Australia’s networks.

In FY2023–24, ASD received over 36,700 calls to its Australian Cyber Security Hotline, an increase of 12%
from the previous financial year. ASD also responded to over 1,100 cyber security incidents, highlighting the
continued exploitation of Australian systems and ongoing threat to our critical networks.

State-sponsored cyber actors persistently target Australian governments, critical infrastructure and
businesses using evolving tradecraft. These actors conduct cyber operations in pursuit of state goals,
including for espionage, in exerting malign influence, interference and coercion, and in seeking to pre-position
on networks for disruptive cyber attacks.

Over the past year, ASD co-sealed several joint advisories with international partners to highlight the
evolving operations of state-sponsored cyber actors. In February 2024, ASD joined the US and other
international partners in releasing an advisory that assessed the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is
leveraging living off the land techniques that abuse native tools and processes on systems. The PRC’s choice
of targets and pattern of behaviour is consistent with pre-positioning for disruptive effects rather than
traditional cyber espionage operations.

Russia is also adapting its techniques, including for the exploitation of cloud platforms. The evolution of
this tradecraft means that network defenders must prioritise and invest in cyber security skills, resources
and teams.

Critical infrastructure networks are an attractive target due to the sensitive data they hold and the
widespread disruption that a cyber security incident can cause on those networks. In FY2023–24, over 11% of
cyber security incidents ASD responded to related to critical infrastructure. Compromise could lead to the
disruption of critical services, affecting the economy and lives of everyday Australians.

Cybercrime is a persistent and disruptive threat. Cybercriminals are adapting to capitalise on new
opportunities, such as artificial intelligence, which reduces the level of sophistication needed for cybercriminals
to operate. In FY2023–24, business email compromise and fraud were among the top self-reported
cybercrimes for businesses and individuals in Australia. Ransomware and data theft extortion also remained a
pervasive and costly threat.

In response to this threat, ASD has worked across government, with industry and international partners
to successfully pursue cybercriminals targeting Australia. During FY2023–24, the Australian Government
for the first time used Australia’s autonomous cyber sanctions framework to sanction two Russian
citizens for their roles in cybercrime activities. These sanctions are a key tool in deterring cybercrime and
protecting Australians.

Strong partnerships are critical to building cyber resilience and making Australia a harder target. ASD
continues to monitor and adapt to the threat environment, and collaborates on a national scale to protect
Australians. An increasing number of industry and government partners are choosing to participate in
ASD programs, which provide a platform to share threat intelligence and expertise. This includes the ASD-
Microsoft initiative to connect ASD’s Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing platform with Microsoft’s Sentinel
platform. These types of collaborations are improving the speed and scale of information-sharing between
and among government agencies and industry partners.

In FY2023–24, ASD notified entities more than 930 times of potential malicious activity on their networks. A
robust partnership between government and industry underpins our ability to effectively defend the nation
against malicious cyber activity.

Cyber security is not set-and-forget. Organisations should consider replacing unsupported information and
communications technology (ICT) systems with secure-by-design products, consider cyber security when
implementing new technologies and follow ASD’s best-practice cyber security advice, such as the Essential
Eight. Regularly updating and applying ICT best practice builds resilience now and into the future.

Be ready to respond. Critical infrastructure organisations should adopt a stance of ‘when’ not ‘if’ a cyber
security incident will occur. All organisations should have a cyber security incident response plan and test it
regularly to ensure an effective response and fast recovery. To develop and implement a response plan, an
organisation needs to know its systems and where its most valuable data is stored.

ASD encourages every organisation and individual who observes suspicious cyber activity, incidents and
vulnerabilities to report to ReportCyber at cyber.gov.au, and to the Australian Cyber Security Hotline 1300
CYBER1 (1300 292 371). ASD provides free technical incident response advice and assistance, 24 hours a day,
7 days a week.

### Cyber security incidents by severity category
*Image description: A bar chart showing the number of cyber security incidents by severity category for FY2023-24. The chart is broken down by the severity of the incident, from C1 (most severe) to C6 (least severe), and the type of organisation affected. The chart shows that the most common type of incident was an unsuccessful low-level malicious attack, with 360 incidents affecting members of the public, 70 affecting small organisations, 20 affecting sole traders, 13 affecting medium-sized organisations, and 13 affecting schools. The next most common type of incident was a low-level malicious attack, with 81 incidents affecting members of the public, 53 affecting small organisations, 60 affecting sole traders, 95 affecting medium-sized organisations, 11 affecting schools, and 3 affecting local government. The third most common type of incident was an isolated compromise, with 57 incidents affecting members of the public, 93 affecting small organisations, 75 affecting sole traders, 46 affecting medium-sized organisations, and 1 affecting schools. The chart also shows that there were 6 extensive compromises, 20 coordinated low-level malicious attacks, and 1 sustained disruption of essential systems and associated services.*

ASD categorises each cyber security incident it responds to on a scale of Category 1 (C1), the most severe,
to Category 6 (C6), the least severe. Cyber security incidents are categorised on severity of impact and
significance of the organisation’s impact to Australia.

In FY2023–24, there was a slight decrease in the number of extensive compromises, while the number of
unsuccessful low-level malicious attacks increased by 10% compared with FY2022–23. There was also a 39%
increase in isolated compromises this financial year.

Coordinated low-level malicious cyber attacks fell by 77%, however this largely reflects a spike in incidents
in FY2022–23 following a specific hacktivist campaign. It does not necessarily imply that the threat of
coordinated low-level malicious cyber activity has diminished.

Incidents categorised as C3 or above involve organisations such as federal and state governments,
large organisations, academia, and supply chains. The frequency of C3 or above incidents in FY2023–24
was consistent with FY2022–23, with 14% of all incidents being categorised C3 or above. While ASD
only responded to one C2 incident, down from 5 in FY2022–23, the nature of the incident highlights the
importance of ensuring systems are updated – the C2 was through the exploitation of a known vulnerability
targeting a legacy, unpatched test server.

Over a quarter (26%) of all C3 incidents were discovered as a result of a tipper, where ASD proactively
notified the affected organisation of suspicious activity. The most common malicious activity leading to 30%
of C3 incidents was the exploitation of public facing applications.

C3 incidents commonly involved compromised accounts or credentials (23%), malware infection other
than ransomware (19%) and compromised assets, networks or infrastructure (18%). This contrasts with C3
incidents in FY2022–23, where assets, networks or infrastructure were more frequently compromised than
accounts or credentials. This suggests that malicious actors will adapt their methods to gain access.

### Cyber security incidents by month
*Image description: A line graph showing the number of cyber security incidents by month for FY2023-24. The graph shows that the number of incidents was relatively consistent throughout the year, with a slight peak in March and a slight dip in January. The number of incidents ranged from a low of 70 in January to a high of 111 in March.*

ASD responded to over 1,100 cyber security incidents, around the
same as in the last financial year.

### Top 10 reporting sectors
*Image description: A pie chart showing the top 10 reporting sectors for cyber security incidents in FY2023-24. The chart shows that the public safety and administration division was the most frequently reported sector, accounting for 37% of all incidents. The next most frequently reported sectors were retail trade (12%), transport, postal and warehousing (6%), financial and insurance services (5%), information media and telecommunications (5%), electricity, gas, water and waste water services (5%), professional, scientific and technical services (5%), educational and training (4%), healthcare and social assistance (4%), and state and local government (3%).*

The top 5 reporting
sectors are consistent
with FY2022–23.

ASD categorises sectors following
the Australian and New Zealand
Standard Industrial Classification
Divisions from the Australian
Bureau of Statistics. The public
safety and administration
division encompasses several
sectors, including federal, state,
territory and local governments,
public order and safety services,
and defence.

Compared to FY2022–23, healthcare and social assistance rose to be the most frequently reported
non-government sector.

Government sectors and regulated critical infrastructure have additional reporting obligations, which may
explain the relatively high reporting rate for these sectors compared with others.

*   The number of extortion-related cyber security incidents responded to by ASD increased by 9%
    compared to the last financial year.
    *   Around 71% of these incidents involved ransomware.
*   In FY2023–24, ASD responded to 53 incidents involving Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of
    Service (DDoS) attacks, a decrease of 15% on the last financial year.

### Most common reported threats and key steps to improving cyber security
*Image description: A table outlining the most common reported threats and key steps to improving cyber security. The table is broken down into three sections: Top 3 reported cyber security incident types for critical infrastructure, Top 3 reported cyber security incident types for government (federal, state and local), and Top 3 self-reported cybercrime threats for business (S,M,L), and Top 3 self-reported cybercrime threats for individuals. Each section lists the top three threats, along with mitigation strategies for each threat.*

## State actors
*   The threat of state-sponsored cyber operations is persistent and will likely grow as strategic
    competition in the Indo-Pacific increases.
*   State-sponsored cyber actors will continue targeting Australian governments, critical infrastructure,
    and businesses, as well as connected systems and their supply chains, for espionage and
    information-gathering purposes. These actors will continue to adapt their techniques, using both
    publicly available and bespoke tools to achieve their objectives.
*   In February 2024, ASD joined other Five Eyes partners in a US-led advisory, which assessed that the
    People’s Republic of China state-sponsored cyber actors are seeking to pre-position themselves
    on information and communications technology networks for disruptive cyber attacks against
    US critical infrastructure in the event of a major crisis or conflict. Australian critical infrastructure
    networks could be vulnerable to similar state-sponsored malicious cyber activity as seen in the US.
*   ASD’s Cyber Security Partnership Program and the Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing platform
    support Australian organisations to combat state-based cyber threats.

### Global state-sponsored cyber activity increases as tensions rise
Australia continues to face a complex set of strategic circumstances. Multiple ongoing conflicts are
fueling international instability and increasing strategic competition between the US and China is a
primary feature of our security environment.

**Explainer 1: Australia’s strategic environment**
The 2024 National Defence Strategy highlights that Australia faces its most complex and challenging
strategic environment since the Second World War. Entrenched and increasing strategic competition is
being accompanied by an unprecedented conventional and non-conventional military build-up in our
region, without strategic reassurance or transparency. Grey-zone activities have also expanded in the
lndo-Pacific and are facilitated by technological developments, including in cyber capabilities. Threats
posed by state and non-state actors in the cyber domain are multiplying.

State-sponsored cyber operations continue to play a significant role in this strategic environment.
State‑sponsored cyber actors gather intelligence, exert malign influence, interference and coercion,
and seek to pre-position on critical networks. In the event of a major deterioration in the strategic
environment, Australia could be the target of significant disruptive cyber activities.

### Cyber attacks in modern conflict
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict both offer contemporary examples of how cyber
operations can support military and strategic objectives in conflict.

Since the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, cyber attacks have been used to cause disruptive and
destructive effects to both military and civilian infrastructure, including on telecommunications organisations,
postal and energy systems, and governments. These attacks have resulted in mobile and fixed-line
communications outages and blackouts that have impacted military operations and civilian populations.

Conflict can also give rise to politically-motivated cyber activity. During the Israel–Hamas conflict, patriotic
hacking – a type of politically-motivated cyber activity – has been reported on both sides of the conflict,
with varying degrees of severity. This includes critical infrastructure targeting, digital billboard and website
defacement, and Distributed Denial of Service attacks.

### The threat of state-sponsored cyber operations in Australia
State-sponsored cyber actors will continue targeting Australian governments, critical infrastructure
and businesses.

Australian networks – particularly those connected to critical infrastructure systems either directly or
through their supply chains – may be targeted in order to pre-position capabilities for disruptive effects, or
may be used to access a higher-value target network.

State-sponsored cyber actors also have information-gathering and espionage objectives in Australia. State
actors have an enduring interest in obtaining sensitive information, intellectual property and personally
identifiable information to gain strategic and tactical advantage. Australian organisations often hold large
quantities of data, so are likely a target for this type of activity.

State-sponsored cyber actors often use previously stolen data, including from previous Australian cyber
security incidents (such as network information and credentials) to further their operations and re-exploit
network devices. While state-sponsored cyber actors’ intentions for the data they collect may differ from
cybercriminals, the way in which they compromise systems and extract data is aligned in their use of similar
techniques and weaknesses in systems.

### Tools and techniques of state-sponsored cyber actors
State-sponsored cyber actors use various tools and techniques to avoid detection and achieve their
objectives. These tools can be advanced and bespoke. However, they also use common, simple tools and
techniques to prevent the discovery of their best cyber capabilities.

**Case study 1: Simple techniques can be effective for state aims**
In December 2023, ASD and international partners released an advisory detailing a global spear phishing
campaign conducted by a Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) actor, Star Blizzard. The FSB-sponsored
group targeted a number of sectors – including defence, government, academia, and think tanks – around
the world.

Spear phishing is an effective but simple technique used by many different cyber actors. The advisory
highlights that techniques do not need to be advanced for state actors to achieve their goals.

The advisory, *Russian FSB cyber actor Star Blizzard continues worldwide spear phishing campaigns*, is available
at cyber.gov.au.

### Supply chain compromises
State-sponsored cyber actors can compromise target networks via their supply chains. The Australian
Government has previously attributed supply chain targeting to state-sponsored cyber actors, including
Russian actors that targeted US software firm SolarWinds.

Cyber supply chain risk management should form a significant component of an organisation’s overall
cyber security strategy. An effective strategy includes consideration of the product or service’s design,
manufacture, delivery, maintenance, decommissioning, and disposal. On 22 May, 2024 ASD released
updated advice on how to manage supply chain risks, available on cyber.gov.au.

### Living off the land techniques
State-sponsored cyber actors use built-in network administration tools to carry out their objectives and
evade detection by blending in with normal system and network activities, enabling them to decide when
to steal information or cause harm to an organisation’s network at a time of their own choosing. This is
known as living off the land (LOTL).

In February 2024, ASD joined the US and other international partners in releasing an advisory, *PRC
state-sponsored actors compromise and maintain persistent access to US critical infrastructure*. The
US assessed that PRC state-sponsored cyber actors had compromised and maintained access
to US critical infrastructure networks for disruptive cyber attacks in the event of a major crisis or
conflict. US agencies also assessed with high confidence that PRC state-sponsored cyber actor Volt
Typhoon, was pre-positioning itself on information and communications technology (ICT) networks
to enable lateral movement to operational technology (OT) assets to disrupt functions. In the
advisory, ASD assessed Australian critical infrastructure could be vulnerable to similar activity from
these actors.

Also in February 2024, ASD and international partners released an advisory, *Identifying and
Mitigating Living Off the Land Techniques*, which outlines techniques being deployed by the PRC and
Russia to compromise and maintain access to critical infrastructure systems.

In March 2024, ASD and international partners released a fact sheet, *PRC State-Sponsored
Cyber Activity: Actions for Critical Infrastructure Leaders*, detailing Volt Typhoon’s activities and
providing defensive actions for critical infrastructure organisations. The fact sheet made several
recommendations, including making informed and proactive resourcing decisions, securing supply
chains, and driving a cyber security culture within organisations.

These advisories and fact sheets highlight the threat posed by malicious cyber actors using LOTL
techniques to avoid detection and, importantly, the ways in which good cyber security can mitigate the
LOTL threat. LOTL tradecraft requires network defenders to think like the malicious cyber actor, by studying
abnormalities in behaviours occurring on systems rather than through traditional means such as intrusion
detection systems. *Best Practices for Event Logging and Threat Detection* at cyber.gov.au builds on existing
