## Executive Overview: Cyber Threats at a Glance

**Data Breaches Rose 34.5% in 2023.**

Flashpoint recorded 6,077 data breach incidents in 2023. More than 70% of these stolen records—which include everything from financial data to personal health records—stemmed from direct compromise or via an affected third-party.

**17Bn Records Stolen in 2023.**

From January 1 to February 29, 2024, the number of stolen or leaked personal data spiked more than 4X compared to the same period last year. Unauthorized access and ransomware remain the primary culprits behind data breaches, accounting for over half of the incidents impacting major industries.

**35% of Vulnerabilities in 2023 Had Known Public Exploits.**

Prioritization continues to be challenging as the number of new technologies is introduced into the market, with 2023 marking a significant peak of 33,137 issues. Of those issues, 35% had known public exploits. Moving into 2024, Flashpoint continues to observe similar trends in vulnerability totals, disclosure rates, and exploitability.

**Ransomware Attacks Rose by 84% in 2023.**

After leveraging both zero-day and disclosed vulnerabilities to gain illegal access, financially motivated threat actors take additional actions on objectives, like installing ransomware. Flashpoint identified a significant increase in ransomware attacks across all sectors in 2023, resulting in an increase of 84% YoY. In the first two months of 2024 alone, the number of public ransomware attacks has grown nearly 23% compared to the same period in 2023.

## Key Threat Landscapes: Data and Insights

### Data Breaches

Flashpoint breach data and intelligence, as detailed in this section, comprises the Deep and Dark Web and open sources, including public attorney general reports, ransomware blogs, and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Data is current to the date of publishing.

Flashpoint observed a significant uptick in data breach activity in 2023, with our analysts recording 6,077 publicly reported data breaches—a 34.5% increase compared to 2022. Data breaches are responsible for leaking over 17 billion personal records that included sensitive information such as names, social security numbers, and financial data. Over 70% of these incidents were the result of unauthorized access that stemmed from outside the affected organization.

The United States represented more than 60% of the global data breach total, reporting 3,804 data breaches—a 19.8% increase compared to 2022. In the first two months of 2024 alone, data breaches have increased by an additional 30% compared to the previous year, within the same period.

*   **Data Breaches 2023-24**
    *   A line graph shows the number of known incidents from January 2023 to February 2024, with a significant increase in early 2024.
*   **Number of Known Incidents**
    *   A pie chart shows the breakdown of causes for data breaches, with unauthorized access being the largest at 72.1%. Other causes include: Unknown (8.8%), Virus (3.9%), Misconfiguration (3.8%), Social Engineering (3.0%), Skimming (2.8%), Email (2.3%), Other (3.3%).
*   **19.8%** 2023 vs. 2022
*   **30%** Jan-Feb vs. PP
*   **60%** of Global data breaches
*   **3,804** Data breaches

However, of all incidents recorded last year, one cyberattack in particular had a profound impact on the data breach landscape—Cl0p’s exploitation of a vulnerability within the MOVEit file transfer application. By leveraging a vulnerability within the MOVEit Transfer file application (VulnDB ID: 322555, CVE 2023-34362), the ransomware group had compromised numerous organizations by the end of 2023, either directly or through third-party compromise. Looking specifically at public breach disclosures, Flashpoint analysts determined that the MOVEit attack was responsible for 19.3% of all reported 2023 data breaches. This figure includes affected third-parties, organizations who were not directly compromised by Cl0p, but had sensitive data stolen from vendors within their supply chain.

**Unauthorized Access Is Up In 2024.**

As we move forward into 2024, the data breach landscape is seeing a significant spike in stolen or leaked personal data. From January 1 - February 29, 2024, threat actors compromised 1.897 billion personal records and credentials—a 429% increase compared to the same period last year. Five data breach incidents have had an outsized impact:

| CVSS (v2 | v3) | Social Risk Score | Location              | Exploit        | Ransomware Likelihood |
| :---------- | :---------------- | :-------------------- | :------------- | :-------------------- |
| 7.5 | 9.8    | Low               | Remote / Network Access | Exploit Public | Critical              |

### The Effect of Ransomware and Unauthorized Access on Key Industries

To gain context into potential risks, organizations need to be aware of how the data breach landscape specifically affects their industry. How are threat actors gaining access into systems? Understanding the answer to this question is critical to forming safeguards and response plans.

**Ransomware and Unauthorized Access Are the Top Two Causes of Data Breaches in 2023.**

Together, they are responsible for more than half of all incidents experienced by major sectors. However, for the manufacturing and technology industries, ransomware and unauthorized access accounted for more than 85% of all publicly disclosed breach incidents. This data further illustrates the need for robust threat intelligence and vulnerability management programs that can help reduce risk, prevent losses, and maintain day-to-day operations.

| Industry             | Number of breaches | Total data stolen | Percentage of overall breaches caused by unauthorized access and ransomware |
| :------------------- | :----------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manufacturing        | 754                | 6M                | 86.2%                                                                    |
| Healthcare           | 735                | 92M               | 65.3%                                                                    |
| Government           | 582                | 1.3Bn             | 54.1%                                                                    |
| Financial            | 530                | 375M              | 52.6%                                                                    |

### Vulnerabilities

The data in this section comprises Flashpoint’s vulnerability intelligence, covering all attack surfaces—including vendors, endpoints, cloud, Internet of things (IoT), operational technology, open source software (OSS), and third-party libraries and dependencies. Flashpoint’s vulnerability enrichment provides full context into metadata such as EPSS, exploit intelligence, social risk, and ransomware likelihood. Data is current to the date of publishing.

From a threat actor’s perspective, unpatched vulnerabilities are opportunities to gain access into an organization. By exploiting them, vulnerabilities allow malicious actors to spread through compromised networks—allowing them to perform a wide variety of actions that may ultimately result in data loss or exposure. However, due to the increasing disclosure of vulnerabilities from an expanded digital ecosystem, organizations may be unaware of vulnerabilities within their networks. One major blind spot occurs when enterprises strictly rely on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) database, which is missing over 100,000 vulnerabilities—nearly a third of known vulnerability risk.

Flashpoint vulnerability intelligence shows that disclosed vulnerabilities have displayed a consistent upward trend, with 2023 marking a significant peak at 33,137 disclosures. This progressive increase underscores the escalating challenge for cybersecurity defenses, as it is unfeasible for any organization, regardless of maturity, to triage and remediate all of these issues in a timely manner.

The efficient identification, prioritization, and remediation of vulnerabilities are crucial in preventing or mitigating the impact of breaches and cyber attacks. However, security teams will continue to face challenges as the total number of vulnerabilities increases and new issues are disclosed at a consistent rate. Throughout 2023, the distribution of vulnerabilities per month has seen little fluctuation, with the number of vulnerabilities being disclosed ranging from 2,425 to 3,111. Moving into 2024, Flashpoint is observing similar disclosure totals.

*   **Vulnerability Disclosures Reported by Year, 2014-23**
    *   A line graph shows the number of vulnerabilities and public exploits from 2014 to 2023, with a significant increase in 2023.
*   **Vulnerability Disclosures Reported by Month, 2023-24**
    *   A line graph shows the number of vulnerabilities and public exploits from January 2023 to February 2024.

Further examining the rate of vulnerability disclosures, looking at the top 10 days in 2023 with the most reported vulnerabilities, there is a consistent trend: they all take place on the second Tuesday of each month. This is no coincidence as Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday has always played a major role in every year’s rising totals. As more vendors adopt Microsoft’s monthly disclosure schedule, organizations will need a timely and actionable source of vulnerability intelligence to help reduce the need for lengthy manual research.

**Severity’s effect on prioritization**

Flashpoint vulnerability intelligence shows that nearly 52% of all vulnerabilities disclosed in 2023 are scored high to critical (7.0 to 10.0) in severity, according to CVSSv3. For most organizations, vulnerabilities scored between 7.0 to 10.0 are considered to be a major risk, but if more than half of the year’s total meet this criteria, which ones should be prioritized? Remediation is a timely process, and if vulnerability management teams are expected to triage all of these issues, it is highly possible that many of these issues will go unpatched.

Organizations should also be aware that the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) no longer provides base scores for CVSSv2, and has instead opted to score using CVSSv3. This is significant for three reasons.

*   Many organizations still currently choose to rely on CVSSv2 for prioritization.
*   Due to differences in scoring methodologies, a vulnerability scored in CVSSv2 can vary greatly from CVSSv3, which can have a major impact on prioritization.
*   CVSSv4 was released in November 2023.

*   **Breakdown of Vulnerabilities Disclosed in 2023, CVSSv2 vs CVSSv3**
    *   A bar graph shows the number of vulnerabilities in low, medium, high, and critical categories for both CVSSv2 and CVSSv3.
*   **Top Ten Days in 2023 With the Most Vulnerability Disclosures**
    *   A table lists the top ten days in 2023 with the most vulnerability disclosures, all of which fall on the second Tuesday of the month.

| Date    | Vulnerabilities Disclosed |
| :------ | :----------------------- |
| NOV 11  | 455                      |
| DEC 12  | 442                      |
| AUG 8   | 441                      |
| FEB 14  | 416                      |
| MAR 13  | 347                      |
| APR 11  | 333                      |
| JUL 11  | 326                      |
| OCT 10  | 307                      |
| MAY 9   | 302                      |
| JUN 13  | 275                      |

Flashpoint has found that categorizing high severity vulnerabilities based on the following criteria can have massive benefits for vulnerability management teams:

*   Remotely exploitable
*   Known public exploit
*   Known solution details

Adopting this model can allow vulnerability management teams to cut their critical workloads by nearly 85%.

By shifting immediate attention to issues that are remotely exploitable that have public exploits, with known solution information, organizations can maximize their resources. Once those issues are fully triaged and taken care of, they can then focus on less severe issues.

| Category             | Count |
| :------------------- | :---- |
| Remotely exploitable | 8,750 |
| Known public exploit | 7,708 |
| Known solution details | 4,613 |
| Remotely exploitable & Known public exploit | 1,093 |
| Remotely exploitable & Known solution details | 3,776 |
| Known public exploit & Known solution details | 2,442 |

### Beyond CVE: Uncovering the Hidden Vulnerability Landscape

Organizations strictly relying on CVE are likely unaware of nearly a third of known vulnerability risk. Flashpoint has documented over 100,000 vulnerabilities that CVE has failed to report, many of which affect major vendors such as Google and Microsoft. Flashpoint’s non-CVE coverage has also identified a significant number of issues affecting numerous third-party libraries—in addition to zero-day and in-the-wild exploits that are being used by threat actors.

As of February 2024, Flashpoint analysts have cataloged 330 vulnerabilities that were discovered being exploited in the wild, that still do not have a CVE ID. These include vulnerabilities in:

*   Adobe Reader
*   Apple iOS
*   Apple macOS
*   Google Android
*   Microsoft SQL Server
*   Siemens SIMATIC
*   Solarwinds Orion Platform

As of February 2024, the following have been exploited in some form of malware, yet do not have a CVE ID:

*   Apache Hadoop
*   Google Authenticator for Android
*   PHP

Any vulnerability management team that feels underserved by their current coverage needs visibility into non-CVE issues—especially if they are leveraging legacy or end-of-life software. Having immediate access to actionable data empowers security teams to address issues, sometimes as fast as two weeks compared to CVE.

*   A graphic shows a list of vendors: SAP AG, Google, Zoho Corp, Maria DB Foundation, FFmpeg Project, IBM Corporation, The Apache Software Foundation, Oracle Corporation, Libav.org, Microsoft Corporation, and a number 100,000.

### Ransomware

The data in this section comprises victimized organizations that have been announced on ransomware blogs and leak sites. Data is current to the date of publishing.

Ransomware plays a massive role within the threat intelligence landscape. Flashpoint identified a significant escalation in ransomware attacks across all sectors in 2023, with the total rising to 5,028 attacks—an 84% YoY increase (2,720).

LockBit was the most prolific ransomware group of the year, claiming 1,049 victims—over one fifth of all known ransomware attacks in 2023. The group has gained notoriety for its sophisticated and ruthless strain of ransomware. Recent analysis of a possible LockBit 4.0 variant noted functionality that includes randomizing the victims’ file naming to complicate restoration efforts, a self-delete mechanism that overwrites LockBit’s own file contents with null bytes, and the ability to delete victims’ shadow copies and backups to inhibit recovery. Coupled with their harsh negotiation practices, including the use of a triple extortion method, victims of LockBit are often left to grapple with difficult decisions.

| Snatch           | 61                    |

On February 20, 2024, US authorities, in collaboration with the UK’s National Crime Agency and additional international allies, announced the disruption of the LockBit ransomware group as part of a concerted initiative known as “Operation Cronos.”

Despite the success of Operation Cronos, the LockBit ransomware collective has persisted. They quickly established a new Dark Web blog, alleging that law enforcement only managed to seize control of a segment of their operations. According to its new site, they have resumed their ransomware operations, though these assertions have not been confirmed as of this publishing. Even with LockBit’s continued activities post-disruption, indications are suggesting that Operation Cronos has had a more significant impact on their operations than they are willing to admit.



                                   the most active groups in 2024.

Nevertheless, as of this publishing, LockBit remains the most prolific ransomware group in 2024, documenting 154 public victim announcements on their leak site within the first two months alone—almost triple the number of the second most active groups (8Base, BlackCat). There’s a possibility that the group could recover. However, even if they don’t, numerous other cybercriminal factions are poised to take their place, indicating that the fight against cybercrime is expected to persist indefinitely.

So far in 2024, the frequency and severity of ransomware attacks on organizations have increased, with 637 public ransomware attacks in the first two months, up from 518 in the same period of 2023. To mitigate this rising threat, it’s crucial for organizations to develop and implement robust prevention and response strategies proactively.
