2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report2Foreword: 
On Resilience and Security in 2024 

In the evolving landscape of global security, where cyber and physical threats increasingly converge, the Flashpoint 

2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report offers a critical examination of the current threat environment. This year’s 

analysis goes beyond traditional threat intelligence, incorporating Flashpoint’s unparalleled data and insights to shed light 

on cyber threats, geopolitical turmoil, and escalating physical conflicts around the world. The goal: help your organization 

to strengthen its defenses, ensure operational resilience, and proactively confront multifaceted threats—thereby 

safeguarding critical assets, preventing financial losses, and protecting lives.

Cyber threats remain at the forefront of global security challenges, as opportunistic and resilient adversaries exploit 

vulnerabilities through sophisticated tactics. Our annual report details the continuing surge of ransomware attacks, data 

breach trends, and the exploitation of vulnerabilities, underscoring the evolving nature of cyber risks. Sectors rich in 

sensitive and confidential data continue to be prime targets, emphasizing the critical need for robust cybersecurity 

measures and actionable intelligence to counter threats and protect assets. 

Looking ahead through 2024, we see the ongoing convergence of cyber and physical threats exacerbated by 

escalating geopolitical unrest. These include crucial elections, the continuous conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the 

Israel\-Hamas War, and strategic tensions in the Taiwan Strait, each adding layers of complexity to the global threat 

landscape.

A notable highlight of our annual report is its focus on the central role of open\-source intelligence (OSINT) in addressing 

not only cyber threats but also physical security challenges. In these pages, Flashpoint Executive Director of Global 

Security, Andrew Borene, provides his perspective on the next evolution of OSINT. The importance of OSINT is further 

detailed through a case study about its role in an investigation of fentanyl precursor sales. This investigation reveals the 

complex networks behind illicit activities, showcasing the effectiveness of integrated intelligence in dismantling such 

operations to enhance public safety and national security. 

I invite you to explore the insights provided in the report and to utilize it as a 

cornerstone for constructing a more resilient and secure future. As we navigate this 

complex landscape, reinforcing our defenses against threats that seek to compromise 

our collective security, the Flashpoint 2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report 

illuminates the path forward, offering a beacon of clarity in a sea of uncertainty.

Executive Overview: 
Cyber Threats at a Glance 

6,077

Data Breaches

Data Breaches Rose 34\.5% in 2023\. 

Flashpoint recorded 6,077 data breach incidents in 2023\. More than 70% of these stolen 

records—which include everything from financial data to personal health records—stemmed 

from direct compromise or via an affected third\-party. 

17Bn Records Stolen in 2023\. 

From January 1 to February 29, 2024, the number of stolen or leaked personal data spiked 

more than 4X compared to the same period last year. Unauthorized access and ransomware 

remain the primary culprits behind data breaches, accounting for over half of the incidents 

impacting major industries.

Prioritization continues to be challenging as the number of new technologies is introduced 

into the market, with 2023 marking a significant peak of 33,137 issues. Of those issues, 35% 

had known public exploits. Moving into 2024, Flashpoint continues to observe similar trends 

in vulnerability totals, disclosure rates, and exploitability. 

Ransomware Attacks Rose by 84% in 2023\. 

After leveraging both zero\-day and disclosed vulnerabilities to gain illegal access, 

financially motivated threat actors take additional actions on objectives, like installing 

ransomware. Flashpoint identified a significant increase in ransomware attacks across 

all sectors in 2023, resulting in an increase of 84% YoY. In the first two months of 2024 

alone, the number of public ransomware attacks has grown nearly 23% compared to the 

same period in 2023\.

Flashpoint observed a significant uptick in 

data breach activity in 2023, with our analysts 

recording 6,077 publicly reported data 

breaches—a 34\.5% increase compared to 

2022\. Data breaches are responsible for 

leaking over 17 billion personal records that 

included sensitive information such as names, 

social security numbers, and financial data. 

Over 70% of these incidents were the result 

of unauthorized access that stemmed from

The Effect of Ransomware and 
Unauthorized Access on Key Industries 

To gain context into potential risks, organizations need to be aware of how the data breach landscape specifically affects 

their industry. How are threat actors gaining access into systems? Understanding the answer to this question is critical to 

forming safeguards and response plans.

Ransomware and Unauthorized Access Are 
the Top Two Causes of Data Breaches in 2023\. 

Together, they are responsible for more than half of all incidents experienced by major sectors. However, for the 

manufacturing and technology industries, ransomware and unauthorized access accounted for more than 85% of all 

publicly disclosed breach incidents. This data further illustrates the need for robust threat intelligence and vulnerability 

management programs that can help reduce risk, prevent losses, and maintain day\-to\-day operations.

Vulnerabilities

The data in this section comprises Flashpoint’s vulnerability intelligence, covering all attack surfaces—including 

vendors, endpoints, cloud, Internet of things (IoT), operational technology, open source software (OSS), and third\-party 

libraries and dependencies. Flashpoint’s vulnerability enrichment provides full context into metadata such as EPSS, 

exploit intelligence, social risk, and ransomware likelihood. Data is current to the date of publishing.

From a threat actor’s perspective, unpatched vulnerabilities are opportunities to gain access into an organization. By 

exploiting them, vulnerabilities allow malicious actors to spread through compromised networks—allowing them to 

perform a wide variety of actions that may ultimately result in data loss or exposure. However, due to the increasing 

disclosure of vulnerabilities from an expanded digital ecosystem, organizations may be unaware of vulnerabilities within 

their networks. One major blind spot occurs when enterprises strictly rely on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure 

(CVE) database, which is missing over 100,000 vulnerabilities—nearly a third of known vulnerability risk. 

Flashpoint vulnerability intelligence shows that 

disclosed vulnerabilities have displayed a 

consistent upward trend, with 2023 marking a 

significant peak at 33,137 disclosures. This 

progressive increase underscores the 

escalating challenge for cybersecurity defenses, 

as it is unfeasible for any organization, regardless 

of maturity, to triage and remediate all of these 

issues in a timely manner.

The efficient identification, prioritization, and 

remediation of vulnerabilities are crucial in 

preventing or mitigating the impact of 

breaches and cyber attacks. However, security 

teams will continue to face challenges as the 

total number of vulnerabilities increases and 

new issues are disclosed at a consistent rate. 

Throughout 2023, the distribution of 

vulnerabilities per month has seen little 

fluctuation, with the number of vulnerabilities 

being disclosed ranging from 2,425 to 3,111\.

Further examining the rate of vulnerability disclosures, looking at the top 10 days in 2023 with the most reported 

vulnerabilities, there is a consistent trend: they all take place on the second Tuesday of each month. This is no 

coincidence as Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday has always played a major role in every year’s rising totals. As more vendors 

adopt Microsoft’s monthly disclosure schedule, organizations will need a timely and actionable source of vulnerability 

intelligence to help reduce the need for lengthy manual research. 

Severity’s effect on prioritization 

Flashpoint vulnerability intelligence shows that nearly 52% of all vulnerabilities disclosed in 2023 are scored high to 

critical (7\.0 to 10\.0\) in severity, according to CVSSv3\. For most organizations, vulnerabilities scored between 7\.0 to 10\.0 

are considered to be a major risk, but if more than half of the year’s total meet this criteria, which ones should be 

prioritized? Remediation is a timely process, and if vulnerability management teams are expected to triage all of these 

issues, it is highly possible that many of these issues will go unpatched. 

Breakdown of Vulnerabilities Disclosed
in 2023, CVSSv2 vs CVSSv3

Organizations should also be aware that the National Vulner\-

ability Database (NVD) no longer provides base scores for 

CVSSv2, and has instead opted to score using CVSSv3\. This is

• Many organizations still currently choose to rely on CVSSv2 

for prioritization.

• Due to differences in scoring methodologies, a vulnerability 

scored in CVSSv2 can vary greatly from CVSSv3, which can 

have a major impact on prioritization.

• CVSSv4 was released in November 2023\.

By shifting immediate attention to issues that are remotely exploitable that have public exploits, with known solution 

information, organizations can maximize their resources. Once those issues are fully triaged and taken care of, they can 

then focus on less severe issues.

Beyond CVE: Uncovering the Hidden 
Vulnerability Landscape 

Organizations strictly relying on CVE are likely unaware of nearly a third of known vulnerability risk. Flashpoint has 

documented over 100,000 vulnerabilities that CVE has failed to report, many of which affect major vendors such as 

Google and Microsoft. Flashpoint’s non\-CVE coverage has also identified a significant number of issues affecting 

numerous third\-party libraries—in addition to zero\-day and in\-the\-wild exploits that are being used by threat actors.

As of February 2024, Flashpoint analysts have cataloged 330 vulnerabilities that were discovered being 

exploited in the wild, that still do not have a CVE ID. These include vulnerabilities in:

• Adobe Reader

• Apple iOS

• Apple macOS

• Google Android

• Microsoft SQL Server

• Siemens SIMATIC

• Solarwinds Orion Platform

As of February 2024, the following have been exploited in some form of malware, yet do not have a CVE ID:

• Apache Hadoop

• PHP

• Google Authenticator for Android

Any vulnerability management team that feels underserved by their current coverage needs visibility into non\-CVE 

issues—especially if they are leveraging legacy or end\-of\-life software. Having immediate access to actionable data 

empowers security teams to address issues, sometimes as fast as two weeks compared to CVE.

Ransomware

The data in this section comprises victimized organizations that have been announced on ransomware blogs 

and leak sites. Data is current to the date of publishing.

Ransomware plays a massive role within the threat intelligence landscape. Flashpoint identified a significant 

escalation in ransomware attacks across all sectors in 2023, with the total rising to 5,028 attacks—an 84% 

YoY increase (2,720\).

known ransomware attacks in 2023\. The group has 

gained notoriety for its sophisticated and ruthless 

strain of ransomware. Recent analysis of a possible 

LockBit 4\.0 variant noted functionality that includes 

randomizing the victims’ file naming to complicate 

restoration efforts, a self\-delete mechanism that 

overwrites LockBit’s own file contents with null bytes, 

and the ability to delete victims’ shadow copies and 

backups to inhibit recovery. Coupled with their harsh 

negotiation practices, including the use of a triple 

extortion method, victims of LockBit are often left to 

grapple with difficult decisions.

On February 20, 2024, US authorities, in collaboration with the UK’s National Crime Agency and additional 

international allies, announced the disruption of the LockBit ransomware group as part of a concerted initiative known 

as “Operation Cronos.”

Despite the success of Operation Cronos, the LockBit ransomware collective has persisted. They quickly established 

a new Dark Web blog, alleging that law enforcement only managed to seize control of a segment of their operations. 

According to its new site, they have resumed their ransomware operations, though these assertions have not been 

confirmed as of this publishing. Even with LockBit’s continued activities post\-disruption, indications are suggesting that 

Operation Cronos has had a more significant impact on their operations than they are willing to admit.

2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report13 
Nevertheless, as of this publishing, LockBit remains the most prolific ransomware group in 2024, 
documenting 154 public victim announcements on their leak site within the first two months alone—almost 
triple the number of the second most active groups (8Base, BlackCat). There’s a possibility that the group 
could recover. However, even if they don’t, numerous other cybercriminal factions are poised to take their 
place, indicating that the fight against cybercrime is expected to persist indefinitely. 

So far in 2024, the frequency and severity of ransomware attacks on organizations have increased, with 637 
public ransomware attacks in the first two months, up from 518 in the same period of 2023\. To mitigate this 
rising threat, it’s crucial for organizations to develop and implement robust prevention and response 
strategies proactively. Delaying these discussions until after an attack occurs significantly hampers the 
ability to reduce its impact.

The construction and engineering sector 
emerged as the most targeted industry by 
ransomware in 2023, with 416 public 
incidents. The professional services, internet 
software and services, and healthcare sectors 
were also heavily targeted in 2023, 
highlighting the cross\-industry impact of 
ransomware and the critical need for 
sector\-specific defense strategies. In the first 
two months of 2024, the construction and 
engineering sector remained the most 
targeted with 57 public attacks so far. The 
manufacturing and healthcare sectors follow 
behind, each with 49 public attacks in the first 
two months of 2024\. These critical 
infrastructure sectors share several 
commonalities that make them lucrative for 
ransomware groups:

1\. They each contain rich amounts of senstive and confidential data that threat actors can hold ransom or 

exploit for financial gain.

2\. Because of both the sensitivity of the data they possess (for sectors like healthcare), and the high costs 
of operation that make it expensive to halt during ransom negotiations (for sectors like manufacturing 
and construction and engineering), organizations in these sectors may have a higher willingness to pay 
the ransom.

3\. These organizations often generate higher amounts of revenue, which means ransomers can yield a 

higher profit per victim compared to other industries.

4\. They rely on operational technology that could contain vulnerabilities, providing a window for threat 

actors to gain access to victims’ systems.

2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report14Geographically, the United States bore the brunt of 

ransomware attacks, with 2,386 incidents , reflecting 

its status as a major target due to its economic 

significance and digital infrastructure.

Emerging Extortion Tactics...

As ransomware groups become more sophisticated, threat actors are becoming increasingly hostile and 

brazen as well. They are adopting new tactics to add external pressures. This includes doxxing executives, 

threatening to release embarrassing or sensitive information, or notifying the victim’s stakeholders that 

the company has been breached and is not willing to pay to protect compromised data—all to increase the 

likelihood of payment. The “extortion economy” represents a growing risk to organizations that parallels 

many ransomware threats.

To add further complexity, the lines between overt malicious actors and self\-proclaimed ethical hackers 

are increasingly blurred. Consequently, organizations must actively engage in these environments to 

preemptively counter threats and adapt strategies from ransomware response playbooks to address these 

lesser\-known extortion techniques.

Data Encryption: The most well\-known tactic of using malware to lock or encode a victim’s data, 

demanding payment for its decryption and release.

Data Extortion: Threats have evolved from just ransom demands to broader threats of public 

data exposure.

Unethical Vulnerability Disclosures: While many ethical hackers aim to responsibly disclose 

vulnerabilities, some blur the lines by tying their discoveries to monetary demands.

Underground Economies’ Influence: Beyond merely trading stolen data, Dark Web marketplaces 

increase the value of this data, treating it as a secondary market commodity to gain access to 

victims’ systems.

Access Brokers: The sale of unauthorized system access is on the rise, often serving as the precursor 

to multifaceted cyber attacks. 

Distributed Denial\-of\-Service (DDoS) Attacks: Attackers overwhelm a target’s online services, causing 

them to be unavailable. They then demand a ransom to stop the attack.

Physical Threats Related to Cyber Activities: Extortionists sometimes combine cyber threats with 

physical threats, suggesting harm might come to a victim or their loved ones unless demands related to 

cyber activities are met.

Implement Robust Encryption and Backup Procedures: To counter data encryption tactics, 

organizations should ensure that all sensitive data is encrypted and regularly backed up to secure, 

off\-site locations. This minimizes the impact of ransomware attacks by allowing organizations to restore 

encrypted data without paying a ransom.

Advanced Threat Detection and Response: Employ advanced threat detection systems that utilize 

machine learning and AI to identify unusual data access or transfer patterns, indicative of data extortion 

attempts. Establish a swift incident response plan to contain and mitigate threats before they escalate.

Vulnerability Management Program: Develop a comprehensive vulnerability management program 

that includes regular security assessments, penetration testing, and the prompt patching of software 

vulnerabilities. This reduces the risk of unethical vulnerability disclosures and ensures that potential 

security gaps are addressed before they can be exploited.

Monitor and Analyze Dark Web Activities: Engage in continuous monitoring of Dark Web forums 

and marketplaces to understand the latest trends in underground economies. Utilize this intelligence 

to strengthen your security posture against emerging threats and to be aware of any mention of your 

organization’s data on these platforms.

Zero Trust Architecture: Adopt a zero\-trust security model that verifies every user and device trying 

to access your network, regardless of their location. This approach minimizes the risk posed by access

Executive Director of Global Security

Beyond Bytes and Bullets: 
Shaping the Future of Allied Threat Intelligence

Strategies for integrating OSINT capabilities with cyber, physical, and geopolitical 

intelligence to proactively fight global security threats.

The need for a holistic, integrated approach to intelligence and security has never been more acute. The 
challenges ahead are not only defending against attacks and increasing resilience; they lie in understanding 
and shaping the future of intelligence in a world where the digital and physical realms are inexorably linked.

The importance of high\-fidelity, high\-reliability data in this context cannot be overstated, as it forms the very 
backbone of an intelligence enterprise that enables various decision makers to distill actionable insights from 
vast streams of information. Governments must make informed decisions to safeguard national interests and 
those of their allies. Private enterprises and corporate boards need insights to protect themselves from a 
growing field of e\-crime actors and state\-backed threats. Universities and research institutions must protect 
intellectual property. Global media entities need means to help validate trusted information and to debunk 
false narratives that may be amplified with deepakes and generative AI.

Navigating this new era demands not just vigilance but innovation, as we chart a course through the 
intertwined fog of digital and physical conflicts to safeguard our collective future. 

Converging Threats Across Conflicts 
and Competitive Domains

Ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the Israel\-Hamas War in 
Gaza, expanding proxy violence in the Middle East, rising tensions in 
the Taiwan Strait, and new forms of large scale data theft and 
extortion all underscore a near\-term future fraught with increasingly 
complex geopolitical and cyber challenges. This emerging landscape 
demands a profound reevaluation of how nations, non\-state actors, 
and intelligence communities navigate the intelligence needed 
for warfare, peacekeeping, and protecting prosperity in our 
interconnected world.

This emerging landscape 
demands a profound 
reevaluation of how 
nations, non\-state actors, 
and intelligence 
communities navigate the 
intelligence needed for 
warfare, peacekeeping, 
and protecting 
prosperity in our 
interconnected world.

Through lenses of what is generally termed Great Power Competition 
by allies, and Hybrid Warfare or Unrestricted Warfare by adversaries, our understanding of global security is 
in a pivotal phase of transformation. This digital transformation and the entanglement of commercial, 
government, and nonstate actors across an observed fragmentation of the cyber domain calls security 
professionals toward a unified intelligence framework to seamlessly integrate cyber and physical threat 

intelligence in real time and at scale.

Developing Professionally\-Sourced Intelligence 
(Pro\-SINT) within OSINT 

As we confront these multifaceted threats, we may need to embrace a subtle distinction between 
Open\-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and a subset that I call Professionally\-Sourced Intelligence (Pro\-SINT). 
What I unofficially refer to as “Pro\-SINT” is distinct from a growing set of crowdsourced, hobbyist, and other 
unfiltered OSINT efforts using publicly\-available information. Pro\-SINT leverages more proprietary and 
commercially\-available information and is marked by professional standards, oversight, privacy compliance, 
ability to collaborate with law enforcement entities, and most importantly a deep commitment to a set of 
international ethics that aligns with those of allied governments, regulated industries, and a scientific 
standard for verification and auditability.

The type of Professional OSINTer I’ve described, may reside in a government, a company, an NGO, or a 
university, but they all share a focus on deep\-web data, Dark Web exploration, cyber\-physical convergence, 
and sophisticated analysis, enriching traditional human observational intelligence methods and analytical 
judgment with the technologies required to provide nuanced insights at scale among the complex interplay 
of cyber and physical threats in real time. 

Professional OSINT is not only about enhancing defensive measures or reducing mean times to resolution of 
vulnerabilities, but about preemptively understanding and countering the strategic moves of adversaries, 
frequently seen in the chatter of encrypted communications preceding abrupt attacks or indicating 
persistent intrusion. Moreover, the integration of well\-trained and auditable artificial intelligence and 
machine learning technologies into intelligence operations for commercially\-available information offers 
unprecedented capabilities in detecting deepfakes and other sophisticated cyber threats, further enhancing 
our ability to anticipate and mitigate potential escalations in both cyber and kinetic domains, bolstering 
security postures for individual organizations, governments, and alliances.

A professional ethos is also essential to navigate the complexities introduced by decentralized platforms and 
Dark Web tools, which, while enabling resilience against censorship and protection from hostile surveillance 
in many parts of the world, also can pose challenges in distinguishing credible intelligence from 

misinformation in open societies. 

Challenges in Decentralized Communications 
and the Dark Web

A unique aspect of a hybrid digital evolution has been the role of decentralized communication platforms 
and the expanding use of Dark Web communications by both threat actors and friendly users with legitimate 
needs for protection and undetected attribution. 

These platforms have transcended their initial purposes to become digital command centers and 
sanctuaries for many unfiltered narratives. Their observed impact in facilitating real\-time, unedited 
 information flows during the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza has been profound, underscoring the blurring 
lines between cyber, information, and kinetic warfare and highlighting the strategic significance of data in 
modern warfare. 

flashpoint.io

2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report18 
Cross\-platform, encrypted messaging, and Dark Web service platforms have also proved useful sources for 
key insights into the strategic, operational, and tactical context of challenges including proxy violence in the 
Middle East, tensions in the Taiwan Strait, hostile espionage activities against allies, in addition to the evolving 
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by cyber 
criminals for extortion or fraud.

Increase in Scale and 

Impact of Attacks

In this initial phase,
attacks increase in scope and 
sophistication, evolving from

(DDoS) attacks.

Strengthening collaboration among allies becomes crucial as we collectively counteract the threats posed by 
adversaries and protect shared economic interests and democratic values in cyberspace. However, achieving 
such unity in intelligence and security efforts presents its own set of challenges. Divergent political interests, 
varying levels of technological sophistication, and concerns over sovereignty and privacy can hinder the 
formation of a cohesive global threat picture for allies across public sector and private sector pillars. 
Recognizing these differences and ensuring an ability to appropriately tailor data collection and use for each 
individual client is paramount as we strive for a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to professional 

security intelligence.

2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report19 
Toward a Unified Approach to Global Security Intelligence 

The interwoven nature of ongoing wars, global conflicts, and the critical role of digital platforms in these 
dynamics underscore the imperative for comprehensive and forward\-looking intelligence collaboration 
strategies. These strategies must not only address the immediate challenges posed by the current 
geopolitical and cyber threats but also anticipate the evolving nature of warfare, espionage, and transnational 
criminal enterprise. 

The insights gained by professional OSINTers are indispensable in this endeavor, enabling responses that are 
as dynamic and multifaceted as the threats faced by our clients. 

In navigating this complex landscape, a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to security becomes 
paramount. By fostering unity among commercial enterprises, governmental agencies, and international 
partners, we can develop robust, adaptable security strategies that transcend traditional paradigms. This 
unified approach, leveraging the latest technological advancements and prioritizing ethical, legal, and political 
frameworks, is our best defense against the insidious threats that seek to undermine our institutions, 
economies, and democracies. 

Embracing the interconnected world as it is, not as we wish it to be, is a key first step. It requires 
understanding the criticality of machine speed and scale in the digital domain, while always remembering 
that humans are more important than hardware. Developing high\-fidelity data sourcing and high\-trust 
professional networks will help us protect the foundations of our global society alongside our allies and in 
defense of our collective security. Our shared prosperity demands it. 

Security and intelligence professionals all face a new hybrid era. The global threat landscape is transforming 
and scaling—fortunately, so are we.

Case Study 

Leveraging Threat Intelligence in Public Safety Missions: 
Investigating Sales of Fentanyl Precursors

In the complex global security challenge posed by the trafficking of synthetic opioids like fentanyl, the 

importance of open\-source intelligence (OSINT) in public safety missions cannot be overstated. Flashpoint 

National Security Solutions (FNSS) stands at the forefront of addressing these challenges by providing 

tailored intelligence that empowers government and public sector entities to conduct effective 

investigations. 

This case study explores how Flashpoint’s advanced OSINT capabilities have empowered government and 

public sector agencies to unravel the sophisticated networks behind the sales of fentanyl precursors 

(chemicals used to manufacture the synthetic opioid) on digital platforms. By dissecting the digital footprint 

of the fentanyl precursor trade, Flashpoint provides the critical tools and intelligence needed for public safety 

and national security teams to anticipate, mitigate, and disrupt these illicit activities effectively. 

The Challenge

The trafficking of synthetic opioids has reached alarming levels, with threat actors employing increasingly 

sophisticated methods to evade detection. In particular, the sale of fentanyl precursors—often advertised 

openly yet obscured through scientific nomenclature and digital platforms—poses significant hurdles for law 

enforcement and public safety agencies. To effectively understand, counteract, and dismantle these illicit 

networks, adopting an innovative investigative strategy—integrating both proprietary technology and 

open\-source intelligence—is crucial, as illustrated in the accompanying chart.

The Solution

In response to the growing threat, Flashpoint analysts embarked on an investigation targeting the sale of 

fentanyl precursors, particularly those originating from Chinese chemical manufacturing companies. Utilizing 

a multi\-faceted approach, the team leveraged: 

• The Flashpoint intelligence platform for insights into synthetic opioid trafficking trends on the Deep and 

Dark Web (DDW) and social media

• Optical character recognition (OCR) to sift through digital images for hidden clues

• Open\-source intelligence for additional context on trafficked substances

• Advanced data mining techniques to sift through vast datasets, including social media chatter, market 

advertisements, and digital communications

• Echosec, a component of Flashpoint’s Physical Security Intelligence suite, to expand the investigation 

into a broader array of social media platforms

• Corporate data sources to investigate the ownership and operational structures of companies involved in 

the precursor trade

The Results 

The investigation unveiled a complex web of Chinese chemical companies involved in the manufacture and 

distribution of fentanyl precursors. Despite China’s regulatory efforts, these entities have found ways to cater 

to the US market, often using mislabeling tactics and intermediaries to skirt US laws. Flashpoint’s analysis 

revealed: 

• Indictments against several companies and individuals for their role in the fentanyl precursor trade

• Advertisement strategies employed by these companies on various digital platforms, including social 

media and dedicated websites

• The use of advanced money\-laundering techniques and encrypted communication platforms like WeChat 

to facilitate operations

Closing Thoughts 

Taken together, the data and analysis in the Flashpoint 2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report depict a 

landscape of threats that continue to grow in volume and complexity, from ransomware attacks and data 

breaches to vulnerability exploitation and geopolitical conflict. Three themes rise above as takeaways to 

navigate this challenging environment:

Anticipate and adapt to the convergence of 
cyber, physical, and geopolitical threats. 
As attacks increasingly target where geopolitical and commercial interests intersect—

then take hybrid forms—organizations must not get caught in their traditional silos of 

functions and geographies. New levels of collaboration are required both within and 

outside of organizations, from the sharing of data and analysis to defining the protocols 

to act decisively on it. 

Raise the bar on the actionability of data. 
It is impractical for security teams to grow at the same rate as the attacks that we’ve 

reported on in this report. More data isn’t the solution to staying a step ahead; it’s about 

the quality, actionability, and tailoring of data to an organization’s specific needs. 

Harness the power of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) 
in service of human intelligence, not in place of it. 
AI is already delivering powerful capabilities to help organizations distill overwhelming 

amounts of information about potential threats. Amid the hype, however, some have lost 

sight of the central role of human intelligence in marshaling this power. The adversaries 

documented in this report will be less effective when matched with the combination of 

human expertise and technology on the other side.

By offering these threat data sets, insights and recommendations, this report has aimed to illuminate a 

path forward, empowering readers not only to confront the challenges of today but also to anticipate the 

risks of tomorrow.
