## Foreword: On Resilience and Security in 2024 by Josh Lefkowitz
 
In the evolving landscape of global security, where cyber and physical threats increasingly converge, the Flashpoint     
2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report offers a critical examination of the current threat environment. This year’s  
analysis goes beyond traditional threat intelligence, incorporating Flashpoint’s unparalleled data and insights to shed light 
on cyber threats, geopolitical turmoil, and escalating physical conflicts around the world. The goal: help your organization 
to strengthen its defenses, ensure operational resilience, and proactively confront multifaceted threats—thereby  
safeguarding critical assets, preventing financial losses, and protecting lives.
Cyber threats remain at the forefront of global security challenges, as opportunistic and resilient adversaries exploit 
vulnerabilities through sophisticated tactics. Our annual report details the continuing surge of ransomware attacks, data 
breach trends, and the exploitation of vulnerabilities, underscoring the evolving nature of cyber risks. Sectors rich in  
sensitive and confidential data continue to be prime targets, emphasizing the critical need for robust cybersecurity  
measures and actionable intelligence to counter threats and protect assets. 
Looking ahead through 2024, we see the ongoing convergence of cyber and physical threats exacerbated by  
escalating geopolitical unrest. These include crucial elections, the continuous conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the 
Israel-Hamas War, and strategic tensions in the Taiwan Strait, each adding layers of complexity to the global threat  
landscape.
A notable highlight of our annual report is its focus on the central role of open-source intelligence (OSINT) in addressing 
not only cyber threats but also physical security challenges. In these pages, Flashpoint Executive Director of Global  
Security, Andrew Borene, provides his perspective on the next evolution of OSINT. The importance of OSINT is further 
detailed through a case study about its role in an investigation of fentanyl precursor sales. This investigation reveals the 
complex networks behind illicit activities, showcasing the effectiveness of integrated intelligence in dismantling such 
operations to enhance public safety and national security. 
I invite you to explore the insights provided in the report and to utilize it as a  
cornerstone for constructing a more resilient and secure future. As we navigate this  
complex landscape, reinforcing our defenses against threats that seek to compromise 
our collective security, the Flashpoint 2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report  
illuminates the path forward, offering a beacon of clarity in a sea of uncertainty.

## Executive Overview: Cyber Threats at a Glance
Data Breaches Rose 34.5% in 2023. 
 
Flashpoint recorded 6,077 data breach incidents in 2023. More than 70% of these stolen 
records—which include everything from financial data to personal health records—stemmed 
from direct compromise or via an affected third-party. 
17Bn Records Stolen in 2023. 
 
From January 1 to February 29, 2024, the number of stolen or leaked personal data spiked 
more than 4X compared to the same period last year. Unauthorized access and ransomware 
remain the primary culprits behind data breaches, accounting for over half of the incidents 
impacting major industries. 
35% of Vulnerabilities in 2023 
Had Known Public Exploits. 
 
Prioritization continues to be challenging as the number of new technologies is introduced 
into the market, with 2023 marking a significant peak of 33,137 issues. Of those issues, 35% 
had known public exploits. Moving into 2024, Flashpoint continues to observe similar trends 
in vulnerability totals, disclosure rates, and exploitability. 
Ransomware Attacks Rose by 84% in 2023. 
 
After leveraging both zero-day and disclosed vulnerabilities to gain illegal access,  
financially motivated threat actors take additional actions on objectives, like installing 
ransomware. Flashpoint identified a significant increase in ransomware attacks across 
all sectors in 2023, resulting in an increase of 84% YoY. In the first two months of 2024 
alone, the number of public ransomware attacks has grown nearly 23% compared to the 
same period in 2023.

## Key Threat Landscapes: Data and Insights
### Data Breaches
Flashpoint breach data and intelligence, as detailed in this section, comprises the Deep and Dark Web and  
open sources, including public attorney general reports, ransomware blogs, and Freedom of Information Act  
(FOIA) requests. Data is current to the date of publishing.
 
 
Flashpoint observed a significant uptick in 
data breach activity in 2023, with our analysts 
recording 6,077 publicly reported data  
breaches—a 34.5% increase compared to 
2022. Data breaches are responsible for  
leaking over 17 billion personal records that 
included sensitive information such as names, 
social security numbers, and financial data.  
Over 70% of these incidents were the result 
of unauthorized access that stemmed from  
outside the affected organization. 
 
 
 
 
The United States represented more than 60% of  
the global data breach total, reporting 3,804 data  
breaches—a 19.8% increase compared to 2022. In the 
first two months of 2024 alone, data breaches have  
increased by an additional 30% compared to the  
previous year, within the same period.

However, of all incidents recorded last year, one cyberattack  
in particular had a profound impact on the data breach  
landscape—Cl0p’s exploitation of a vulnerability within  
the MOVEit file transfer application. By leveraging a  
vulnerability within the MOVEit Transfer file application  
(VulnDB ID: 322555, CVE 2023-34362), the ransomware 
group had compromised numerous organizations by the end 
of 2023, either directly or through third-party compromise. 
Looking specifically at public breach disclosures, Flashpoint 
analysts determined that the MOVEit attack was responsible 
for 19.3% of all reported 2023 data breaches. This figure 
includes affected third-parties, organizations who were not 
directly compromised by Cl0p, but had sensitive data stolen 
from vendors within their supply chain.
Unauthorized Access Is Up In 2024. 
 
As we move forward into 2024, the data breach landscape is seeing a 
significant spike in stolen or leaked personal data. From January 1 -  
February 29, 2024, threat actors compromised 1.897 billion personal 
records and credentials—a 429% increase compared to the same period 
last year. Five data breach incidents have had an outsized impact:

The Effect of Ransomware and  
Unauthorized Access on Key Industries 
 
To gain context into potential risks, organizations need to be aware of how the data breach landscape specifically affects 
their industry. How are threat actors gaining access into systems? Understanding the answer to this question is critical to 
forming safeguards and response plans.
Ransomware and Unauthorized Access Are  
the Top Two Causes of Data Breaches in 2023.  
 
Together, they are responsible for more than half of all incidents experienced by major sectors. However, for the  
manufacturing and technology industries, ransomware and unauthorized access accounted for more than 85% of all  
publicly disclosed breach incidents. This data further illustrates the need for robust threat intelligence and vulnerability  
management programs that can help reduce risk, prevent losses, and maintain day-to-day operations.

### Vulnerabilities
The data in this section comprises Flashpoint’s vulnerability intelligence, covering all attack surfaces—including  
vendors, endpoints, cloud, Internet of things (IoT), operational technology, open source software (OSS), and third-party 
libraries and dependencies. Flashpoint’s vulnerability enrichment provides full context into metadata such as EPSS, 
exploit intelligence, social risk, and ransomware likelihood. Data is current to the date of publishing.
From a threat actor’s perspective, unpatched vulnerabilities are opportunities to gain access into an organization. By  
exploiting them, vulnerabilities allow malicious actors to spread through compromised networks—allowing them to  
perform a wide variety of actions that may ultimately result in data loss or exposure. However, due to the increasing 
disclosure of vulnerabilities from an expanded digital ecosystem, organizations may be unaware of vulnerabilities within 
their networks. One major blind spot occurs when enterprises strictly rely on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure 
(CVE) database, which is missing over 100,000 vulnerabilities—nearly a third of known vulnerability risk. 
 
Flashpoint vulnerability intelligence shows that 
disclosed vulnerabilities have displayed a  
consistent upward trend, with 2023 marking a 
significant peak at 33,137 disclosures. This  
progressive increase underscores the  
escalating challenge for cybersecurity defenses, 
as it is unfeasible for any organization, regardless 
of maturity, to triage and remediate all of these 
issues in a timely manner. 
 
The efficient identification, prioritization, and 
remediation of vulnerabilities are crucial in 
 
preventing or mitigating the impact of 
breaches and cyber attacks. However, security 
teams will continue to face challenges as the 
total number of vulnerabilities increases and 
new issues are disclosed at a consistent rate. 
Throughout 2023, the distribution of  
vulnerabilities per month has seen little  
fluctuation, with the number of vulnerabilities 
being disclosed ranging from 2,425 to 3,111. 
Moving into 2024, Flashpoint is observing 
similar disclosure totals.

Further examining the rate of vulnerability disclosures, looking at the top 10 days in 2023 with the most reported  
vulnerabilities, there is a consistent trend: they all take place on the second Tuesday of each month. This is no  
coincidence as Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday has always played a major role in every year’s rising totals. As more vendors 
adopt Microsoft’s monthly disclosure schedule, organizations will need a timely and actionable source of vulnerability 
intelligence to help reduce the need for lengthy manual research. 
 
Severity’s effect on prioritization 
 
Flashpoint vulnerability intelligence shows that nearly 52% of all vulnerabilities disclosed in 2023 are scored high to  
critical (7.0 to 10.0) in severity, according to CVSSv3. For most organizations, vulnerabilities scored between 7.0 to 10.0 
are considered to be a major risk, but if more than half of the year’s total meet this criteria, which ones should be  
prioritized? Remediation is a timely process, and if vulnerability management teams are expected to triage all of these 
issues, it is highly possible that many of these issues will go unpatched. 
Organizations should also be aware that the National Vulner-
ability Database (NVD) no longer provides base scores for 
CVSSv2, and has instead opted to score using CVSSv3. This is 
significant for three reasons. 
- Many organizations still currently choose to rely on CVSSv2 
for prioritization.
- Due to differences in scoring methodologies, a vulnerability 
scored in CVSSv2 can vary greatly from CVSSv3, which can 
have a major impact on prioritization.
- CVSSv4 was released in November 2023.

Flashpoint has found that categorizing high severity vulnerabilities based on the following criteria can have 
 massive benefits for vulnerability management teams:
- Remotely exploitable
- Known public exploit
- Known solution details
 
 
 
 
Adopting this model can  
allow vulnerability management teams to 
cut their critical workloads by nearly 85%. 
 
By shifting immediate attention to issues that are remotely exploitable that have public exploits, with known solution 
information, organizations can maximize their resources. Once those issues are fully triaged and taken care of, they can 
then focus on less severe issues.

Beyond CVE: Uncovering the Hidden  
Vulnerability Landscape 
 
Organizations strictly relying on CVE are likely unaware of nearly a third of known vulnerability risk. Flashpoint has  
documented over 100,000 vulnerabilities that CVE has failed to report, many of which affect major vendors such as  
Google and Microsoft. Flashpoint’s non-CVE coverage has also identified a significant number of issues affecting  
numerous third-party libraries—in addition to zero-day and in-the-wild exploits that are being used by threat actors. 
 
As of February 2024, Flashpoint analysts have cataloged 330 vulnerabilities that were discovered being  
exploited in the wild, that still do not have a CVE ID. These include vulnerabilities in:
- Adobe Reader
- Apple iOS
- Apple macOS
- Google Android
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Siemens SIMATIC
- Solarwinds Orion Platform
As of February 2024, the following have been exploited in some form of malware, yet do not have a CVE ID:
- Apache Hadoop
- Google Authenticator for Android
- PHP
Any vulnerability management team that feels underserved by their current coverage needs visibility into non-CVE  
issues—especially if they are leveraging legacy or end-of-life software. Having immediate access to actionable data  
empowers security teams to address issues, sometimes as fast as two weeks compared to CVE.

### Ransomware
The data in this section comprises victimized organizations that have been announced on ransomware blogs  
and leak sites. Data is current to the date of publishing.
 
Ransomware plays a massive role within the threat intelligence landscape. Flashpoint identified a significant  
escalation in ransomware attacks across all sectors in 2023, with the total rising to 5,028 attacks—an 84%  
YoY increase (2,720).
LockBit was the most prolific ransomware group of 
the year, claiming 1,049 victims—over one fifth of all 
known ransomware attacks in 2023. The group has 
gained notoriety for its sophisticated and ruthless 
strain of ransomware. Recent analysis of a possible 
LockBit 4.0 variant noted functionality that includes  
randomizing the victims’ file naming to complicate 
restoration efforts, a self-delete mechanism that 
overwrites LockBit’s own file contents with null bytes, 
and the ability to delete victims’ shadow copies and 
backups to inhibit recovery. Coupled with their harsh 
negotiation practices, including the use of a triple 
extortion method, victims of LockBit are often left to 
grapple with difficult decisions.

On February 20, 2024, US authorities, in collaboration with the UK’s National Crime Agency and additional 
international allies, announced the disruption of the LockBit ransomware group as part of a concerted initiative known  
as “Operation Cronos.”
Despite the success of Operation Cronos, the LockBit ransomware collective has persisted. They quickly established 
a new Dark Web blog, alleging that law enforcement only managed to seize control of a segment of their operations. 
According to its new site, they have resumed their ransomware operations, though these assertions have not been 
confirmed as of this publishing. Even with LockBit’s continued activities post-disruption, indications are suggesting that 
Operation Cronos has had a more significant impact on their operations than they are willing to admit.
 
![Seven Stages of a Ransomware Attack Diagram]
2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report

Nevertheless, as of this publishing, LockBit remains the most prolific ransomware group in 2024,  
documenting 154 public victim announcements on their leak site within the first two months alone—almost 
triple the number of the second most active groups (8Base, BlackCat). There’s a possibility that the group 
could recover. However, even if they don’t, numerous other cybercriminal factions are poised to take their 
place, indicating that the fight against cybercrime is expected to persist indefinitely. 
So far in 2024, the frequency and severity of ransomware attacks on organizations have increased, with 637 
public ransomware attacks in the first two months, up from 518 in the same period of 2023. To mitigate this 
rising threat, it’s crucial for organizations to develop and implement robust prevention and response  
strategies proactively. Delaying these discussions until after an attack occurs significantly hampers the  
ability to reduce its impact.
The construction and engineering sector 
emerged as the most targeted industry by 
ransomware in 2023, with 416 public  
incidents. The professional services, internet 
software and services, and healthcare sectors 
were also heavily targeted in 2023,  
highlighting the cross-industry impact of  
ransomware and the critical need for  
sector-specific defense strategies. In the first 
two months of 2024, the construction and  
engineering sector remained the most  
targeted with 57 public attacks so far. The 
manufacturing and healthcare sectors follow 
behind, each with 49 public attacks in the first 
two months of 2024. These critical  
infrastructure sectors share several  
commonalities that make them lucrative for 
ransomware groups:
1. They each contain rich amounts of senstive and confidential data that threat actors can hold ransom or 
exploit for financial gain.
2. Because of both the sensitivity of the data they possess (for sectors like healthcare), and the high costs  
of operation that make it expensive to halt during ransom negotiations (for sectors like manufacturing  
and construction and engineering), organizations in these sectors may have a higher willingness to pay  
the ransom.
3. These organizations often generate higher amounts of revenue, which means ransomers can yield a  
higher profit per victim compared to other industries.
4. They rely on operational technology that could contain vulnerabilities, providing a window for threat  
actors to gain access to victims’ systems.

Emerging Extortion Tactics...
As ransomware groups become more sophisticated, threat actors are becoming increasingly hostile and 
brazen as well. They are adopting new tactics to add external pressures. This includes doxxing executives, 
threatening to release embarrassing or sensitive information, or notifying the victim’s stakeholders that  
the company has been breached and is not willing to pay to protect compromised data—all to increase the  
likelihood of payment. The “extortion economy” represents a growing risk to organizations that parallels 
many ransomware threats.
To add further complexity, the lines between overt malicious actors and self-proclaimed ethical hackers  
are increasingly blurred. Consequently, organizations must actively engage in these environments to  
preemptively counter threats and adapt strategies from ransomware response playbooks to address these 
lesser-known extortion techniques.  
1. Data Encryption: The most well-known tactic of using malware to lock or encode a victim’s data,  
demanding payment for its decryption and release.
2. Data Extortion: Threats have evolved from just ransom demands to broader threats of public  
data exposure.
3. Unethical Vulnerability Disclosures: While many ethical hackers aim to responsibly disclose  
vulnerabilities, some blur the lines by tying their discoveries to monetary demands.
4. Underground Economies’ Influence: Beyond merely trading stolen data, Dark Web marketplaces  
increase the value of this data, treating it as a secondary market commodity to gain access to  
victims’ systems.
5. Access Brokers: The sale of unauthorized system access is on the rise, often serving as the precursor 
to multifaceted cyber attacks. 
6. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks: Attackers overwhelm a target’s online services, causing 
them to be unavailable. They then demand a ransom to stop the attack.
7. Physical Threats Related to Cyber Activities: Extortionists sometimes combine cyber threats with  
physical threats, suggesting harm might come to a victim or their loved ones unless demands related to 
cyber activities are met.
Geographically, the  United States  bore the brunt of  
ransomware attacks, with  2,386 incidents , reflecting  
its status as a major target due to its economic  
significance and digital infrastructure.
2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report
flashpoint.io
15
...And How to Fight Back 
1. Implement Robust Encryption and Backup Procedures: To counter data encryption tactics,  
organizations should ensure that all sensitive data is encrypted and regularly backed up to secure,  
off-site locations. This minimizes the impact of ransomware attacks by allowing organizations to restore 
encrypted data without paying a ransom.
2. Advanced Threat Detection and Response: Employ advanced threat detection systems that utilize 
machine learning and AI to identify unusual data access or transfer patterns, indicative of data extortion 
attempts. Establish a swift incident response plan to contain and mitigate threats before they escalate.
3. Vulnerability Management Program: Develop a comprehensive vulnerability management program 
that includes regular security assessments, penetration testing, and the prompt patching of software 
vulnerabilities. This reduces the risk of unethical vulnerability disclosures and ensures that potential 
security gaps are addressed before they can be exploited.
4. Monitor and Analyze Dark Web Activities: Engage in continuous monitoring of Dark Web forums 
and marketplaces to understand the latest trends in underground economies. Utilize this intelligence 
to strengthen your security posture against emerging threats and to be aware of any mention of your 
organization’s data on these platforms.
5. Zero Trust Architecture: Adopt a zero-trust security model that verifies every user and device trying 
to access your network, regardless of their location. This approach minimizes the risk posed by access 
brokers by ensuring that access is strictly controlled and monitored.
6. Protect Against DDoS Attacks. Implement DDoS protection solutions that can detect and mitigate 
large-scale DDoS attacks. These services can help maintain the availability of online services during an 
attack, reducing the attackers’ leverage for ransom demands.
7. Employee Education and Physical Security Measures: Educate employees about the risks of cyber 
threats and the importance of physical security. This includes training on recognizing phishing attempts, 
securing personal and company devices, and reporting any suspicious activities. Enhance physical  
security measures to protect against threats that merge cyber and physical elements.

## Commentary: Beyond Bytes and Bullets: Shaping the Future of Allied Threat Intelligence
Strategies for integrating OSINT capabilities with cyber, physical, and geopolitical  
intelligence to proactively fight global security threats.
 
The need for a holistic, integrated approach to intelligence and security has never been more acute. The  
challenges ahead are not only defending against attacks and increasing resilience; they lie in understanding 
and shaping the future of intelligence in a world where the digital and physical realms are inexorably linked.
The importance of high-fidelity, high-reliability data in this context cannot be overstated, as it forms the very 
backbone of an intelligence enterprise that enables various decision makers to distill actionable insights from 
vast streams of information. Governments must make informed decisions to safeguard national interests and 
those of their allies. Private enterprises and corporate boards need insights to protect themselves from a 
growing field of e-crime actors and state-backed threats. Universities and research institutions must protect 
intellectual property. Global media entities need means to help validate trusted information and to debunk 
false narratives that may be amplified with deepakes and generative AI.
Navigating this new era demands not just vigilance but innovation, as we chart a course through the  
intertwined fog of digital and physical conflicts to safeguard our collective future. 
Converging Threats Across Conflicts  
and Competitive Domains
Ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas War in 
Gaza, expanding proxy violence in the Middle East, rising tensions in 
the Taiwan Strait, and new forms of large scale data theft and  
extortion all underscore a near-term future fraught with increasingly 
complex geopolitical and cyber challenges. This emerging landscape 
demands a profound reevaluation of how nations, non-state actors, 
and intelligence communities navigate the intelligence needed  
for warfare, peacekeeping, and protecting prosperity in our  
interconnected world.
Through lenses of what is generally termed Great Power Competition 
by allies, and Hybrid Warfare or Unrestricted Warfare by adversaries, our understanding of global security is 
in a pivotal phase of transformation. This digital transformation and the entanglement of commercial,  
government, and nonstate actors across an observed fragmentation of the cyber domain calls security  
professionals toward a unified intelligence framework to seamlessly integrate cyber and physical threat  
intelligence in real time and at scale. 
This emerging landscape 
demands a profound  
reevaluation of how

Executive Director of Global Security
Developing Professionally-Sourced Intelligence  
(Pro-SINT) within OSINT  
 
As we confront these multifaceted threats, we may need to embrace a subtle distinction between  
Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and a subset that I call Professionally-Sourced Intelligence (Pro-SINT). 
What I unofficially refer to as “Pro-SINT” is distinct from a growing set of crowdsourced, hobbyist, and other 
unfiltered OSINT efforts using publicly-available information. Pro-SINT leverages more proprietary and  
commercially-available information and is marked by professional standards, oversight, privacy compliance, 
ability to collaborate with law enforcement entities, and most importantly a deep commitment to a set of 
international ethics that aligns with those of allied governments, regulated industries, and a scientific  
standard for verification and auditability.
The type of Professional OSINTer I’ve described, may reside in a government, a company, an NGO, or a  
university, but they all share a focus on deep-web data, Dark Web exploration, cyber-physical convergence, 
and sophisticated analysis, enriching traditional human observational intelligence methods and analytical 
judgment with the technologies required to provide nuanced insights at scale among the complex interplay 
of cyber and physical threats in real time. 
Professional OSINT is not only about enhancing defensive measures or reducing mean times to resolution of 
vulnerabilities, but about preemptively understanding and countering the strategic moves of adversaries,  
frequently seen in the chatter of encrypted communications preceding abrupt attacks or indicating  
persistent intrusion. Moreover, the integration of well-trained and auditable artificial intelligence and  
machine learning technologies into intelligence operations for commercially-available information offers  
unprecedented capabilities in detecting deepfakes and other sophisticated cyber threats, further enhancing 
our ability to anticipate and mitigate potential escalations in both cyber and kinetic domains, bolstering  
security postures for individual organizations, governments, and alliances.
A professional ethos is also essential to navigate the complexities introduced by decentralized platforms and 
Dark Web tools, which, while enabling resilience against censorship and protection from hostile surveillance 
in many parts of the world, also can pose challenges in distinguishing credible intelligence from  
misinformation in open societies.  
Challenges in Decentralized Communications 
and the Dark Web
A unique aspect of a hybrid digital evolution has been the role of decentralized communication platforms 
and the expanding use of Dark Web communications by both threat actors and friendly users with legitimate 
needs for protection and undetected attribution. 
These platforms have transcended their initial purposes to become digital command centers and  
sanctuaries for many unfiltered narratives. Their observed impact in facilitating real-time, unedited 
 information flows during the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza has been profound, underscoring the blurring  
lines between cyber, information, and kinetic warfare and highlighting the strategic significance of data in 
modern warfare.

Cross-platform, encrypted messaging, and Dark Web service platforms have also proved useful sources for 
key insights into the strategic, operational, and tactical context of challenges including proxy violence in the  
Middle East, tensions in the Taiwan Strait, hostile espionage activities against allies, in addition to the evolving 
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by cyber  
criminals for extortion or fraud. 
 
Strengthening collaboration among allies becomes crucial as we collectively counteract the threats posed by 
adversaries and protect shared economic interests and democratic values in cyberspace. However, achieving 
such unity in intelligence and security efforts presents its own set of challenges. Divergent political interests, 
varying levels of technological sophistication, and concerns over sovereignty and privacy can hinder the  
formation of a cohesive global threat picture for allies across public sector and private sector pillars.  
Recognizing these differences and ensuring an ability to appropriately tailor data collection and use for each 
individual client is paramount as we strive for a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to professional  
security intelligence.

Toward a Unified Approach to Global Security Intelligence 
The interwoven nature of ongoing wars, global conflicts, and the critical role of digital platforms in these  
dynamics underscore the imperative for comprehensive and forward-looking intelligence collaboration  
strategies. These strategies must not only address the immediate challenges posed by the current  
geopolitical and cyber threats but also anticipate the evolving nature of warfare
