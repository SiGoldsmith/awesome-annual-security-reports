In the ever\-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, 
this year’s Global Cybersecurity Outlook provides 
crucial insights into the multifaceted challenges 
facing leaders across the globe. Geopolitical 
instability, rapidly advancing technologies and an 
increasing gap in organizational cyber capabilities 
reinforce the need to build resilience and enable 
systemic global collaboration.

Building on the priorities outlined in last year’s 
report, the World Economic Forum’s Centre for 
Cybersecurity remains committed to bridging the 
gaps between the public and private sectors and 
between cyber and business leaders. The report 
serves as an instrument to distil cyber\-risk issues into 
achievable insights tailored to today’s executives.

While there is a notable sense of optimism 
stemming from increased executive\-level awareness 
of the cybersecurity ecosystem and its risks, the 
report also underscores a growing cyber divide. 

Organizations demonstrating cyber resilience 
are increasingly distinct from those grappling 
with cybersecurity challenges. The dialogue 
between cyber and business executives has 
shown improvement, yet significant disparities 
persist among industries, countries and sectors, 
demanding continued attention and collaboration.

Looking ahead to the challenges of 2024, the report 
illuminates major findings and puts a spotlight 
on the widening cyber inequity and the profound 
impact of emerging technologies. The path forward 
demands strategic thinking, concerted action and a 
steadfast commitment to cyber resilience.

This report invites leaders not only to recognize 
the hurdles but also to actively embrace the 
opportunities for positive change. It is a call for 
collective effort and innovation, urging leaders to 
work collaboratively towards a more secure, resilient 
and trustworthy digital future.

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024January 2024Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024Executive summary
Looming cyber inequity amid a rapidly evolving 
tech landscape emphasizes the need for even 
greater public\-private cooperation.

In 2023 the world faced a polarized geopolitical 
order, multiple armed conflicts, both scepticism and 
fervour about the implications of future technologies, 
and global economic uncertainty. Amid this complex 
landscape, the cybersecurity economy1 grew 
exponentially faster than the overall global economy, 
and outpaced growth in the tech sector.2 However, 
many organizations and countries experienced that 
growth in exceptionally different ways. 

A stark divide between cyber\-resilient organizations 
and those that are struggling has emerged. This 
clear divergence in cyber equity is exacerbated 
by the contours of the threat landscape, 
macroeconomic trends, industry regulation and early 
adoption of paradigm\-shifting technology by some 
organizations. Other clear barriers, including the 
rising cost of access to innovative cyber services, 
tools, skills and expertise, continue to influence 
the ability of the global ecosystem to build a more 
secure cyberspace in the face of myriad transitions. 

These factors are also ever\-present in the 
accelerated disappearance of a healthy “middle 
grouping” of organizations (i.e. those that maintain 
minimum standards of cyber resilience only). Despite 
this divide, many organizations indicate clear 
progress in certain aspects of their cyber capability. 
This year’s outlook also finds cause for optimism, 
especially when considering the relationship 
between cyber and business executives.

These are the major findings from this year’s Global 
Cybersecurity Outlook and the key cyber trends 
that executives will need to navigate in 2024:

There is growing cyber inequity 
between organizations that are 
cyber resilient and those that 
are not. 

In parallel, the population of organizations that 
maintain a minimum level of cyber resilience is 
disappearing. Small and medium enterprises 
(SMEs),3 despite making up the majority of many 
country’s ecosystems, are being disproportionately 
affected by this disparity.

remarkable gains in cyber resilience, SMEs 
showed a significant decline. 

 – More than twice as many SMEs as the largest 
organizations say they lack the cyber resilience 
to meet their critical operational requirements. 

 – 90% of the 120 executives surveyed at the 

World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting on 
Cybersecurity said that urgent action is required 
to address this growing cyber inequity. 

Emerging technology will 
exacerbate long\-standing 
challenges related to cyber 
resilience.

This will in turn accelerate the divide between the 
most capable and the least capable organizations. 

 – As organizations race to adopt new technologies, 
such as generative artificial intelligence (AI), a 
basic understanding is needed of the immediate, 
mid\-term and long\-term implications of these 
technologies for their cyber\-resilience posture. 

 –

Fewer than one in 10 respondents believe that 
in the next two years generative AI will give the 
advantage to defenders over attackers. 

 – Approximately half of executives say that 

advances in adversarial capabilities (phishing, 
malware, deepfakes) present the most 
concerning impact of generative AI on cyber.

The cyber\-skills and talent 
shortage continues to widen 
at an alarming rate.

 – Half of the smallest organizations by revenue 

say they either do not have or are unsure as to 
whether they have the skills they need to meet 
their cyber objectives. 

 – Only 15% of all organizations are optimistic 

that cyber skills and education will significantly 
improve in the next two years.

 – The number of organizations that maintain 

minimum viable cyber resilience is down 30%. 
While large organizations demonstrated 

 – 52% of public organizations state that a lack of 
resources and skills is their biggest challenge 
when designing for cyber resilience.

Cyber ecosystem risk is 
becoming more problematic.

Organizations (including both business and cyber

respondents that consider their organizations 
to be leaders and innovators in cyber resilience

cyber risk. Of organizations that are not cyber 
resilient, only 23% trust their CEO’s ability to

supply chain. Even 64% of executives who 
believe that their organization’s cyber resilience

they still have an inadequate understanding of 
their supply\-chain cyber vulnerabilities.

Understanding global 
cyber inequity
A systemic solution is needed to address 
the inequity in cyber\-resilience capacity 
across organizations and countries.

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 20241\.1 The state of cyber inequity 

In 2022, the cybersecurity economy5 grew 
twice as fast as the world economy.6 In 2023, it 
grew four times faster. Although organizational 
investment in cyber resilience overall is on the rise, 
rapid innovation and growth often lead to uneven 
development. 

This unevenness creates major economic and 
social benefits for some; generally, the largest and 
most developed economies reap the rewards of 
new technologies, while less developed nations, 
sectors and communities continue to fall behind. 
In this case, rapid technological growth, although 
benefiting many in terms of access, innovation and 
even collaboration, is also creating systemic inequity 
in the global cybersecurity economy and belies a 
pronounced disparity between the cyber\-resilience 
capability of organizations that make up its markets. 

The 2024 Global Cybersecurity Outlook (GCO) finds 
that organizations that maintain minimum viable 
cyber resilience – that is, a healthy middle grouping 
of organizations – are disappearing. Organizations 
reporting such a minimum viable cyber resilience 
are down 31% since 2022\. The distance between 
organizations that are cyber resilient enough to 
thrive and those that are fighting to survive is 
widening at an alarming rate. As a result, the least 
capable organizations are perpetually unable to 
keep up with the curve, falling further behind and 
threatening the integrity of the entire ecosystem. 
The cost of accessing adequate cyber services, 
tools and talent, and the early adoption of cutting\-
edge technology by the largest organizations in the 
ecosystem are two core factors driving the divide. 

A few statistics further illustrate the trend towards 
imbalance. The smallest organizations are more 
than twice as likely as the largest to say they 
lack the cyber resilience they need to meet their 
minimum critical operational requirements.7 At the 
other end of the spectrum, the highest\-revenue 
organizations are 22% more confident than the 
smallest organizations that their cyber resilience 

exceeds their operational needs. And yet the 
smallest\-revenue organizations are also a troubling 
three times more likely to lack the cyber skills they 
need to meet their cyber\-resilience objectives.

This phenomenon is particularly alarming in light of 
the interconnected nature of the cyber ecosystem. 
One of the core measurements of cyber resilience 
is an understanding of your ecosystem, inclusive of 
assessments of supply\-chain and third\-party risk. 
For those large organizations reporting that they are 
leaders in cyber resilience, the emergence of this 
drastic drop in cyber resilience of small organizations 
should be especially alarming. Consider a 2023 
report from SecurityScorecard and the Cyentia 
Institute, which found that “98% of organizations 
have a relationship with at least one third party that 
has experienced a breach in the last two years”.8 
This type of entanglement should be reason enough 
for those that are most cyber resilient to proactively 
help organizations in their ecosystem to move 
towards a healthier cyber posture. 

Several other factors may unduly influence and 
exacerbate the vulnerabilities of those SMEs in 
this widening disparity. Among small organizations 
– which are often unable to prevent critical 
operational disruption from an incident and can 
incur disproportionate financial loss to recover – 
only 25% carry cyber insurance. That’s three times 
less likely than the largest organizations by revenue, 
which report a 75% cyber\-insurance adoption rate. 
The results are also consistent for organization 
size by employee count. The more employees 
within an organization, the higher the adoption 
rate of cyber insurance; 85% of organizations 
with more than 100,000 employees carry cyber 
insurance, while only 21% of organizations with 250 
employees or fewer have a policy. As the prices of 
cyber insurance continue to rise exponentially, the 
expectation is that this gap will widen in parallel, 
leaving smaller organizations with even fewer 
options to reduce their risk.

Globally, disparity across geographies is also 
reflected in the analysis. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 
this global cyber gap tends to mirror other global 
development indicators. The lowest number of 
self\-reported cyber\-resilient organizations are 
in Latin America and Africa, while the highest 
number come from North America and Europe. 
Similarly, Latin America and Africa reported the 
highest number of insufficiently cyber\-resilient 
organizations, while North America and Europe 
reported the lowest number.

This phenomenon, sometimes characterized as 
the “cybersecurity poverty line (CPL)”, generally 
refers to the prohibitive cost of securing robust 
cybersecurity for an organization’s personnel, 
technology and systems. But this divide goes far 
beyond prohibitive costs. Consider the cyber\-
skills gap, a well\-documented issue for even the 
largest global organizations. Other factors, such as 
knowledgeable leaders, the ability to understand 
shifting best practices, and access to highly 
innovative technologies, also dramatically affect 
an organization’s ability to stay ahead of the curve. 
As the Atlantic Council puts it, “Cyber poverty 
exhibits dynamics very similar to real\-world poverty: 
simply providing money or free expertise does not 
necessarily address poor technological designs, 

poor market incentives, misaligned sociocultural 
attitudes towards security, or other barriers.”9

The disparity may be ultra\-visible now, but it has 
been developing for years, and the cyber\-resilience 
inequity trend has been steadily increasing over time. 
Among the lowest\-revenue organizations, lack of 
sufficient cyber resilience is up a troubling 32% since 
2022\. Among the highest\-revenue organizations, 
reported deficiencies in cyber resilience are similar to 
those reported two years ago. 

Additionally, the number of organizations with lower 
revenue that reported their cyber resilience exceeds 
their operational requirements has not increased 
over the past two years. Conversely, among large\-
revenue organizations, cyber confidence rose 32%.

Although there are generalized economic norms 
indicating that this is healthy competition, cyber 
leaders know that the digital ecosystem is so 
intertwined and fragile that to continue on this 
trajectory is more harmful than healthy.

When asked to comment on this disappearing 
middle grouping of organizations, Rotem Iram, 
Chief Executive Officer of At\-Bay, neatly summed it 
up in this way:

Security solutions are becoming too sophisticated, to the point 
where many SMEs struggle to operate them, let alone afford them.

10

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 20241\.2 Core drivers of cyber inequity

Organizations of all sizes and maturity levels 
have often struggled to maintain central tenets of 
organizational cyber resilience. Historically, however, 
several factors began to stratify the cyber capability 
of both public\- and private\-sector organizations. 
Some organizations prioritized resilience, 
incorporated it into corporate culture and invested 
accordingly, while others did not. Some sectors 
more strictly regulated their members – for example, 
out of concern for human safety or national security, 
to safeguard personally protected information, 
or to protect the global financial system. Other 
organizations were forced to contend with a more 
hostile threat landscape and suffered a significant, 
often public incident.

Over time, differences in organizational, sectoral and 
country\-specific circumstances, as well as varied 
responses to universal cyber challenges, separated 
the market into clear leaders and stragglers. Add to 
the equation the pace of the rising cost of access to 
adequate cybersecurity capability and what results 

is the current state of cyber inequity between small 
and large organizations, between the public and 
private sectors, and among organizations operating 
in different economies around the world. 

The digital divide in access to the internet provides 
a useful parallel. Consider the comment from Angel 
Gonzalez Sanz, Head of Science, Technology and 
Innovation in the Division on Technology and Logistics 
of the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
Development (UNCTAD), that, “although 63% of 
the world’s population is connected to the internet; 
least developed countries still only count 27% of 
their populations as internet users”.10 The digital 
ecosystem is so highly interconnected and influenced 
by geopolitics, economics and the rapid emergence 
of new technology that no entity can afford to be 
perpetually trapped under the capability curve, least of 
all the organizations that are already the most at risk. 

As Abhay Raman, Senior Vice\-President and Chief 
Security Officer at Sun Life, put it:

Affordability is a critical determinant of cyber\-resilience success. 
We should therefore design risk\-appropriate, affordable and 
fit\-for\-use cyber\-resilience architectures for large multinationals 
and SMEs alike.

The risks associated with continuing to 
exacerbate this technological divide between 
organizations and nations that can and cannot 
adequately mitigate cyber events poses both 
a threat to the entire ecosystem and outsized 
risks to those that are already vulnerable. The 
imbalance in global internet access presents 
a prescient example of the consequences of 
sustaining an unequal digital ecosystem.

Doing so requires a systemic solution, with 
participation from everyone – SMEs, multinational 
corporations (MNCs), non\-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and governmental 

organizations. Fortunately, cyber executives 
agree: 90% of the 120 executives surveyed at 
the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting on 
Cybersecurity said that urgent action is required 
to address this growing cyber inequity. There is 
evidence of an appetite for systemic collaboration 
that supports SMEs. For example, in 2020, the 
World Economic Forum brought together partners 
from telecommunication companies, civil society 
and cyber organizations to publish cybercrime 
prevention principles for internet services providers. 
This is an example of systemically important actors 
such as internet service providers working to protect 
the entire ecosystem, including smaller players.11

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 20242\.1 Geopolitical tensions and cyber
2\.1 Geopolitical tensions and cyber

Geopolitics has 
at least moderately 
influenced

70%

of organizations’ 
cybersecurity 
strategies.

In this year’s Global Cybersecurity Outlook survey, 
70% of leaders stated that geopolitics has at 
least moderately influenced their organization’s 
cybersecurity strategy. The influence of geopolitics 
has remained as persistently top of mind as it was 
last year, with 74% of respondents from the 2023 
report stating the same. This year, 32% of 37 CISOs 
surveyed separately said they are adjusting their 
cybersecurity strategy by increasing the use of 
threat intelligence reports and further developing 
their incident response plans. Increasingly alarming 
attacks against critical infrastructure, and elements 
in global supply chains, coupled with economic 
instability, have the potential to cause macro\-impact. 

Geopolitics also directly influences how quickly 
the risk landscape can shift for an organization 
or country. Some 72% of leaders report that they 
understand this rapidly shifting landscape and are 
actively integrating current events into how they 
manage their cyber risks. 

Just as cybersecurity breaches weaken our faith in 
the systems that underpin economies and societies, 
other technological risks, such as disinformation, 
can do the same. Often the same defenders are 
called upon to help combat both. A key example of 
this is how public\- and private\-sector organizations 
alike are reevaluating both the vulnerabilities 
of specific institutions and processes, such as 
elections, in the face of intense geopolitical strife, 
and increased technological capability. 

An example of the intersection of geopolitical 
turmoil and artificial intelligence, deepfakes 
and sophisticated phishing campaigns have 
the potential to become weaponized to disrupt 
democratic election procedures. Although 
information warfare is not a new concept, the 
decentralization of information sources, and the 
rapid advance of technology, makes defending 
against these types of malicious threats a key 
concern in the coming year and beyond. 

Looking ahead to 2024, these risks will compound 
to take centre stage. More than 45 countries will 
hold elections over the next year to determine 
who governs more than 50% of the world’s GDP.12 
With the proliferation of new technologies such as 
generative AI and their use by cyber adversaries 
becoming more widespread, safeguarding the 
integrity and fairness of the electoral process 
becomes of paramount importance.

In Slovakia’s September 2023 elections, for instance, 
a deepfake audio clip was released that purported to 
show a candidate discussing how to manipulate the 
election with a media representative.13

Artificial intelligence advances pose more risks than 
deepfakes or misinformation. To understand the 
intersection of cyber and election security,14 there 
are six areas of risk that should be noted as next 
year’s elections unfold.

 – Misinformation and disinformation: organized 
campaigns spreading misinformation through 
social media or other channels can influence 
public opinion, cast doubt on election integrity 
and sway election outcomes.

 – Deepfakes: in this specific species of 

disinformation, AI\-generated deepfake videos 
or audio recordings can be used to spread false 
information about candidates or manipulate 
public perception.

 – Automated disinformation: AI algorithms can 
be employed to generate and spread large 
volumes of disinformation, making it harder to 
detect and combat.

 – Targeted advertising: AI\-driven microtargeting 
of mis\- or disinformation of voters through 
personalized advertisements can be used to 
manipulate opinions or suppress voter turnout.

 – Data privacy concerns: where voting 

information is drawn from national ID, residence 
records or other methods that connect 
to personally identifiable information (PII), 
automated processing may create avenues for 
the leakage of personal data not relevant to 
voting eligibility determinations.

 – Algorithmic manipulation of social media: 
AI algorithms on social media platforms can 
be manipulated to amplify certain political 
messages or suppress others, influencing 
public opinion.

It is worth noting that while generative AI will add to 
the complexity of attacks, it is not the only concern 
in relation to the rise in cybercriminal activity due 
to geopolitical tensions. Over the past five years, 
the number of malware families15 and variants that 
have infiltrated at least 10% of global organizations 
has doubled.16 

Cyberthreats to the electoral process are just 
one example of how the confluence of emerging 
tech, cyber and geopolitics might demand global 
attention in the coming year. A collaborative 
approach ensures a multipronged defence strategy, 
fortifying the overall resilience of election systems 
against a diverse spectrum of cyberthreats.

13

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 20242\.2 New technology, same fear

Emerging technology is becoming available more 
widely and far faster than in the past. This rapid 
uptake of technologies has outpaced the ability 
of civil society, regulators and organizations to 
truly implement safety and security principles. 
Furthermore, to responsibly implement leading\-edge 
technology, it is critical to reinforce the underlying 
systems required to support it. Otherwise, 
organizations will likely allow deficits in fundamental 
security, resilience and trust to be exacerbated. 

The 2024 Global Cyber Outlook findings indicate 
that organizations are paying attention and reacting 
quickly to mitigate the risks of adopting emerging 
technology. The meteoric rise of large language 
models (LLMs) and generative AI over the past 
12 months is a key example. Although quantum 
technologies may be temporary eclipsed by the zeal 
surrounding generative AI, it is still on the minds 

of respondents as a matter to be addressed. In 
one way, quantum is making its way back to the 
forefront; in November 2023, the United States was 
working to instate the National Quantum Initiative 
Reauthorization Act.17

In the 2022 Global Cybersecurity Outlook,18 
approximately half of leaders said that automation 
and machine learning would have the greatest 
influence on cybersecurity in the following two years. 
Nearly two years later, executives still feel the same – 
this year, approximately half of leaders still agree that 
generative AI will have the most significant impact on 
cybersecurity in the next two years. Industries such 
as cybersecurity (65%), agriculture (63%), banking 
(56%) and insurance (56%) all had the largest 
percentages of leaders choosing generative AI as 
the biggest influence on cybersecurity.

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024Leaders also express concerns about the impact 
on cybersecurity in the near term. This year, 56% 
of leaders said that generative AI will advantage 
cyberattackers over defenders in the next two years. 
More specifically, their greatest concern about 
generative AI is that it will advance the adversary’s 

ability to undertake actions that defenders are 
already fighting against such as phishing, developing 
custom malware and propagating misinformation.

As Kris Burkhardt, Global Chief Information Security 
Officer from Accenture, stated:

We must strengthen our defences across the board, and the 
same can be true for any emerging technology. A lot of the attack 
vectors seem to be the same, they just tend to be amplified.

The same attack vectors that have been employed 
by cybercriminals are still being used; however, new 
technology paves the way for nefarious activity. 
Generative AI chatbots are making it much easier for 
cybercriminals to create believable phishing emails and 
write custom malware. Although popular commercial 

chatbots have built\-in censors and proactive controls 
to prevent abuse, cybercriminals are adopting large 
language models to design malicious subscription\-
based services. Chatbots such as FraudGPT and 
WormGPT are lowering the skills required to commit 
complex and convincing campaigns.19

AI used to create convincing deepfake

In August 2023, a software company fell victim to 
one of the most advanced and complicated social 
engineering attacks, which used AI to create a 
deepfake audio of an employee. The company was 
first targeted through a well\-timed and targeted 
smishing campaign that was themed around open 
enrolment for health insurance. One employee 
clicked on the link in the text message and provided 
their credentials to the fake system. Immediately 
after the attacker received the credentials, they 
called the employee’s phone to retrieve the 
multifactor authentication (MFA) code.20

These actions raised suspicion from the employee, 
but because the attacker using a deepfake audio 
of a familiar colleague, the employee ignored the 
red flags and provided their MFA code to the 
attacker. Between the credentials and the MFA 
code, the attacker was able to add their personal 
device to the employee’s Okta account (Okta is 
an identity cloud that links all apps, logins and 
devices). This allowed the attacker to gain approval 
from the authentication systems used by the victim 
organization.21 Although direct attribution to a 
malicious chatbot may be difficult, organizations 
can expect even more of these complex and 
convincing phishing, vishing and smishing attacks.22

 The tedious 

job of data 
classification can 
be made less of 
a manual chore 
with the help of 
generative AI.

For most organizations, the potential upside of 
implementing leading\-edge technologies such as 
generative AI or the metaverse is vast. Generative 
AI is predicted to increase global GDP by 7% 
over a 10\-year period.23 Organizations around the 
globe are able to use the metaverse as a safe, 
effective and low\-cost way to educate and train 
people.24 However, the speed and scale at which 
technology is entering the ecosystem is deepening 
executives’ concerns and stressing the underlying 
technology systems in their organizations. 

When 120 leaders at the World Economic 
Forum’s Annual Meeting on Cybersecurity were 
asked whether evaluating the impact of emerging 
technology risk on the broader organization or 
better covering cybersecurity fundamentals and 
addressing existing gaps should be the bigger 
priority for their board or most senior leadership 
in the upcoming year, almost three\-quarters 
(73%) stressed the importance of cybersecurity 
fundamentals and addressing existing gaps. 

Leading\-edge technology itself could also 
be part of the solution. Applying emerging 
technologies to foundational security elements 
is a powerful opportunity to help alleviate the 
reliability and availability challenges with which 
many organizations have struggled for years. 

A prime example of this is the improvement of the 
software development life cycle (SDLC). Prompts 
to an LLM can be used as a method of ensuring 
that requirements, design guidelines or software 
architecture are all coded and implemented as 
planned in the software.25 The LLM can evaluate 
and review the code with precision and speed 
and serve as a way to test the code for errors or 
scan for vulnerabilities before release. Software 
engineers can partner with LLMs to work towards 
developing more complete, secure code, eliminating 
some of the human\-error aspects of the SDLC. 

To take this a step further, LLMs can be 
used to help translate software developed in 
deprecated or obsolete code into a current, 
more secure language. Setting aside concerns 
about propriety code being leaked, all of 
the above use cases would vastly benefit 
the security of open\-source software.

The SDLC is not the only area to benefit from 
LLMs. The tedious job of data classification can 
be made less of a manual chore with the help 
of generative AI. Many of the large software 
organizations are creating tools that will enable 
an organization to automate the process of 
ensuring data is classified and marked in line 
with organizational policy. When 13% of leaders 
state that employees were the reason behind 
a material incident in the past 12 months, data 
labelling and marking becomes imperative. 

Applying and using LLMs in a security operations 
centre (SOC) is another way to adopt emerging 
technology into existing foundational cybersecurity. 
LLMs can be used as a way of automating or 
assisting an analyst to threat\-hunt with more 
accuracy or develop less noisy and higher\-
fidelity rules. In fact, according to Splunk’s The 
CISO Report, 27% of surveyed chief information 
security officers (CISOs) will use generative 
AI in their SOCs to do just that – provide 
data enrichment of alerts and incidents.26

These three examples are only illustrations of 
how generative AI can be used to alleviate some 
of the issues with established cybersecurity 
challenges; however, it cannot solve all of them. 
In its current state, it will not be able to fully 
replace skills that are grounded in creativity 
or human judgement nor require nuanced 
communication decisions, which include roles 
such as information security analysts.27

In the thick of the 
cyber\-skills shortage
Creative action is needed to address 
the growing cyber\-skills gap.

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 20243\.1 The skills gap

Executives know that in an evolving cybersecurity 
landscape, with economic uncertainties, attracting 
and retaining cybersecurity talent is a crucial 
aspect of organizational success. The supply of 
emerging technology entering the digital ecosystem 
will continue to significantly intensify the demand 
for skilled professionals. Yet the pool of available 
professionals is already too small and the pipeline 
of rising talent is woefully dry. Year on year, more 
organizations lack the right number of people with the 
right skills to meet their cyber\-resilience objectives.

In 2022, 6% of leaders reported that they were 
missing the skills and people they needed to 
respond to a cyber incident. In 2023, this doubled 
to 12%. This year, when asked whether their 
organization has the skills it needs to accomplish its 
cyber objectives, 20% said that they do not. Leaders 
who are unsure if they have the required skill sets 
also rose from 4% in 2022 to 11% this year.

This shortage is not related solely to having the 
resources to perform specific tasks; a lack of 
critical technical and soft skills is quickly becoming 
the largest barrier preventing an organization from 
achieving its strategic cyber\-resilience objectives. 
This year, 36% of respondents said that skills 
gaps are the main challenge to achieving their 
cyber\-resilience goals. Some 78% of respondents 
reported that their organizations do not have the 
in\-house skills to fully achieve their cybersecurity 
objectives. This is worsened when factoring in that 
57% of respondents from an ISC2 cybersecurity 
workforce study28 believe that the shortage 
of cybersecurity staff is putting organizations 
in moderate to extreme risk of experiencing a 
cybersecurity attack.29

In a concerning indication of inequity, 31% of 
leaders from the smallest organizations by revenue 
reported that they are missing critical people and 

skills; yet only 11% of leaders from the largest 
organizations said the same. This aligns with 
34% of respondents from the ISC2 cybersecurity 
workforce study, who indicated that the most 
important cause of a cybersecurity staff shortage 
is their organization not having the budget.30 Even 
if they could get access to enough people, they 
cannot compete for the right talent. While the 
skills gap is affecting all organizations, the smallest 
organizations are facing the greatest challenge. 

To fill these gaps, organizations are looking 
internally. Although many employers are still looking 
to hire experienced cybersecurity professionals 
(33%), the number one way in which organizations 
are filling these roles is by upskilling existing 
employees (41%). In fact, to upskill the workforce, 
as many as 91% of organizations are willing to pay 
for cybersecurity training and certification for their 
employees.31 The motivation to upskill can also be 

18

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024observed from the side of professionals. Research 
shows that more than 70% of employees would 
consider returning to college to pursue a degree 
or certificate that would allow them to work in 
cybersecurity if their employers provided funding.32 
Although non\-traditional recruitment paths are a 
promising way to ensure an organization has the 
skills it needs, few leaders are choosing it. 

Microcredentials – certifications or short educational 
courses, rather than traditional university degrees 
– are one way to fill skills gaps and open up a new 
pipeline of talent for organizations.33 However, 
considering that the majority of cybersecurity 
roles and positions today still require a university 
degree, it comes as no surprise that only 9% of 
organizations report taking advantage of that 
pipeline by recruiting outside of traditional cyber 
degrees or credentials.34 Apprentice programmes 
are an even less tapped opportunity for talent; only 
8% of organizations use these programmes to 
close the skills gap. Without intervention, this gap 
will continue to widen unopposed. 

Another rift between the smallest and largest 
organizations by revenue is the ability to recruit 
traditional cybersecurity professionals. Only 21% 
of respondents from the smallest organizations by 
revenue said they would close the skills gap by 

recruiting experienced cyber professionals; 
in comparison, 36% respondents from the largest 
organizations by revenue said the same.

The smallest organizations by revenue also 
place more pressure on employees to upskill 
independently. Although 15% of respondents from 
these organizations expect their employees to 
upskill independently, only 4% of the respondents 
from the largest organizations by revenue said 
the same. The burden then falls to the smallest 
organizations by revenue to find creative solutions 
to secure the resources needed to respond and 
recover from a cyber incident. The cyber skills 
shortage continues to widen and uncertainty grows 
surrounding the securing of resources. 

To tackle the shortage of cybersecurity skills and 
talent, and raise awareness among decision\-makers 
about the implications of the cybersecurity skills 
deficit for the global economy and security, the 
World Economic Forum’s Centre for Cybersecurity 
has established the Bridging the Cyber Skills Gap 
initiative. Taking a multistakeholder approach and 
using diverse perspectives from industry leaders, 
government agencies, civil society and academia, the 
initiative aims to create a strategic cybersecurity talent 
framework and devise actions to help individuals 
enter and thrive in the cybersecurity workforce.

World Economic Forum research indicates that by 2027, 44% of 
workers’ core skills will be disrupted because technology is moving 
faster than companies can design and scale their training. This is 
true in cybersecurity, where the talent gap continues to pose very 
real challenges across public and private industries. To address 
this, organizations must tap into new talent pools – beyond 
‘traditional’ candidates with previous cyber experience – and 
provide employees with upskilling opportunities like certification 
programmes. These hiring and retention strategies can help 
organizations keep pace with the evolving threat landscape.

reported that their greatest concern was suffering 
direct financial losses, such as from a ransomware 
attack. The most chosen answer by leaders from the 
Middle East was brand and reputation damage. 

Similar to the overarching concern about 
operational disruption, when leaders were asked 
what personally keeps them up at night, they said 

that losing access to important goods and services 
and cyber extortion are the most concerning. The 
concerns about disruption are not unfounded when 
considering that 29% of leaders stated that their 
organization had experienced a material impact 
from a cyberattack in the past 12 months.

Regionally, more than half of leaders from Europe 
and North America reported that their organization 
carries cyber insurance. More than 60% of 
leaders from all other regions reported that their 
organizations do not carrier cyber insurance.

In September 2023, a global gaming and 
entertainment company was brought face to face 
with its worst fears. A social engineering attack, 
which took place during a 10\-minute phone call 
to the organization’s help desk, sparked a 10\-
day critical disruption.36 Stronger cybersecurity 
foundations, with a focus on awareness, education 
and more robust incident response plans, could 
have mitigated the resulting disruption to the 
organization. This event occurred without the 
confirmed use of generative AI, which further 
stresses that the foundational cybersecurity 
elements need to be put in place and mastered to 
contend with the potential rise in advanced attacks 
from new capabilities. 

Organizations need to focus not only on the 
emerging and new but also on older technology 
or legacy systems. For the largest organizations 

by revenue, 44% of survey respondents said that 
securing legacy technology is their highest barrier 
to cyber resilience. For them, it is an even greater 
challenge than gaining enough executive support 
or filling skills gaps. During several workshops 
convened for this report, discussions on resilience 
focused heavily on the importance of operational 
technology security. Legacy systems were most 
pronounced in organizations with an operational 
technology (OT) footprint.37

This issue becomes more apparent when looking at 
how responses differ between cyber and business 
leaders. Following on from the fact that the gap 
between cyber and business leaders is closing, 
the main conclusion of the GCO 2023 report, both 
groups said that resource or skills gaps were the 
highest barrier to cyber resilience (38% of business 
leaders and 32% of cyber leaders).

For security leaders, securing legacy technology 
(29%) and cultural resistance to change (25%) 
followed close behind. Interestingly, this is where 
business leaders’ paths diverged, with only 14% 
and 8% respectively agreeing with security leaders 
on these challenges. 

Both securing legacy technology and a cultural 
resistance to change stem from issues with 
resources and skills gaps. It appears that in the 
view of security leaders, these challenges cannot be 
addressed until they have the people and skills with 
which to address them. For business leaders, these 
challenges are more tenable, as their work is not 
immersed in the day\-to\-day tasks of designing for 
cyber resilience. 

The barrier will become even higher as 
organizations rush to adopt generative AI and other 
elements of emerging technology. However, most 
organizations either do not upgrade older systems 
or do so much more slowly than the speed at which 
they introduce more tools and new technologies. 
This in turn expands their technological footprint 
and adds risk. 

What is more, larger organizations weighed down 
by a greater and older technology burden will 
be less able to assist and monitor the smallest 
organizations in their supply chain. This would 
strain support mechanisms in the ecosystem 
and exacerbate the inequalities discussed in the 
previous section. As Janus Friis Bindslev, Chief 
Digital Risk Officer of PensionDanmark, put it: 

Sometimes you call it legacy, but previous issues with underlying 
technologies and complexity that larger companies typically carry 
around will be more apparent with the new innovations we’re 
seeing. There wasn’t such a rush to solve those issues before, 
but now those issues will be amplified.

23

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024 
4\.2 Emerging technologies and the state of resilience

Cyber resilience is built step by step through 
prudent planning and long\-term commitment to 
organizational change. Security leaders are always 
at risk of being distracted from their core work by 
hype about instant solutions, the need to focus on 
the secure implementation of new technologies 
or the tension created by a well\-grounded fear 
of imminent attacks. Despite the noise, the 
organizations surveyed show that a degree of 
strategic patience and prudent cyber\-resilience 
practices are slowly but surely having an impact.

The accelerated adoption of emerging technologies 
does, of course, create new security challenges. 
However, many of the security leaders involved in 

this study argued that maintaining a focus on tried 
and tested cyber\-resilience practices will help detect 
and mitigate risks early.38 These principles are 
exemplified by the corresponding responses from 
cyber\-resilient organizations. Critically, the number 
of leaders who report that they are confident in their 
organization’s cyber resilience has risen steadily 
year on year for the past three years and is up 20% 
from 2022\.

Driving this confidence is the emphasis 
organizations are placing on integrating 
cybersecurity into their enterprise risk, gaining 
executive leadership buy\-in and shifting the 
organizational culture. 

4\.3 Cybercrime and the state of resilience

In this year’s Outlook report, the vast majority of 
leaders (81%) responded that they feel more exposed 
or similarly exposed to cybercrime than last year. 
This is despite Fortinet’s annual threat report finding 
a 75% drop in exploitation attempts per organization. 
They note that while this may initially seem hopeful, it 
is more likely a combination of improvements in the 
ability of defenders to detect attacks, and better and 
more precise targeting from cyber criminals.39 

Exposure to cybercrime does not always need 
to directly correlate with the number of attacks. 

Workshops with security leaders undertaken at 
the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting 
on Cybersecurity in late 2023 suggest that as 
cybercriminals gain access to new technologies 
that increase the speed and level of tailoring of their 
attacks, security leaders will continue to benefit 
from focusing on cyber\-resilience essentials. This 
includes maintaining leadership support, integrating 
cyber into enterprise risk management and 
continuing to capitalize on the cultural and structural 
changes organizations need to make to adapt to 
new technologies.

24

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 20244\.4 Business leadership and the state of resilience

In 2023’s Outlook report, security executives 
expressed increased concern about the level of 
cyber resilience in their business. In parallel, the level 
of awareness of cyber risk and cybercrime among 
business executives led to a marked increase in 
concern about the ability of their organizations to 
be cyber resilient. This might be due to business 
leaders’ better understanding of the damage that 
a major cyberattack could do to their operations, 
commercial relationships and reputation.

Cyber resilience and CEO trust are tightly 
connected. This year, a resounding 93% of the 
respondents that consider their organizations 
to be leaders and innovators in cyber resilience 
trust their CEO to speak externally about their 
cyber risk. None of the security leaders from the 
group of organizations that self\-reported as cyber 
resilient said they distrust their CEO to speak 
externally about the state of cyber resilience in 
their organization.

Perception of cyber resilience

High

Of the respondents reporting that their 
organizations are not cyber resilient, 77% either 
distrust or are unsure about their CEO’s ability to 
speak about their cyber risk. 

This suggests that organizations in which executive 
leadership is engaged in how cyber risk is managed 
are more cyber resilient. A security leader’s trust in 
their CEO’s ability to talk to external partners about 
cyber resilience is a proxy measurement for how 
engaged the C\-suite is in the management of cyber 
risk. Firms that report high levels of trust in their 
CEO to articulate the organization’s cyber\-resilience 
posture also self\-report as being more cyber resilient.

CEOs are more aware of their organization’s 
cyber risk than ever before. Some 74% of CEOs 
are concerned about their organization’s ability to 
avert or minimize damage to the business from a 
cyberattack40, according to Accenture’s The Cyber\-

Resilient CEO report. Executive leadership is using 
cyber incidents (29%) and reports and statistics 
(24%) to educate and influence their decisions 
regarding cybersecurity. This suggests that a 
significant minority of organizational leaders are 
professionalizing their approach to cybersecurity 
decision\-making by bringing in sources that were 
previously reserved for security leaders or subject\-
matter experts.

Building upon the importance of an enterprise\-wide 
approach to cyber resilience is the integration of 
such an approach into enterprise risk management. 
Some 78% of respondents who are confident in their 
organization’s cyber resilience also report that cyber 
resilience has been integrated into their enterprise 
risk management. The alignment between cyber and 
business leaders can also be seen here: 65% of cyber 
leaders and 57% of business leaders report that cyber 
resilience is integrated into their risk management.

Public organizations are taking action,

In November 2023, the federal government of 
Australia announced an AUD 18\-million deal to uplift 
their country’s SMEs’ ability to react and respond 
to cyber incidents. SMEs form 97% of businesses 
in Australia, and the package will assist them in a 
variety of fundamental cyber\-resilience practices 
including education materials, requirements on how 
to upskill, cyber\-maturity assessments and guidance 
on how to better respond to cyber incidents.41

actively partner with the private sector to uplift its 
cybersecurity posture – the European Union is also 
focusing attention on the cybersecurity positioning 
of its private organizations. The European 
Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC) is 
an EU initiative to build a stronger cybersecurity 
posture through a new framework, research and 
information sharing.42

The ECCC has hosted information\-sharing events 
to strengthen the collective cyber resilience of 
its participating countries. The first such event 

took place in November 2023, and focused on 
cybersecurity awareness.43 Participating countries, 
such as Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, 
Italy, Germany and Estonia, were able to share 
their lessons learned and best practices on how to 
promote effective cyber awareness, not just with 
business, but with the workforce and 
general population.

However, one critical governance issue, which is 
also at the heart of trust in the digital ecosystem, 
still needs to be addressed. There is a glaring 
imbalance of responsibility for security between 
technology producers and technology consumers. 
For years, organizations and individuals have had 
the primary responsibility for ensuring the hardware 
and software they use is securely and resiliently 
implemented, operated and maintained. When 
incidents do happen, the burden of remediating 
and recovering from it similarly resides with the 
user, along with the associated financial burden. 
This situation is indicative of the technology and 
cybersecurity industry’s expansive growth over the 
past two decades, its relative immaturity compared 
to more established sectors of consumer goods 
and the associated growing pains as it matures. 

B O X 3

Focus on the CISO

Chief information security officers (CISOs) believe 
that addressing the balance of liability for cyber 
incidents is getting ever more urgent. At one 
World Economic Forum session at the Annual 
Meeting on Cybersecurity in November 2023, 
approximately 50 participants from all regions of 
the world discussed this topic at length. Some 
security leaders argued that liability and regulation 
can work directly against practices important for 
protecting the wider ecosystem, such as cross\-
industry collaboration and information sharing 
during live attacks. 

In general, public\-sector organizations have been 
asking security leaders to share more information 
on incidents and to do so at speed. This naturally 
requires a trade\-off on accuracy as it takes time 
to understand the full scope and impact of a 
cyber incident. At the same time, security leaders 
feel they will be penalized for providing incorrect 
information. 

In 2022 the focus of regulators and public 
agencies was on the role of the board in managing 
cybersecurity risk. In 2023, however, scrutiny has 
expanded to include security leaders. 

Many security executives are now held personally 
accountable for the state of their organization’s 

cybersecurity – which comes to light only after an 
incident. Discussions are taking place globally on 
a range of CISO liability\-related behaviours, from 
intentional malicious behaviour to negligence. In 
fact, in May 2023, former Uber CISO, Joseph 
Sullivan, was fined and sentenced to three years’ 
probation after being the first cybersecurity 
executive to be convicted of covering up 
elements of a data breach perpetrated by external 
attackers.44 Six months later, former SolarWinds 
CISO, Timothy Brown, was charged with securities 
fraud by allegedly overstating SolarWind’s 
cybersecurity practices and allegedly understating 
or failing to disclose known cybersecurity risks 
prior to the company’s breach in 2020, which had 
a systemic impact across several jurisdictions.45 

The cases taken against Uber and SolarWinds 
are tackling highly undesirable behaviours, but 
an unintended consequence is the creation of an 
atmosphere of legal risk that could raise additional 
obstacles for security leaders who wish to improve 
systemic cyber resilience by, for example, sharing 
information with their peers during an ongoing 
attack. Public\-sector agencies might reduce some 
of the unintended negative consequences of their 
actions by providing security leaders with clearer 
guidance on what is expected of them during 
events such as live cyber incidents.

28

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024This is a contentious topic that has spawned a 
nuanced debate. This year’s surveys, interviews 
and workshops indicated a consensus towards 
a balance of responsibilities. The most frequently 
encountered view is that it is not sustainable to 
simply shift all responsibility to the technology 
companies – the consumer must continue to play 
an appropriate part in maintaining cyber trust. 

business acceleration and fear of being left 
behind tempts organizations into introducing 
new technology into their environment much 
faster and with less fundamental security than is 
prudent. Cyber leaders understand that a core 
part of the solution is a fundamental shift in the 
economic incentive structure for those innovating in 
technology and cyberspace.

Feedback from expert interviews and workshops 
run to support this report suggest that the 
combination of convenience, prospects for 

Michael Daniel, President and Chief Executive 
Officer of the Cyber Threat Alliance, characterized 
the situation in this way: 

As an industry we have pushed cybersecurity responsibility all the 
way out to the edge, which isn’t very efficient. But if you’re going 
to realign the burden toward secure by design, you also have to 
change the incentive structure for the technology providers to 
create upside for them.

Nonetheless, notable efforts are under way in both 
governmental programmes and private\-sector 
initiatives to spread the responsibility for security 
by design more evenly. The United States National 
Cybersecurity Strategy and US Cybersecurity 
Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA)’s 
“Secure by Design, Secure by Default” campaign 
are prominent examples. The European Union’s 
proposed Cyber Resilience Act is another high\-
profile effort. 

Both of the above examples strongly advocate 
making technology manufacturers and service 
providers more responsible for ensuring that 
their products were created with security from 
the beginning and that they can be kept secure 

throughout their life cycle. These efforts also aim 
to clarify for everyday consumers which products 
they can trust. 

Organizations are working to build trust in 
leadership and emphasize the importance of cyber 
resilience enterprise\-wide. In addition to this, there 
is growing cooperation between the public and 
private sectors to uplift organizations that do not 
have the resources on their own to achieve that 
same level of resilience, as well as efforts to make 
products more secure out of the box and for the 
duration of their usage. These factors work together 
to smooth out disparity among organizations with 
different demographics, and increase the capability 
of the ecosystem, benefiting all.

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 20245

Building a better 
cyber ecosystem
Collaboration among organizations, 
suppliers, insurers and regulatory bodies 
is an essential factor for building a more 
secure cyber environment.

30

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024Key indicators for systemic cyber resilience include 
the quantity and quality of industry collaborations, 
the effectiveness and clarity of regulations, the 
maturity and accessibility of the cyber insurance 
market, and the extent to which organizations 
understand cyber risk coming from their own supply 
chains and third\-party relationships.

When an organization finds common ground 
in its relationship with its suppliers, regulators, 
government agencies and industry peers, it creates 
a more resilient digital landscape. Conversely, an 
organization cannot truly be resilient if the partners 
on whom it relies are fragile. 

5\.1 Are cyber collaborations stalling or continuing 

to mature?

Unfortunately, only 23% of leaders are optimistic 
that industry and ecosystem collaboration will 
significantly improve in the next two years. Cyber 
leaders are marginally more optimistic that industry 
and ecosystem collaboration will become better 
(29%) in comparison to business leaders (17%). 
This could be because cyber leaders have more 
direct access to these collaborations and can see 
how they are growing in operational maturity. 

This year’s outlook shows that partners in an 
organization’s ecosystem – each with their own 
perspectives and incentives – are both the greatest 
asset and the biggest hindrance to a secure, 
resilient and trustworthy digital future.

5\.2 Effective regulation lifts all boats

Executive views on cyber regulation are a good 
example of the evolution of the perspective of 
both business and cyber leaders on public private 
interaction over the years. On the one hand, 60% 
of leaders from private organizations feel that cyber 

and privacy regulation effectively reduces risk in 
their organization’s ecosystem, up from 39% in 
2022\. They are aligned with public leaders – 65% 
also agree with the statement.

ecosystem, 34% of those leaders say their biggest 
challenge is that there are too many conflicting 
regulations across countries. However, only 7% say 

that regulations are technically too hard to meet. 
Not only is regulation valuable, but greater alignment 
across industries and geographies would make 
cyber and privacy regulation even more beneficial. 

B O X 4

The SCRE initiative

The World Economic Forum Systems of Cyber 
Resilience: Electricity (SCRE) Initiative works 
towards tackling the challenges of fragmented 
and conflicting regulations. The SCRE community 
has recently provided a “Response to the White 
House’s Request on Harmonizing Cybersecurity 
Regulations”46 and in the past at the request of the 
European Commission also offered a response 

to the Commission’s cybersecurity package, 
“Commentary in the Light of Recent Sophisticated 
Supply Chain Attacks”.47 The SCRE community 
has also put together a position paper, “Facilitating 
Global Interoperability of Cyber Regulations in 
the Electricity Sector”,48 to support regulators to 
build a more secure, resilient and standardized 
approach to cyber regulations globally.

5\.3 The role of insurance

Similar to the role of regulatory bodies, the 
insurance industry is also instrumental in mitigating 
and containing risks throughout the ecosystem. 
Cyber insurance is a valuable tool for defraying 
the financial harm inevitable in any cyber\-resilience 
strategy, and in many cases provides crucial 
support in ensuring sufficient and effective 
investment in cybersecurity. Yet the number of 

organizations that hold a cyber\-insurance policy has 
dropped by 24% overall since 2022, with feedback 
from expert workshops in 2023 suggesting 
that, even for larger organizations, insurance is 
sometimes not economically viable and that security 
budgets can be more usefully spent elsewhere. 
The causes of this disparity become obvious when 
viewed through the lens of revenue.

32

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024There have been calls for greater transparency in 
the insurance industry, especially when it comes 
to methods of rate\-setting and incentivizing 
cyber behaviours through reduced premiums. 
Collaboration both within the industry and with 
civil\-society counterparts will be needed to address 
skyrocketing costs. Either way, collaboration 

between the industry’s policy consumers and its 
providers to increase ecosystem resilience would 
benefit the market and contribute to the baseline 
cyber\-resilience capability in these ecosystems.

As Davis Hake, the Co\-Founder and Vice\-President 
of Policy at Resilience Insurance, stated: 

If insurance can transform more into a risk management solution, 
you’re going to see cyber insurance as a driver for not only 
incentivizing companies to be safer, but as something that every 
company that wants to address this risk needs to have.

5\.4 Understanding cyber resilience in the supply chain

54%

of organizations have 
insufficient visibility 
into the vulnerabilities 
of their supply 
chain.

When it comes to the supply chain, which is one 
of the areas that demands the most collaboration, 
54% of organizations fail to understand cyber 
vulnerability in their supply chain sufficiently – and it 
shows. Furthermore, 51% of leaders say that their 
supply\-chain partners have not asked them for 
proof of their cybersecurity posture. It seems that 
many organizations do not know the extent of their 
supply\-chain cyber risk because they do not ask. 

Cyberattackers are taking notice of this weakness. 
The MOVEit attacks in June 2023 are a perfect 
illustration of the importance of knowing your 
supply chain. This one attack affected millions 
of individuals and thousands of organizations. 
Through the payment of ransomware funds, it was 
estimated to gain the group behind the attack, 
Cl0P, millions of dollars. 

It was not just the payment of the ransom that Cl0P 
was pursuing: large amounts of personal identifiable 
data, including social security numbers, medical 
records and financial information were stolen 
during the attack.49 For most organizations, a more 
comprehensive understanding of their supply chain, 
its vulnerabilities and its risk could have mitigated 
some of the colossal damage from this single attack. 

The picture gets sharper when organization size is 
included in the analysis. Some 71% of the smallest 
organizations by annual revenue have not been 
asked to prove their cyber posture by their supply 
chain partners in the past 12 months. The picture 
is reversed for the largest organizations by annual 
revenue: 71% have been asked for proof in the past 
12 months. 

As Christophe Blassiau, Senior Vice\-President, 
Cybersecurity and Product Security, Global CISO 
and CPSO, of Schneider Electric, stated:

The cyber maturity gap between large corporations and medium/
small companies is constantly widening, creating a systemic 
supply\-chain security risk. Global companies must have a larger 
play in raising the bar for their smaller partners to prevent them from 
becoming threat vectors.

Curiously, even the 64% of executives who believe 
that their organization’s cyber resilience meets 
(but does not exceed) its minimum requirements 
to operate say they still have an inadequate 
understanding of their supply\-chain cyber 
vulnerabilities. The question that follows is, can 
an organization truly meet its baseline standard of 
cyber resilience if it is partially oblivious to where 
and how its ecosystem puts it at risk?

In the end, one result of an ecosystem that is often 
under\-informed about its risk, under\-insured and 

sceptical about the future of collaborative progress 
is this: 41% of the organizations that suffered a 
material incident in the past 12 months say that a 
third party caused it.

To begin to tackle this issue, the World Economic 
Forum Systems of Cyber Resilience: Electricity 
(SCRE) Initiative (the first of its kind) published a 
report defining cybersecurity\-related roles and 
responsibilities throughout the electricity industry’s 
value and supply chain, based on consensus 
among major stakeholders in the industry.50

41%

of organizations that 
suffered a material impact 
from a cyberattack 
said it originated from 
a third party.

33

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024Conclusion 
The struggle to maintain high\-quality – or 
even adequate – cyber\-resilience capability 
is fast becoming a zero\-sum game.

The ability to cultivate best practices, to compete 
for sufficient talent and, in some cases, simply to 
afford the right tools and services, is increasingly 
determining which organizations win and which lose 
out. As a result, the organizations most lacking can 
least accomplish it. A secure supply chain requires 
all organizations to meet a minimum viability for a 
truly secure ecosystem, but the inequity that exists 
today makes it vulnerable.

Yet it does not have to be this way and there 
are many reasons to be optimistic about the 
near future. Prudent cyber\-resilience practices – 
the fundamentals that cyber professionals and 
prescient business executives have learned are 
wise – are slowly but surely working. Nonetheless, 
something must still change the current trajectory 

Otherwise, as seen throughout 2023, early adoption 
of new technology by leading\-edge organizations, 
the struggle by those on the underside of the curve 
to keep pace with foundational capabilities for trust 
and security, and fragmented incentives within 
digital ecosystems will accelerate digital disparity in 
the coming years. 

Furthermore, the interconnection of the digital 
economy makes it inevitable that the negative effects 
will compound, affecting everyone. Therefore, everyone 
needs to work together to encourage sustainable 
capability for the future – including developing the right 
priorities and organizational culture while providing for 
equitable access to talent, technology and security 
tools. Raising systemic resilience – all organizations 
closing the inequities that divide and improving the 
resilience of what connects – is not only the most 
pressing requirement, it is the greatest responsibility. 

34

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024Appendix: Methodology

The primary dataset used as the foundational 
research was a 23\-question survey with eight 
demographic questions, the Global Cybersecurity 
Outlook Survey, which was launched in June 2023 
and ran until October 2023\. The World Economic 
Forum received 204 survey participants from 49 
countries. Once the dataset was normalized using 
the eight demographic questions to determine the 
qualifications of the participants, the dataset was 
left with 199 qualified participants. Each of the 199 
participants fully completed the survey. 

As additional qualitative data, the Forum performed 
14 one\-on\-one interviews with C\-suite executives, 
asking adjacent or supplemental questions to probe 
further into the survey data collected. 

In October 2023, a 90\-minute workshop was 
held with 37 executives, focused on the themes 
identified within this report. This data was used 
as qualitative data within the report. Additional 
quantitative data was collected in the form of 
a two\-question poll posed to the attendees.

The Forum’s Annual Meeting on Cybersecurity 
was held on 14–16 November 2023\. Several 
sessions were held, and qualitative data was 
gathered from the 140\-plus executives that 
attended the event. During the closing plenary, 
quantitative data was gathered in a form of 
a two\-question poll for the audience.
