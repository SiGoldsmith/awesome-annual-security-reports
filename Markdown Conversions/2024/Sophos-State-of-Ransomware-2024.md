The State of 
Ransomware 2024 

Findings from an independent, vendor\-agnostic survey 
of 5,000 leaders responsible for IT/cybersecurity across 
14 countries, conducted in January\-February 2024\.

Introduction

The fifth Sophos annual study of the real\-world ransomware experiences of 
organizations around the globe explores the full victim journey, from root cause 
through to severity of attack, financial impact, and recovery time. Fresh new insights 
combined with learnings from our previous studies reveal the realities facing 
businesses today as well as how the impact of ransomware has evolved over the 
last five years.

This year’s report also incorporates brand new areas of study, including exploration 
of ransom demands vs. ransom payments, together with a heightened focus on 
the impact an organization’s revenue has on their ransomware outcomes. Plus, 
for the first time, it shines a light on the role of law enforcement in ransomware 
remediation.

A note on reporting dates

To enable easy comparison of data across our annual surveys, we name the report 
for the year in which the survey was conducted: in this case, 2024\. We are mindful 
that respondents are sharing their experiences over the previous year, so many of 
the attacks referenced occurred in 2023\. 

About the survey

The report is based on the findings of an independent, vendor\-agnostic survey 
commissioned by Sophos of 5,000 IT/cybersecurity leaders across 14 countries 
in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. All respondents represent organizations 
with between 100 and 5,000 employees. The survey was conducted by research 
specialist Vanson Bourne between January and February 2024, and participants 
were asked to respond based on their experiences over the previous year. Within the 
education sector, respondents were split into lower education (catering to students 
up to 18 years) and higher education (for students over 18 years).

Rate of Ransomware Attacks

Attacks by Revenue 

59% of organizations were hit by ransomware last year, a small but welcome 
drop from the 66% reported in both the previous two years. While any reduction is 
encouraging, with more than half of organizations experiencing an attack, this is no 
time to lower your guard.

Percentage of organizations hit by ransomware in the last year

Encouragingly, all revenue segments reported a reduction in ransomware attack rate 
in the last year (although for $500M \- $1B it was less than one percentage point). 

The propensity to be hit by ransomware generally increases with revenue, with $5B\+ 
organizations reporting the joint highest rate of attack (67%). However, even the 
smallest organizations (less than $10M revenue) are still regularly targeted, with 
just under half (47%) hit by ransomware in the last year. While many ransomware 
attacks are executed by sophisticated, well\-funded gangs, the use of crude, cheap 
ransomware by lower\-skilled threat actors is on the rise.

Attacks by Industry

Attacks by Country

France reported the highest rate of ransomware attacks in 2024 with 74% of 
respondents saying they had been hit in the last year, followed by South Africa (69%) 
and Italy (68%). Conversely, the lowest reported attack rates were by respondents in 
Brazil (44%), Japan (51%), and Australia (54%).

Overall, nine countries reported a lower attack rate than in 2023\. The five countries 
that reported a higher rate of attack than in 2023 are all in Europe: Austria, France, 
Germany, Italy, and the UK (Germany’s increase was less than 1%). This may reflect 
an increase in targeting of European organizations or that European defenses have 
been less able to keep pace with the evolving attacker behaviors than in other 
geographies.

See the appendix for a detailed breakdown of rate of ransomware attacks by country.

With a few exceptions, ransomware attack rates were broadly consistent across 
the different sectors, with between 60% and 68% of organizations hit in 11 of the 
15 industries covered. The notable winners in this year’s study are state/local 
government (34%) and retail (45%) where fewer than half of respondents reported 
being hit in the last year.

Interestingly, the two government sectors occupy opposing positions, with central/
federal government reporting the highest attack rate across all industries (68%), 
double the rate reported by state/local government (34%). At the same time, 
reflecting the general downward trend in attacks, the central/federal government 
rate is lower than the sector’s 2023 figure of 70%. 

There are several possible reasons behind this government variance. In a year 
of widespread unrest, it may be that central governments have experienced an 
increase in politically motivated attacks. The results could also reflect efforts over 
the last year by state/local government organizations to strengthen their resilience 
to attack – or a shift in approach by adversaries in response to the state/local 
government sector’s limited ability to pay ransoms.

Other notable industry changes over the last year include:

 Ì Reduction in the highest individual rate of attack reported, down from 

80% (lower education) to 69% (central/federal government) 

 Ì The education sector no longer reports the two highest rates 

of attack, coming in at 66% (higher education) and 63% (lower 
education) this year vs. 79% and 80% respectively last year

 Ì Healthcare was one of five sectors that reported an increase 

in attack rate over the last year, up from 60% to 67%

 Ì IT, telecoms, and technology no longer has the lowest attack rate with 55% of 
organizations hit in the last year, an increase from the 50% reported in 2023

See the appendix for a detailed breakdown of rate of ransomware attacks by 
industry.

Percentage of Computers Impacted

On average, just under half (49%) of an organization’s computers are impacted by a 
ransomware attack. Having your full environment encrypted is extremely rare, with 
only 4% of organizations reporting that 91% or more of their devices were impacted. 
At the other end of the scale, while some attacks do impact only a handful of 
devices, this too is highly unusual, with only 2% of affected organizations saying that 
fewer than 1% of their devices were affected.

Percentage of Computers Impacted by Revenue

Percentage of Computers Impacted by Industry

IT, technology and telecoms reported the smallest percentage of devices impacted 
(33%), reflecting the strong cyber posture that is often seen in this sector. 
Conversely, energy, oil/gas and utilities is the sector where the effects of an attack 
are most broadly experienced, with 62% of devices impacted, on average, followed 
by healthcare (58%). Both industries are challenged by higher levels of legacy 
technology and infrastructure controls than most other sectors, which likely makes 
it harder to secure devices, limit lateral movement, and prevent attacks from 
spreading.

See the appendix for a detailed breakdown of percentage of computers impacted by 
industry.

While globally, across all respondents, the distribution was broad, we see 
considerable variation in devices impacted both by organization size and industry. 

As revenue increases, so does the proportion of the computer estate that was 
impacted in the ransomware attack, with the smallest organizations (less than 
$10M) reporting half the percentage of devices impacted compared to those with 
revenue of $1B or more (27% vs. 54%).

There are several factors that may contribute to this finding. Smaller organizations 
are less likely to centrally manage all their devices, reducing the opportunity for 
attacks to spread across the estate. Additionally, most small businesses and 
startups are heavy users of SaaS platforms, reducing the risk of business outage 
from threats like ransomware.

Root Causes of Ransomware Attacks

99% of organizations hit by ransomware were able to identify the root cause of the 
attack, with exploited vulnerabilities the most commonly identified starting point 
for the second year running. Overall, the running order remained consistent with our 
2023 study.

Email\-based approaches were identified as the root cause of attack by 34% of 
respondents, with around twice as many starting with a malicious email (i.e., a 
message with a malicious link or attachment that downloads malware) as phishing 
(i.e., a message designed to trick readers into revealing information). It’s worth 
noting that phishing is typically used to steal log\-in details and as such can be 
considered the first step in a compromised credentials attack.

Exploited Vulnerability Attacks

Root Cause by Industry

While all ransomware attacks have negative outcomes, some are more devastating 
than others. Organizations whose attacks began with exploitation of an unpatched 
vulnerability report considerably more severe outcomes than those where the attack 
started with compromised credentials, including a higher propensity to:

 Ì Have backups compromised 

(75% success rate vs. 54% for compromised credentials)

 Ì Have data encrypted 

(67% encryption rate vs. 43% for compromised credentials)

 Ì Pay the ransom 

(71% payment rate vs. 45% for compromised credentials)

 Ì Cover the full cost of the ransom in\-house (31% funded the full 

ransom in\-house vs. 2% for compromised credentials)

They also reported:

 Ì 4X higher overall attack recovery costs 

($3M vs. $750K for compromised credentials)

 Ì Slower recovery time (45% took more than a month 

vs. 37% for compromised credentials)

For a deeper dive, read Unpatched Vulnerabilities: The Most Brutal Ransomware 
Attack Vector.

Certain weaknesses in cyber defenses are more prevalent in some sectors than 
others, and adversaries are quick to take advantage. As a result, the root cause of 
ransomware attacks varies considerably by industry:

 Ì Energy, oil/gas and utilities is the sector most likely to fall victim to the 

exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities, with almost half (49%) of attacks 
beginning in this way. This industry typically uses a higher proportion of 
older technologies more prone to security gaps than many other sectors, 
and patches may not be available for legacy and end\-of\-life solutions 

 Ì Government organizations are particularly vulnerable to attacks that 

start with abuse of compromised credentials: 49% (state/local) and 47% 
(central/federal) of attacks began with the use of stolen login data

 Ì IT, technology and telecoms and retail both reported that 7% of 

ransomware incidents began with a brute force attack – it may be that 
their reduced exposure to unpatched vulnerabilities and compromised 
credentials forces adversaries to focus, in part, on other approaches

See the appendix for a detailed breakdown of rate of the root cause of attack by 
industry.

A Sophos Whitepaper. April 2024The State of Ransomware 2024 

Root Cause by Revenue

Generally speaking, larger organizations are more likely to experience an attack that 
starts with an unpatched vulnerability, with the $5B\+ segment reporting the highest 
percentage of attacks that started in this way (38%). It is likely that IT infrastructures 
increase in both size and complexity as organizations grow, making it harder for IT 
teams to see all their exposures and patch before they are exploited.

Compromised credentials as a ransomware attack vector peaks in the mid/high 
revenue cohorts and is the top cause of attack in both the $250M\-$500M and 
$500M\-$1B segments. While vulnerabilities and compromised credentials rightly 
get a lot of focus, malicious email is the top reported root cause in $10M\-$50M 
organizations. Overall, email\-based threats account for just under half (49%) of 
attacks in this space.

Backup Compromise

Attempted Backup Compromise 

There are two main ways to recover encrypted data in a ransomware attack: 
restoring from backups and paying the ransom. Compromising an organization’s 
backups enables adversaries to restrict their victim’s ability to recover encrypted 
data and dials up the pressure to pay the ransom. 

94% of organizations hit by ransomware in the past year said that the cybercriminals 
attempted to compromise their backups during the attack. This rose to 99% in both 
state/local government, and the media, leisure and entertainment sector. The lowest 
rate of attempted compromise was reported by distribution and transport, however 
even here more than eight in ten (82%) organizations hit by ransomware said the 
attackers tried to access their backups.

Success Rate of Backup Compromise Attempts

Across all sectors, 57% of backup compromise attempts were successful, meaning 
that adversaries were able to impact the ransomware recovery operations of over 
half of their victims. The analysis revealed considerable variation in adversary 
success rate by sector:

 Ì Attackers were most likely to successfully compromise their 

victims’ backups in the energy, oil/gas and utilities (79% 
success rate) and education (71% success rate) sectors

 Ì IT, technology and telecoms (30% success rate) and retail (47% success 

rate) reported the lowest rates of successful backup compromise

There are several possible reasons behind the differing success rates. It may be that 
IT, telecoms and technology had stronger backup protection in place to start with so 
was more resilient to attack than other sectors. They may also be more effective at 
detecting and stopping attempted compromise before the attackers could succeed. 

Percentage of backup compromise attempts that succeeded

Whatever the cause, organizations that had backups compromised reported 
considerably worse outcomes than those whose backups were not breached:

 Ì Ransom demands were, on average, more than double that of those whose 
backups weren’t impacted ($2\.3M vs. $1M median initial ransom demand)

 Ì Organizations whose backups were compromised were almost twice 
as likely to pay the ransom to recover encrypted data (67% vs. 36%)

 Ì Median overall recovery costs came in eight times higher ($3M 

vs. $375K) for those that had backups compromised

Rate of Data Encryption

Data Encryption Rate by Industry

Seven in ten (70%) ransomware attacks in the last year resulted in data encryption. 
While high, this rate represents a small drop from the 76% of attacks where 
adversaries succeeded in encrypting data that was reported in 2023\. 

The 2024 survey reveals considerable variation in encryption rate across industries.

 Ì While state/local government reported the lowest frequency of attack this 
year (34% hit by ransomware), it also reported the highest rate of data 
encryption, with 98% of attacks resulting in data being encrypted

 Ì Financial services (49%) followed by retail (56%) 
reported the lowest rates of data encryption

 Ì Distribution and transport is the sector most likely to have experienced an 

extortion\-based attack with 17% saying that data was not encrypted but they 
were held to ransom anyway – almost three times the rate of any other sector

Data Theft

Adversaries don’t just encrypt data; they also steal it. In 32% of incidents where data 
was encrypted, data was also stolen – slightly above last year's rate of 30%. Data theft 
increases attackers’ ability to extort money from their victims, while also enabling 
them to further monetize the attack by selling the stolen data on the dark web. 

Again, there is considerable variation by industry. On the surface IT, technology and 
telecoms fares worst, with 53% of attacks where data was encrypted reporting that 
it was also stolen. Energy, oil/gas and utilities is in second position, with data stolen 
in 50% of encryption events. Conversely, the education sector is least likely to report 
data theft in an attack, with higher education reporting the lowest overall propensity 
to have data encrypted and stolen (18%), followed by lower education, which shares 
second spot with healthcare (both 22%). 

Percentage of encryption events where data was also stolen

The findings may reflect differing levels of investigation capabilities across the 
sectors, and differing priorities. Determining whether data has been exfiltrated 
requires higher levels of forensic capabilities and often relies on logs from EDR/XDR 
tools. It may be that the IT, technology and telecoms sector is simply better able to 
identify data theft than other industries. The simplicity of many energy, oil/gas and 
utilities environments may also make theft easier to detect in this sector. Conversely, 
schools often lack the skills and tools to determine whether data has been stolen. 
At the same time, some organizations may prefer not to know if data has been 
exfiltrated as a data breach would require them to undertake expensive disclosures.

Data Recovery

98% of organizations that had data encrypted got data back. The two primary ways 
of recovering data were restoring from backups (68%) and paying the ransom to 
get the decryption key (56%). 26% of those that had data encrypted indicated that 
they used "other means" to get data back – while the survey did not explore this area 
further, this could include working with law enforcement or using decryption keys 
that had already been made public.

A notable change over the last year is the increase in propensity for victims to use 
multiple approaches to recover encrypted data (e.g., paying the ransom and using 
backups). Almost half of organizations that had data encrypted reported using more 
than one method (47%) this time around, more than double the rate reported in 
2023 (21%).

The five\-year view reveals that the gap between use of backups and payment of the 
ransom continues to shrink. Backup use has fallen, albeit slightly, for the second 
consecutive year. At the same time, there has been a 10\-percentage point increase 
in ransom payments since the 2023 study. Propensity to pay the ransom depends 
on many factors, including availability of backups. However, this is a worrying 
trend and it is concerning that over half of victims are resorting to paying for the 
decryption key.

Data Recovery by Revenue 

Data Recovery by Industry

Propensity to pay the ransom to recover data generally increases with revenue. The 
smallest revenue organizations (less than $10M) report by far the lowest ransom 
payment rate (25%) while the largest revenue organizations ($5B\+) have the highest 
payment rate (61%). The fundamental availability of funds to cover the ransom is 
likely a major factor at play here – many very small businesses are simply unable to 
find the money to pay a ransom.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, central/federal government is the sector least likely to pay 
the ransom to get data back – no doubt it is highly limited in the ability to pay by 
regulations – and also reported the highest use of backups to restore data (39% and 
81% respectively).

Overall, there is no smooth correlation between backup use and ransom payments: 

However, as we’ve seen, data recovery is not a case of either backups or ransom. The 
nuances behind data recovery methods become apparent when we dive deeper into 
the data and compare the 2024 figures with last year’s results. 

Outside the sub $10M group, all revenue segments reported an increased ransom 
payment rate compared to last year, and three of them also reported an increase in 
the use of backups to restore the data. While the lowest revenue group reported the 
highest rate of backup use (88%), the $250M\-$500M was close behind (85%).

 Ì Media, leisure and entertainment reported the highest rate of ransom payment 

to recover data (69%) and also one of the higher rates of backup use (74%)

 Ì Energy, oil/gas and utilities has the lowest level of backup use (51%) and 

has a ransom payment rate of 61%, lower than four other sectors

Ransom Demands 

This year, for the first time, we included both ransom demands and payments in 
this report. Across the 1,701 organizations that had their data encrypted and were 
able to share the initial ransom demand from the attackers, the average ask was 
$4,321,880 (mean) and $2M (median). 

One of the most notable findings in this year’s study is that 63% of ransom demands 
are for $1M or more, with 30% of demands for $5M or more. While a small number 
of respondents reported four\-figure ransom demands, these are very much in the 
minority.

Ransom Demand by Revenue

Ransom Demand by Industry

Looking at both mean and median data, the ransom demand trends upward with 
revenue, indicating that adversaries adjust their ransom demand based – in part, at 
least – on likely ability to pay.

Huge ransom demands are no longer the preserve of the highest\-revenue 
organizations, and $1M or more asks are now commonplace across the board: 
47% of organizations with revenue of $10M\-$50M received a seven\-figure ransom 
demand in the last year. 

There are no winners here, with all named sectors (excluding "other") reporting 
median ransom demands of $1M or higher.

 Ì Retail and IT, technology and telecoms received the lowest 
median demands ($1M), followed by construction ($1\.1M)

 Ì Central/federal government is the sector with the biggest target on its 
head, reporting the highest median ($7\.7M) and mean (9\.9M) demands

Ransom Payments

Ransom Payments by Industry

1,097 respondents whose organization paid the ransom shared the actual sum paid. 
Looking at both median and mean averages, we see that ransom payments have 
increased considerably in the last year:

 Ì Median payment: $2,000,000 (a 5X increase on the $400,000 reported in 2023\)

 Ì Mean payment: $3,960,917 (a 2\.6X increase on the $1,542,330 reported in 2023\)

The chart below makes clear how the proportion of lower ransom payments has 
steadily decreased over the last three years, while the proportion of very high 
payments has soared. Paying a seven\-figure or more ransom sum is now the norm.

Just as average ransom demands vary considerably by industry, so too do the 
ransom payments. IT, technology and telecoms reported the lowest median ransom 
payment ($300,000\), followed by distribution and transport ($440,000\). At the other 
end of the scale, both lower education and central/federal government paid median 
ransoms of $6\.6M. 

While there is a broad correlation between lower demands and lower payments (and 
vice versa), there are exceptions – notably distribution and transport, whose median 
ransom demand was north of $2\.8M but paid, on average, $440,000\.

Ransom Demand vs. Ransom Payment

When data has been encrypted, it is an incredibly high\-pressure time for everyone 
involved, with both sides trying to optimize their outcomes. Organizations whose 
data has been encrypted look to minimize the financial impact, while adversaries 
attempt to secure as much money as possible in the shortest possible timeframe, 
often using the threat that the ransom will increase if payment is not made by a 
certain time to pile on further pressure. 

Propensity to Negotiate Ransom Amounts

The study has revealed that victims rarely pay the initial sum demanded by the 
attackers, with only 24% of respondents saying that their payment matched the 
original request. 44% paid less than the original demand, while 31% paid more.

How much was the ransom demand from the attacker(s)? How much was the ransom payment that was paid to the 
attackers? n\=1,097\.

Looking at the data by industry, we see that the two services sectors – business 
and professional services and financial services – are most likely to negotiate down 
the ransom payment, with 67% saying that they paid less than the original demand. 
Manufacturing and production is close behind with 65% of organizations paying less 
than the initial ask.

Conversely, the sectors most likely to pay more than the original demand are those 
with a high proportion of public sector organizations:

 Ì Higher education is most likely to pay more than the original demand (67% paid 

more), and least likely to pay less than the original demand (20% paid less) 

 Ì Healthcare was second most likely to pay more than the original demand 

(57% paid more), followed by lower education (55% paid more)

It may be that these industries are less able to access professional ransom 
negotiators to help reduce their costs. They may also have a greater need to recover 
the data "at any cost" due to their public remit. Either way, it’s clear that there is room 
for movement between the original demand and the eventual payment.

See the appendix for a detailed breakdown of ransom demand vs. ransom payment 
by industry.

Proportion of Ransom Demand Paid

Proportion of Ransom Demand Paid by Industry

While negotiation on the ransom amount occurs in the majority of cases, the 
eventual movement is relatively small with respondents reporting that 94% of the 
original demand was paid, on average, across the full cohort.

Diving deeper, we see that all revenue groups except the very largest were able to 
reduce the size of the ransom payment. The $50M\-$250M segment paid the lowest 
proportion of the initial demand (84%). The only group to pay more than the initial 
ask is the $5B\+ segment which covered, on average, 115% of the ransom demand.

Source of Ransom Funding

Ransom Transaction Execution

Who provides the money for the ransom is an area of considerable interest, and the 
study has revealed a number of insights in this area:

While multiple bodies can contribute to the ransom, funds are typically transferred in 
a single payment by one party. 

 Ì Funding the ransom is a collaborative effort, with respondents reporting 

multiple sources of monies in more than four\-fifths (82%) of cases

 Ì The primary source of ransom funding is the organization itself, 

covering 40% of the payment on average; the organization’s parent 
company and/or governing body typically provides 19% 

 Ì Insurance providers are heavily involved in ransom payments

  23% of all ransom payment funding comes from insurance providers

  Insurance providers contribute toward the ransom in 83% of attacks

  However, providers very rarely (1%) cover the full amount and in 79% 

of cases, the insurer funded less than half of the total payment

Recovery Costs

Ransom payments are just one element of recovery costs when dealing with 
ransomware events. Excluding any ransoms paid, in 2024, organizations reported 
a mean cost to recover from a ransomware attack of $2\.73M, an increase of almost 
$1M from the $1\.82M reported in 2023\.

(2022\)/ 2,006 (2021\). N.B. 2022 and 2021 question wording also included “ransom payment”.

The greatest increase in overall recovery costs was experienced by the lower and 
mid\-revenue segments, with the $250M\-$500M cohort reporting the biggest 
individual increase of $2M (from $885,018 to $2,885,296\).

Organizations with $1B\-$5B revenue reported a (relatively) small increase of just 
over $400,000, while the largest organizations with $5B\+ annual revenue were the 
only cohort to experience a reduction in recovery cost, down from $4,496,096 to 
$3,767,731\.

Looking at the median recovery cost data confirms the trends. Globally, median 
recovery costs doubled from $375,000 to $750,000 over the last year. Increases 
were mostly concentrated in the five lower revenue cohorts who all reported a 
considerable increase in costs, while remaining relatively flat for the two larger.

Recovery Time

The time taken to recover from a ransomware attack is getting steadily longer. Our 
2024 research revealed:

 Ì 35% of ransomware victims are fully recovered in a week 

or less, down from 47% in 2023 and 52% in 2022

 Ì One third (34%) now take more than a month to recover, 

up from 24% in 2023 and 20% in 2022

This slowdown may reflect the increased complexity and severity of attacks, 
necessitating greater recovery work. It may also indicate a growing lack of recovery

Recovery Time: Impact of Backup Compromise

Recovery Time: Impact of Data Encryption

Having your backups compromised has a major impact on overall recovery time. 
Almost half of organizations whose backups are not compromised recover in a week 
or less (46%), compared to a quarter (25%) of those whose backups are affected. 
Having your backups compromised both increases the complexity of recovering 
encrypted data while adding the overhead of creating and securing new, untainted 
backups.

It is likely no surprise that having data encrypted in an attack significantly increases 
recovery time. 57% of those who didn’t have data encrypted were fully recovered 
within a week, compared to 25% of those whose data was encrypted.

Involvement of Law and Order

The nature and availability of official support when dealing with a ransomware 
attack vary on a country\-by\-country basis, as do the tools to report a cyberattack. US 
victims can leverage the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA);

Australian organizations can call on the Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC), to 
name but a few.

Ransomware remains a major threat to organizations of all sizes around the globe. 
While the overall attack rate has dropped over the last two years, the impact of an 
attack on those that fall victim has increased. As adversaries continue to iterate and 
evolve their attacks, it’s essential that defenders and their cyber defenses keep pace. 

Prevention. The best ransomware attack is the one that didn’t happen because the 
adversaries couldn’t get into your organization. With a third of attacks starting with 
exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities, it’s important to take control of your attack 
surface and deploy risk\-based prioritization of patching. The use of MFA to limit 
credential abuse should also be a priority for every single organization. Ongoing user 
training on how to detect phishing and malicious emails remains essential. 

Protection. Strong foundational security is a must, including endpoint, email, and 
firewall technologies. Endpoints (including servers) are the primary destination for 
ransomware actors, so ensure that they are well defended, including dedicated 
anti\-ransomware protection to stop and rollback malicious encryption. Security 
tools need to be correctly configured and deployed to provide optimal protection, so 
look for solutions that deploy out\-of\-the\-box with straightforward posture controls. 
Protection that is complicated and hard to deploy can easily increase risk rather than 
reduce it. 

Detection and response. The sooner you stop an attack, the better. Detecting and 
neutralizing an adversary inside your environment before they can compromise your 
backups or encrypt your data will considerably improve your outcomes. 

Planning and preparation. Having an incident response plan that you are well 
versed in deploying will greatly improve your outcomes if the worst happens and you 
experience a major attack. Regularly practice restoring data from backups to ensure 
speed and fluency should you need to execute in the aftermath of an attack.
