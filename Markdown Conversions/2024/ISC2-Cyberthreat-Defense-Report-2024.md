CyberEdge’s annual Cyberthreat Defense Report (CDR) plays a 
unique role in the IT security industry Other surveys do a great 
job of collecting statistics on cyberattacks and data breaches 
and exploring the techniques of cybercriminals and other bad 
actors Our mission is to provide deep insight into the minds of 
IT security professionals 

A decade after its first edition, the CDR has become a staple 
among IT security leaders and practitioners by helping them 
gauge their internal practices and security investments 
according to those of their counterparts across multiple 
countries and industries If you want to know what your peers 
in IT security are thinking and doing, this is the place to look 

CyberEdge would like to thank our Silver, Gold, and Platinum 
research sponsors, whose continued support is essential to the 
success of this report 

Top Five Insights for 2024

Our CDR reports yield dozens of actionable insights Here are 
the top five takeaways from this year’s installment:

1 

 Confidence is building Several long\-running trends 
have reversed in the last year or two Survey data contains 
multiple indications that security professionals are becoming 
more confident about their ability to reduce the impact of 
cyberattacks The percentage of organizations compromised 
by cyberattacks fell substantially from the previous survey 
(page 7\), and our respondents expect the number to fall 
even more this year (page 9\) We also saw improvements in 
our Threat Concern Index (page 18\) and Security Concern 
Index (page 31\) The former measures the overall level of 
concern about cyberthreats, and the latter measures the 
concern for inhibitors to IT security team success 

Survey Demographics

• Responses received from 1,200 qualified IT security 

decision makers and practitioners

• All from organizations with more than 500 employees

• Representing 17 countries across North America, Europe, 
Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa

• Representing 19 industries

 AI is taking center stage Artificial intelligence technologies 
are being incorporated into a very wide range of security 
solutions They promise to increase the power of security 
professionals to detect and block attacks, respond to 
incidents, and find and remediate vulnerabilities Security 
teams are looking at AI as a force multiplier that will make 
them more productive and effective (page 21\) Survey 
respondents expect AI to be deployed in many ways to both 
enhance and defeat cybersecurity measures A plurality 
thinks the positive and negative outcomes will be in balance 
However, of the rest, significantly more believe the benefits 
to security teams will be greater than the benefits to threat 
actors, creating an overall “Advantage to Security” (page 25\) 

 Ransomware trends are changing direction Several 
persistent trends related to ransomware have turned around 
Compared to our last survey, significantly fewer respondents 
reported that their organization had been victimized by 
ransomware The percentage of affected organizations 
paying ransoms declined, and so did the number of 
organizations that paid ransoms and managed to recover 
their data The reasons for these changes are complex, but 
we think we have untangled some of the threads (page 27\)

 Funding for security groups is not a problem A record 
number of security groups expect their budget to increase 
this year, and the size of the average expected budget 
increase grew (page 35\) 

 Cybersecurity experts are now sitting on boards We 
found that three out of five organizations have a member 
of the board of directors with cybersecurity experience 
This has tremendous implications for the ways that security 
leaders and top executives interact (page 51\) 

About This Report

By revealing these details, we hope to help IT security decision 
makers and practitioners gain a better understanding of how 
their perceptions, concerns, priorities, and defenses stack up 
against those of their peers around the world IT security teams 
can use the CDR’s data, analyses, and findings to shape answers 
to many important questions, such as: 

 Where do we have gaps in our cyberthreat defenses relative 

to other organizations?

 Have we fallen behind in our defensive strategy to the point 

that our organization is now the “low\-hanging fruit” (i e , likely 
to be targeted more often due to its relative weaknesses)?

The CDR is the most geographically comprehensive, vendor\-
agnostic study of IT security decision makers and practitioners 
Rather than compiling cyberthreat statistics and assessing 
the damage caused by data breaches, the CDR surveys the 
perceptions of IT security professionals, gaining insights into 
how they see the world 

 Are we on track with both our approach and progress in 
continuing to address traditional areas of concern while 
tackling the challenges of emerging threats?

 How does our level of spending on IT security compare 

to that of other organizations?

Specifically, the CDR examines:

 The frequency of successful cyberattacks in the prior year 
and optimism (or pessimism) about preventing further 
attacks in the coming year

 The perceived impact of cyberthreats and the challenges 

organizations face in mitigating their risks

 The adequacy of organizations’ security postures and their 

internal security practices

 The organizational factors that present the most significant 

barriers to establishing effective cyberthreat defenses

 Do other IT security practitioners think differently about 

cyberthreats and their defenses, and should we adjust our 
perspective and plans to account for these differences?

Another important objective of the CDR is to provide developers 
of IT security technologies and services with information they 
can use to better align their solutions with the concerns and 
requirements of potential customers Our data can lead to better 
market traction and success for solution providers, along with 
better cyberthreat protection technologies for our resolute 
security professionals 

The findings of the CDR are divided into four sections:

 Current investments in security technologies and those 

Section 1: Current Security Posture

planned for the coming year

 The health of IT security budgets and the portion of the 

overall IT budget they consume

Our journey into the world of cyberthreat defenses begins 
with respondents’ assessments of the effectiveness of their 
organization’s investments and strategies relative to the

prevailing threat landscape They report on the frequency of 
successful cyberattacks, judge their organization’s security 
posture in specific IT domains and security functions, and 
provide details on the IT security skills shortage The data will 
help readers begin to assess:

 Whether, to what extent, and how urgently changes are 

needed in their own organization

 Specific countermeasures that should be added to 

supplement existing defenses

Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns

In this section, our exploration of cyberthreat defenses shifts 
from establishing baseline security postures to determining 
the types of cyberthreats and obstacles to security that most 
concern today’s organizations The survey respondents weigh 
in on the most alarming cyberthreats, barriers to establishing 
effective defenses, and high\-profile issues such as ransomware 
and security for hybrid cloud environments These appraisals will 
help readers think about how their own organization can best 
improve cyberthreat defenses going forward 

Section 3: Current and Future Investments

Organizations can ill afford to stand still when it comes to 
maintaining effective cyberthreat defenses IT security teams 
must keep pace with changes occurring in business, technology, 
and threat landscapes This section of the survey provides data 
on the direction of IT security budgets, and on current and 
planned investments in network security, endpoint security, 
application and data security, and security management and 
operations Readers will be able to compare their organization’s 
investment decisions against the broad sample and get a sense 
of what “hot” technologies their peers are deploying 

This year we added a special three\-question section on positive 
and negative outcomes expected when security teams and 
threat actors deploy AI 

Section 4: Practices and Strategies

Mitigating today’s cyberthreat risks takes more than investing 
in the right technologies You must ensure those technologies 
are deployed optimally, configured correctly, and monitored 
adequately to give your organization a fighting chance to avoid 
being a front\-page news story In the final section of the survey 
our respondents provide information on how they are deploying 
and using leading\-edge technologies and services such as 
security analytics and IT security delivered from the cloud We 
also look at how IT security training and professional certification 
can help enterprises address the serious shortfall in skilled IT 
security staff

Current Security Posture
 Yes, some things are getting better The percentage of 

organizations compromised by successful attacks declined 
for the third consecutive year (page 7\) 

 Crazy optimistic about 2024 The percentage of security 
professionals who think a successful attack is likely or very 
likely has fallen by 9 4% over two years, to 66 7% (page 9\) 

 ICS and IoT are concerns Respondents are confident their 

organization can defend against attacks on SaaS applications 
and servers but are worried about application containers and 
industrial systems (page 11\) 

 Doubts about four security functions Many respondents 
think their organization needs to improve app testing and 
development, detection of rogue insiders, user security 
awareness, and third\-party risk management (page 13\) 

 Still can’t hire enough Despite recent layoffs at tech firms, 

enterprises are still facing a daunting shortage of experienced 
IT security people (page 15\) 

Perceptions and Concerns
 Feeling better about threats Security teams are concerned 

about a lot of threats, but their level of concern for all 13 threat 
types has fallen (page 17\) 

 Everyone experiences web and mobile attacks Web and 
mobile attacks don’t just plague financial firms and online 
retailers – they affect nine out of 10 organizations (page 19\) 

 AI will help the good guys Our respondents think AI 

technologies will be force multipliers for security teams 
(page 21\) 

 AI will help the bad guys The respondents are also aware 
that threat actors will be employing AI for a wide variety of 
malicious activities (page 23\) 

 AI advantage to security? On balance, 50% more security 
professionals believe that AI will help the good guys than 
believe it will help the bad guys (page 25\) 

 Ransomware U\-turns Several ransomware trends have 

changed direction: fewer organizations were victimized, fewer 
ransoms were paid, and less data was recovered (page 27\) 

 People problems The biggest barriers to successful cyber 
defense are people related: low security awareness among 
employees and lack of skilled security personnel (page 30\) 

 Happiness can be (relatively) cheap Some factors that 
improve job satisfaction and employee retention are 
expensive, but other effective incentives aren’t (page 32\) 

 Security training works 87% of respondents agree that 

IT security training helps them do their jobs better (and only 
3% disagree) (page 34\) 

Current and Future Investments
 Security budgets are rising The mean annual increase in 
IT security budgets reached a record high of 5 7% (page 35\) 

 A new king of the hill in network security Secure web 
gateways replaced advanced threat protection products 
as the most frequently installed network security technology 
(page 37\) 

 Endpoint security workhorses Anti\-malware, DLP, EDR, and 
EPP solutions are the most popular endpoint security products 
(page 39\) 

 Three must\-haves The “must\-have” solutions for application 
and data security are database firewalls, web application 
firewalls, and API protection products (page 41\) 

 AD for ZT For the third year running, Active Directory 
protection tops the list of security management and 
operations technologies If you can’t trust Active Directory, 
you can’t trust your zero trust implementation (page 43\) 

Practices and Strategies
 Put the Sec in DevSecOps Development groups are 

recognizing that security and DevSecOps practices really 
matter (page 45\) 

 Partly cloudy forecast The percentage of security 

applications delivered from the cloud is growing, but 
acceptance varies widely by country and by industry (page 47\) 

 Many uses for threat intelligence Security teams are finding 
many ways to leverage external threat intelligence (page 49\) 

 Cybersecurity savvy on boards A surprising number of 

organizations (62 2%) have at least one member of the board 
of directors with a cybersecurity background (page 51\) 

 Way past hype Nine relatively new technologies and 

architectures are in use or being implemented by at least 
70% of organizations (page 53\)

 Past Frequency of Successful Cyberattacks

How many times do you estimate that your organization’s global network has been compromised 
by a successful cyberattack within the past 12 months? 

In the 2023 CDR report, we said that IT security teams may 
have reached a turning point After successful attacks increased 
steadily year after year, the curve seemed to have flattened out, 
and even started to reverse Perhaps there is room for optimism, 
we thought Perhaps we are not doomed to an endless cycle of 
bad news 

Well, our latest data strongly confirms that positive change in 
direction The precentage of organizations compromised at 
least once by a successful cyberattack in the previous 12 months 
edged down from 86 2% in the 2021 CDR, to 85 3% in 2022, to 

At least one successful attack
Six or more successful attacks

84 7% in 2023 In this survey, the decrease was more substantial, 
falling 3 2% to 81 5% (see the blue bars in Figure 1\) While that 
is still high by historical standards, it shows that the tide has 
definitely turned 

Even more striking, the percentage of organizations experiencing 
six or more successful attacks dropped a whopping 11 2%, from 
39 2% to 27 8% (see Figure 2 and the red bars in Figure 1\) We 
haven’t seen a figure that low since 2018 

It’s too early to start celebrating, though Organizations of all 
sizes are still exposed to thousands of low\-level attacks every 
day The financial, regulatory, and reputational costs of data 
breaches continue to rise Ransom payments have soared as 
well (see page 28\) But cybersecurity professionals can take 
satisfaction in the fact that they’re blocking more attacks than 
in any year since 2020 

What is causing this turnaround? We suggest several factors:

 A significant number of work\-from\-home (WFH) employees 
returning to offices, where their devices are better protected 
from cyberattacks

 The payoff from large investments in zero trust, cloud 

security tools, advanced authentication, extended detection 
and response (XDR), and other innovative cybersecurity 
technologies (see page 53\)

 More attention to basic security hygiene (vulnerability 

detection and patching), including investments in risk\-based 
vulnerability management (RBVM) and cyber exposure 
management solutions

 Increased applications of AI and machine learning (ML) 

to cybersecurity tools (see pages 21\-26\) 

 More investment in security awareness training for users 

and professional training for cybersecurity staffs

 More\-effective cooperation between government law 
enforcement agencies, industry groups, and individual 
enterprises

It’s worth keeping in mind that mileage may vary The prevalence 
of successful attacks is not uniform across the globe or among 
industries 

For example, you might want to think twice before accepting a 
cybersecurity job in Mexico A full 97% of organizations reported 
at least one compromise last year, and about half (52%) suffered 
six or more Other countries where at least 85% of organizations 
experienced a successful attack were South Africa (89 6%), 
Colombia (87 5%), Spain (87 5%), and Brazil (85 3%) At the other 
end of the spectrum, 75 5% of Australian organizations reported 
one or more successful attacks, along with 72 9% of Japanese 
and 70 0% of Italian organizations (see Figure 3\) 

Of the major industries tracked in our survey, financial 
institutions suffered most frequently from successful attacks 
(presumably “because that’s where the money is”), followed 
by telecom \& technology firms, while manufacturing and retail 
were least affected (see Figure 4\)

Future Likelihood of Successful Cyberattacks

What is the likelihood that your organization’s network will become compromised 
by a successful cyberattack in 2024? 

The positive trend we noted in the previous section extends 
to expectations for the coming year The percentage of survey 
respondents who think a successful attack in 2024 is somewhat 
or very likely fell a substantial 5 1%, from 71 8% to 66 7% The 
decline over two years, from the 2022 report to this one, is 9 4% 
(see the blue bars in Figure 5\)

Figure 5: Percentage of organizations indicating that compromise 
by a successful cyberattack in 2024 is somewhat or very likely.

The pattern continues for those saying that one or more 
successful attacks are very likely Their number dropped 
precipitously, from 32 9% to 21 2% 

These figures do raise an interesting question If 81 5% of 
organizations experienced at least one compromise last year 
(Figure 1\), is it reasonable that only 66 7% will undergo the 
same fate this year (Figure 5\)? Optimism is a good thing As the 
poet Alexander Pope wrote: “Hope springs eternal in the human 
breast ” However, we think these forecasts involve a bit of 
wishful thinking 

When breaking down the predictions by country, it is interesting 
to note that those expecting the greatest number of successful 
attacks this year are all in Asia: China (84 0%), Singapore (81 6%), 
and Japan (79 2%) (see Figure 6\) The least pessimistic are France 
(58 9%), Italy (57 1%), and South Africa (46 0%) 

And maybe you do want to accept that job in Mexico, at least 
if you enjoy working with optimists Although 97 0% of our 
respondents in Mexico reported being compromised last year, 
only 62 5% think the same thing will happen in 2024 

“Optimism is a good thing As the poet 

Alexander Pope wrote: ‘Hope springs eternal 

in the human breast ’ However, we think these 

forecasts involve a bit of wishful thinking ”

Figure 8: Perceived security posture by IT domain.

We asked the survey respondents to rate their organization’s 
ability to defend itself across 13 IT domains 

Our security professionals were most comfortable about the 
security of SaaS applications, with a score of 4 11 (on a scale of 
1 to 5, with 5 being the best possible security posture) This 
reflects a high level of confidence in SaaS vendors and their 
ability to protect cloud\-based software It’s also a nod to the 

91 6% of organizations that have already deployed SaaS security 
posture management (SSPM) solutions or are in the process of 
doing so (see page 53\) 

Respondents are also relatively satisfied with defenses for servers 
(4 08\) and datastores such as file servers, databases, and storage 
area networks (4 07\) In fact, datastores is one of only three areas 
where confidence increased from last year (more on that in 
a minute)

At the opposite end of the list, industrial control systems (ICS)/
SCADA devices remained the area with the lowest score for 
security posture (3 88\) Security professionals continue to be 
concerned about the potential for attacks on manufacturing 
and operations technologies (OT), a lack of security solutions 
for that realm, and the challenges of integrating OT security 
with traditional data security They may also be on edge because 
of the potential for attacks on industrial infrastructure as an 
outgrowth of national and regional conflicts (see page 59\) 

“A significant change from past years is the 

increase in concern about protecting application 

workloads in Docker and Kubernetes containers 

This trend likely reflects a combination of 

the growing use of containerization for key 

applications and increased targeting of these 

workloads by threat actors ”

A significant change from past years is the increase in concern 
about protecting application workloads in Docker and 
Kubernetes containers This area fell from sixth place last year to 
twelfth in this survey In fact, the score for containers decreased 
by 14, from 4 06 to 3 92, the biggest drop for any IT domain 
This trend likely reflects a combination of the growing use of 
containerization for key applications and increased targeting 
of these workloads by threat actors 

Speaking of lower scores, this year confidence in security posture 
dropped in 10 of the 13 domains That doesn’t mean that there 
have been more successful attacks on those targets Rather, it 
implies that, in the continuing parallel arms races in different 
areas of IT security, security professionals know they need to be 
increasingly vigilant if they want to stay ahead of the bad guys 

On the other hand, there was one positive surprise Internet of 
Things (IoT) devices have been one of the top three areas of 
concern for several years In this survey, they fell back to fifth 
from the bottom Their score actually improved slightly from 
last year, going from 3 95 to 3 97 This reflects the introduction 
of new security solutions for IoT, as well as the ability of existing 
security product vendors to monitor and protect IoT devices

Assessing IT Security Functions

On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate the adequacy of your organization’s capabilities 
(people and processes) in each of the following functional areas of IT security:

Identity and access management (IAM)

Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC)

Cyber risk quantification and reporting

Security engineering / architecture and design

Incident investigation and response

Detection of advanced / sophisticated threats

Attack surface reduction
(patch management, pen testing)

Confidence in the adequacy of defenses across functional areas 
of IT security fell significantly this year, declining in 11 of the 12 
categories tracked 

The decline in scores was moderate in the categories at the 
top of the list For example, the score for identity and access 
management (IAM) fell from 4 13 to 4 09, but that function 
continued in a tie for having the most satisfactory people and 
processes (see Figure 9\) 

Two other areas of IT security moved way up on the list this 
year Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) and cyber risk 
quantification and reporting jumped from sixth place and 
eighth place, respectively, to a three\-way tie for first with IAM 
Recently, enterprises have started putting a lot more emphasis 
on GRC and risk quantification Part of this focus is attributable 
to evolving government regulations and industry standards 
that demand better governance and risk management Part is

due to CEOs and boards of directors now being held directly 
accountable for cybersecurity incidents, and therefore getting 
involved in IT security investment decisions And part may be 
a result of boards of directors now including members with 
cybersecurity experience (see page 51\) 

However, the most striking finding for this question is the relative 
loss of confidence in the adequacy of security capabilities for the 
four functional areas at the bottom of the list 

Application development and testing (SDLC and DevSecOps) fell 
from second place last year, with a score of 4 13, to ninth in this 
survey, with a score of 4 02 Detection of rogue insiders dropped 
from fourth (score: 4 13\) to tenth (score: 4 01\) 

The bottom two items on the list only slipped one place 
each from last year, but their scores declined significantly: 
user security awareness and education from 4 08 to 4 01 and 
third\-party risk management (TPRM) from 4 07 to 3 99 

We don’t think that defenses in these functions have objectively 
gotten worse, but security professionals are becoming more 
concerned that they are falling behind the pace of innovation 

“Recently, enterprises have started putting a lot 

more emphasis on GRC and risk quantification

shown by threat actors Also, more organizations may have 
recognized the increased importance of improving application 
security, detecting insider attacks, educating users, and detecting 
malware in purchased devices and software, and decided that 
their existing defenses in these functions need improvement

The IT Security Skills Shortage

Select the roles/areas for which your organization is currently experiencing a shortfall 
of skilled IT security personnel (Select all that apply ) 

The security skills shortage is persistent, widespread, and 
consequential 

(24 6%) These numbers are all down from last year, but they are 
roughly in line with the findings from our 2020 and 2021 reports 

Our data indicates that the shortage of skilled IT security 
personnel eased a touch over the last 12 months but remains 
at high levels As shown in Figure 10, the percentage of 
organizations experiencing a shortfall in at least one role fell 
slightly, from 86 6% to 85 8%, but that is still the third\-highest 
figure since we started asking this question 

A similar picture emerges when we look at specific jobs (see 
Figure 11\) For every security role in our survey, between a 
quarter and just over a third of organizations have openings 
they can’t fill 

IT security administrators are the most sought\-after (there is a 
shortfall in 35 4% of organizations) Close behind are IT security 
analysts, operators, and incident responders (32 4%) and IT 
security architects and engineers (32 3%) And almost as many 
organizations have vacancies in the remaining roles: IT security 
and compliance auditors (26 1%), DevSecOps engineers (25 6%), 
risk and fraud analysts (25 0%), and application security testers

(Facebook), Salesforce, LinkedIn, Discord, Snapchat, SAP, Spotify, 
and others, have made the news Also, many medium\-size and 
small businesses have cut staff to reduce expenses Although 
many are retaining their cybersecurity experts, not all have been

Are tech industry layoffs a bad sign for security professionals? 
And conversely, are they a good sign for hiring managers 
desperately trying to fill vacancies? We wouldn’t advise anyone 
to get too excited, at least in the short term, because there is 
still a massive deficit in qualified staff According to the 2023 

ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study, in 2023 the gap between 
the number of cybersecurity professionals that organizations 
require to defend themselves and the number of such personnel 
available actually increased by 12 6% worldwide – and 19 7% in 
North America 

“Are tech industry layoffs a bad sign for security 

professionals? And conversely, are they a good 

sign for hiring managers desperately trying to fill 

vacancies? We wouldn’t advise anyone to get too 

excited, at least in the short term, because there is 

still a massive deficit in qualified staff ”

Now, in the medium and long term, AI may have a significant 
impact on the shortage by increasing the productivity of 
cybersecurity workers, and perhaps even making some job 
descriptions obsolete We discuss that hypothesis in The Road 
Ahead section of this report, on page 58 

Why did we say that the security skills shortage is consequential? 
You can see the evidence on page 30, which shows that a lack 
of skilled IT security personnel is currently the second\-biggest 
factor inhibiting organizations from adequately defending 
themselves, second only to low security awareness among 
employees It has been the \#1 or \#2 factor for eight years now

data indicating that their attitudes have changed decisively in 
a positive direction Their overall level of concern decreased for 
every one of the 13 cyberthreats included in the question 

The “big four” cyberthreats continued to be malware (with a score 
of 3 89, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being extremely concerned), 
phishing (3 87\), account takeover and credential abuse attacks 
(3 81\), and ransomware (3 80\) (see Figure 12\) These were in the 
same order as last year, except that phishing and account takeover 
swapped the \#2 and \#3 spots

However, the scores for account takeover attacks and ransomware 
declined substantially compared to typical year\-to\-year 
movements on this question The score for account takeover 
attacks fell by 14 and ransomware declined by 10 

3\.72

Given the heavy press coverage of ransomware, this last figure 
might seem surprising But you can find the explanation on 
pages 27\-29 Although the median ransom amount increased 
substantially last year, the percentage of organizations affected 
by a ransomware attack, and the percentage paying a ransom, 
both decreased 

Denial of service attacks, advanced persistent threats, 
SSL\-encrypted threats, web application attacks, insider threats, and 
attacks on brand and reputation continued to be serious concerns, 
with scores between 3 66 and 3 75 However, except for the first, 
those scores declined between 08 and 13 from the last survey 
Denial of service attacks were the exception, down only 02 

What do these declines add up to? Every year we average the 
concern scores for all the cyberthreat types into what we call our 
Threat Concern Index As shown in Figure 13, the overall concern 
for cyberthreats has fallen for two years running, from a record 
high of 3 88 in the 2022 CDR, to 3 82 in the 2023 edition, to 3 72 
this year 

Last year we attributed the decrease in the Threat Concern Index 
to workers returning to offices with more security in place than in 
homes, increased investment by organizations in ML, AI, and other 
advanced technologies, and the widespread implementation of 
zero trust frameworks We think those are still the primary drivers 
of the more\-positive attitude we see in this data

Web and mobile application attacks are particularly menacing to 
enterprises that transact business on the web and through mobile 
apps, especially financial institutions and retailers that can lose 
substantial sums to online fraud But these attacks can affect any 
organization that handles customer, client, or constituent data 
Threat actors employ web and mobile application attacks to steal 
credentials and personal information, which they can then use to 
impersonate victims to carry out data breaches, identity theft, and 
other crimes The problem is made worse when people reuse the 
same passwords for multiple personal and work accounts 

We asked respondents to select the three web and mobile 
application attacks that most concern them (or to say that their 
organization is not affected by any of these attacks) The results 
are shown in Figure 14 

What did we learn? In this group, the greatest concern today is 
account takeover (ATO) and credential stuffing attacks, which 
use stolen and leaked passwords and email addresses to break 
into networks and applications These were cited by 43 9% of the 
respondents This was a substantial increase from last year’s figure

of 40 2% (an increment of 3 7%, to be precise) The widespread 
use of these attacks is prompting more consumer\- and client\-
facing organizations to adopt two\-factor and passwordless 
authentication methods, despite the added inconvenience to users 

Attacks that harvest personally identifiable information (PII) 
moved down from first place in the last survey to second in this 
one However, the number of citations was essentially the same 
(42 5% versus 42 3%), indicating that worries about these threats 
have not abated 

The other five attack types maintained the same order as in the

One of the hottest topics in technology right now is artificial 
intelligence People are wondering, will AI be a boon or a bane? 
Will it become a valuable servant of humanity, or a malicious 
overlord bent on destroying our species? And most important, 
how will it affect my job?

We are just as curious as the next person, so we added a special 
three\-question section about AI to this survey We asked how AI 
technologies will enhance the work of security teams, how it will 
be employed by threat actors, and whether on balance AI will 
benefit security teams or threat actors more 

When asked to select the top three ways technologies such as 
ML and generative AI will benefit IT security teams, the most 
common response, by a wide margin, was “Improve our ability 
to detect/block cyberthreats ” This was selected by 56 0% of our 
respondents (see Figure 17\) At a time when attack surfaces are 
expanding and threat actors are bombarding our networks with 
an endless variety of probes and assaults, defenders are looking 
to AI to sort through mountains of hay to find, prioritize, and 
where appropriate, swiftly block, the hidden needles

96\.9%

Figure 18: Belief that security teams will benefit from AI.

In second place, selected by about half of respondents, is 
“Improve our ability to respond to security incidents” (49 5%) 
Incident response often involves sifting through a great deal 
of information to figure out what systems have been affected, 
what changes have been made and actions taken by attackers, 
and what steps to take to contain attacks AI can certainly help 
security teams perform that work faster and more accurately, 
potentially before attacks do any damage 

The third item on the list is “Improve our ability to detect/
patch vulnerabilities” (49 0%) This is another security area that 
involves a lot of data analysis and pattern recognition, and AI 
technologies can greatly increase their effectiveness 

Next comes “Improve workforce efficiency/accomplish more 
with fewer resources,” selected by two of five respondents 
(40 2%) It reflects the hope that AI technologies can be a force 
multiplier for overworked security teams, making them more 
efficient and productive This outcome would go a long way 
toward mitigating the cybersecurity skills shortage that has 
plagued IT groups for many years (page 15\) 

Rounding out the selections, also at 40 2%, is “Improve our ability 
to research threat actors and their tactics ” Again, this view speaks 
to the ability of AI technologies to recognize patterns in large 
masses of data 

The fact that all five benefits were selected by at least 40% of the 
respondents shows that AI technologies are going to be applied 
across a wide spectrum of cybersecurity use cases, not just in 
one or two niches 

Our data also reveals that AI skeptics are rare Only 3 1% of 
respondents selected “I don’t believe my IT security team will 
benefit from AI” (see Figure 18\) 

“People are wondering, will AI be a boon or

Cybersecurity industry analysts also predict that advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), 
including nefarious chatbots (e g , WormGPT, FraudGPT, DarkBART), will improve how cyberthreat 
actors operate Which of the following negative outcomes of AI do you predict will impact your 
organization the most? (Select up to three )

And now, the other side of the coin If AI can be a friend to IT 
security teams, can it also be a minion of evildoers?

When asked to select the top three ways that AI technologies 
could make cyberthreat actors more effective, the most 
popular answer was “Improved ability to discover weaknesses 
in cybersecurity defenses,” chosen by 45 4% of respondents 
Cybercriminals and state\-sponsored hackers spend a lot of time 

searching for unpatched software and devices, misconfigured 
systems, badly coded applications, unprotected data stores, and 
other vulnerabilities AI can make their job a lot easier 

In second place was “Increased sophistication of cyberthreats,” 
selected by 41 7% There is a danger that AI tools can learn the 
tricks and techniques of the very best (or should we say the very 
worst) black hat coders and criminal planners, and then give 
their powers to every run\-of\-the\-mill gang

The third choice was “More effective, well\-written phishing/
spear\-phishing emails,” picked by 40 7% Remember the days 
when you could identify phishing emails based on bad grammars 
and mispelings? Today, a simple ChatGPT prompt can instantly 
produce messages written in the style of your CFO (see Figure 20\) 
Maybe now the tipoff is that the email is better written than the 
ones you get from the CFO 

“Today, a simple ChatGPT prompt can instantly 

produce messages written in the style of your CFO 

Maybe now the tipoff is that the email is better 

written than the ones you get from the CFO ”

Rounding out the list were “Increased volume of cyberthreats” 
(37 4%), “Potential fraud associated with deepfake photos, videos, 
or audio” (36 9%), and “Improved ability to uncover zero\-day 
vulnerabilities” (30 9%) 

These responses show that our security professionals expect 
a wide variety of negative use cases for AI and ML, just as they 
anticipate an assortment of positive use cases 

And just as very few are skeptical of the power of AI for security 
teams, only a handful (3 6%) agreed with the statement, “I don’t 
believe cyberthreat actors will benefit from AI” (see Figure 21\) 

The clear consensus: prepare for a complex AI battlefield, with 
IT security teams and cyberthreat actors challenging each other 
across a wide range of domains

Net Impact of AI on Cybersecurity

Ultimately, who do you believe will benefit more from advancements in artificial intelligence 
(AI) – IT security teams (with improved defenses) or cyberthreat actors (with improved tactics)?

So, if AI is going to be used extensively by both IT security 
teams and cyberthreat actors, who is going to come out ahead?

Our respondents are divided The largest group (40 6%) think 
the opposing sides will benefit about equally The next biggest 
band (35 6%) are the optimists who believe that IT security 
teams will benefit more But the party of pessimists who predict 
that cyberthreat actors will benefit more is also large: 23 8% 
(see Figure 22\) 

To net out the positive and negative sentiments, we defined a 
measure called “Advantage to Security,” which is the difference 
between the percentage of optimists and the percentage of 
pessimists For our total sample, that works out to 11 8% (35 6% 
minus 23 8%)

The difference in outlook by industry is even greater The AI 
enthusiasts in retail, technology, and education show a net 
advantage to security teams of 21 9%, 20 7%, and 20 7% In 
contrast, the worrywarts in government and finance actually 
show an Advantage to Security deficit; that is, more of them 
believe that AI will, on balance, help cyberthreat actors than 
the other way around (see Figure 24\) 

When we break down responses by organization size, we find 
that respondents from smaller organizations show the greatest 
net advantage to security teams: 17 5% for organizations with 
500\-999 employees and 13 2% for organizations with 1,000\-
4,999, versus 5 5% to 11 8% for the other size tiers We think the

Responding to Ransomware 

If victimized by ransomware in the past 12 months, did your organization pay a ransom 
(using Bitcoins or other anonymous currency) to recover data? 

The dynamics of the ransomware “market” are complex The 
number of successful attacks, the size of ransoms demanded, 
and the percentage of victimized organizations that elect to 
pay ransoms can gyrate based on multiple reinforcing and 
offsetting factors These include the changing capabilities and 
motivations of ransomware gangs; the nature of attacks (now 
typically including two or three types of extortion); the ability 
of organizations to block, contain, or recover from attacks; 
pressures from outside parties such as law enforcement agencies 
and cyber insurance companies; and issues of trust 

So, it may not be easy to unsnarl the tangled threads of cause 
and effect over the last year – but we can try

Figure 26: Percentage of organizations victimized by ransomware.

During 2023, some of the major trends in ransomware activities 
we had been tracking suddenly changed direction To start 
with, after increasing steadily for five years, the percentage of 
organizations victimized by ransomware abruptly fell from 
72 7% to 64 1% (see Figure 26\) 

We believe this reversal was caused by several factors:

 Organizations have invested in monitoring and security 
tools to quickly detect and contain ransomware attacks 
before they do serious damage (in part because these 
capabilities are required to obtain cyber insurance policies) 

 With more workers returning to the office post\-COVID 19, 

the attack surface has shrunk somewhat 

 Ransomware gangs are targeting fewer, larger enterprises 

and spending less time on small and medium\-sized 
organizations 

Why would a ransomware gang attack fewer targets? The 
members might decide to go after large enterprises that 
could be induced to pay million\-dollar or multi\-million\-dollar 
ransoms But to extract large payments from sophisticated 
organizations, the gang would need to research each victim, 
develop techniques to overcome advanced defenses, exfiltrate 
data as well as encrypt files, carry out prolonged negotiations, 
etc This approach might result in a high return on investment 
from attacking targets with deep pockets but would lose 
money if applied to smaller victims

There is indeed evidence for this dynamic According to ransomware 
experts at Coveware, the average ransom payment soared from 
$408,644 in the fourth quarter of 2022 to $568,705 in the fourth 
quarter of 2023, and was even higher (up to $850,700\) in the 

second and third quarters of 2023 (see Figure 27\) And the firm 
found that the average size of victimized organizations grew 
during much of the same period (see the Coveware July 2023 
and October 2023 quarterly reports)

Now for our second turnaround The percentage of organizations 
affected by ransomware that decided to pay ransoms rose 
steadily between the 2018 and 2022 CDRs, declined slightly in 
the 2023 report, and fell sharply this year from 59 7% to 49 3%

There are at least three factors behind this change in attitude 
toward ransom payments:

 Organizations have been investing in tools that support 
secure, reliable backups and faster recovery to increase 
their resiliency, allowing them to restart operations faster 

49\.4%

71\.6%

72\.2% 72\.7%

66\.8%

61\.2%

57\.0%

 Government and law enforcement agencies discourage 
payments and are threatening to enforce measures such 
as the U S Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets 
Control (OFAC) advisory prohibiting ransom payments to 
criminal and terrorist organizations 

 Enterprises no longer trust ransomware gangs to honor 
their agreements to keep data breaches secret and help 
ransom payers recover their data 

And our final U\-turn: of organizations that paid ransoms, the 
percentage that ultimately recovered data fell from 72 7% to 
57 0% (see Figure 29\) It appears that ransomware gangs are 
more frequently failing to honor their agreements to help 
victims recover data 

In terms of industries, those most often victimized by ransomware 
attacks are finance (86 7%), telecom \& technology (72 0%), and 
education (61 4%) Retail (54 7%) and government (47 5%) are 
affected least often (see Figure 30\)

Have you ever seen the video of the robot arm in a factory 
test lab that endlessly opens and shuts a refrigerator door 
to test its durability? The activity looks silly, but it’s a key part 
of a continuous improvement program One goal of the test 
is to find out how many times the door can be opened and 
closed before something fails The more important objective, 
though, is to identify the weak points: are they the hinges, 
the gaskets, the magnets that hold the door closed, or some 
less\-visible part? The factory then tweaks the design of the 
least\-robust components or makes them from stronger 
materials Often these adjustments produce major 
improvements in product life and quality at a low cost

The same principle applies to IT security organizations If you 
identify what is holding back effective security, you can prioritize 
strengthening those weak links You might try vulnerability 
scanning, penetration testing, and… asking people on the 
front lines 

That’s why every year we query security professionals about 
the factors that inhibit their organizations from adequately 
defending themselves against cyberthreats (see Figure 31\) 

The biggest barriers to successful defense continue to be “Low 
security awareness among employees” (3 57 on a scale of 1 to 
5\) and “Lack of skilled personnel” (3 55\) Those two have been 
trading places at the top of the list for several years In fact, it has 
become abundantly clear that people problems – training and 
hiring – are bigger obstacles than any single technical challenge 

Although the exact order of the other factors has varied in 
recent years, the general picture has remained the same Our 
respondents are particularly concerned about “Too much data 
to analyze” (3 46\), “Poor integration/interoperability between 
security solutions” (3 45\), and “Poor/insufficient automation of 
threat detection and response processes” (3 43\) 

We can also learn a lot from the factors near the bottom of 
the list It appears that few cybersecurity groups are suffering 
from ignorant or indifferent management “Lack of management 
support/awareness” and “Lack of budget” are in the third\-
from\-last and last places It is also worth noting that “Too 
many false positives” has fallen to second\-to\-last We think that 
problem is being tamed by improvements in security analytics, 
possibly with the help of new applications of AI 

When we compare these results to our last survey’s, we see 
another sign that IT security professionals are feeling better For 
the second straight year, their level of concern went down for 
every single category of inhibitor covered in this question Our 
Security Concern Index, which is the combined average of the 
scores for all 10 of the factors, fell a substantial 15, down to 3 43 
That’s the lowest level since the 2019 CDR (see Figure 33\)

Figure 34: Factors that would improve job satisfaction in the IT security organization.

A running theme in this report is the shortage of skilled 
cybersecurity personnel (page 15\) and its impact on organizations’ 
ability to adequately defend themselves against cyberthreats 
(page 30\) 

Well, when we talk about problems, we like to suggest solutions 
So this year we added a question to our survey about factors 
that would improve job satistfaction among IT security staff, 
potentially improving recruiting and retention (see Figure 34\) 

The item selected most often was cybersecurity training and 
certification, which was cited by 51 9% of the respondents 
Cybersecurity personnel value ongoing training because it 
enables them to keep up with new security technologies and 
concepts so that they can do their jobs better (and be rewarded 
for better performance) 

Not surprisingly, increased compensation was also a high 
priority, at number two (43 4%)

But budget\-conscious security leaders take note: there are ways 
to make your team happier without breaking the bank In fact, 
“soft” rewards were third and fourth on the list Work schedule 
flexibility was selected by 39 6% of the respondents, and job 
performance recognitions/awards by 36 8% 

Other incentives frequently selected included increased 
budget for security tools and/or services (31 6%), more career 
advancement opportunities (31 3%), a part\-time or full\-time 
work\-from\-home policy (29 9%), and improved healthcare 
coverage and other benefits (29 4%) 

Here’s the takeaway When it comes to improving job 
satisfaction and staff retention, soft incentives like training, 
flexible schedules, and recognition are at least as influential 
as increased compensation and traditional benefits

Figure 36: Percentage of organizations with rising security budgets.

You might think that slowing economic growth in certain parts 
of the world and large layoffs in some industries would cause IT 
security budget growth to slow or reverse in at least a few sectors 
in the coming year But on the contrary, survey respondents 
pretty much across the board are expecting healthy, even record 
IT security budget growth 

The percentage of IT security groups predicting an increase in 
their budget in the year ahead has gone up every year since we 
started conducting our survey except for one (2021, because of 
COVID) This year that figure reached a new height: 88 7% (see 
Figure 36\) Only a tiny minority (3 0%) are expecting their budget 
to go down in 2024 The rest (8 3%) think their budget will stay 
about the same 

Let’s think about that for a moment Leaving aside general 
economic trends, in any given year a significant percentage 
of businesses and government agencies retrench because of 
competition, reduced funding, higher interest rates, increasing raw 
material prices, supply chain problems, post\-merger cost cutting, 
bad management decisions, and innumerable other issues Yet 
97% are coming up with the cash to maintain or increase their 
cybersecurity budgets Clearly, top management and boards of 
directors have gotten the message that IT security is a top priority 
and an area where they absolutely must keep getting better 

In addition, the average (mean) increase in IT security budgets 
reached a record this year: 5 7% That compares favorably with 
increases of 5 3% last year and 4 6% the year before (see Figure 
37\) Not only have budgets been going up recently, they have 
been rising at a faster rate

Also, expected budget increases are fairly consistent across 
major industries (ranging from 5 0% in education to 6 4% in 
finance – see Figure 38\) and across company sizes (from 5 5% 
for organizations with more than 25,000 employees to 6 0% 
for organizations with 10,000 to 25,000 – see Figure 39\) 

Finally, among organizations expecting an increase, more than 
half (54 6%) anticipate budget growth between 5% and 10% 
And about one in five (19 9%) are predicting an increase of 
10% or more (Figure 40\)

Table 1: Network security technologies in use and planned for acquisition.

Network security remains a cornerstone of IT security True, we 
no longer believe it can keep out all the bad guys, all the time 
We know some will get through by exploiting vulnerabilities, 
or careless users, or insecure code, or something else But strong 
network security solutions:

 Block a large percentage of scans and attacks, including 

most of the less\-sophisticated ones

 Collect data about attack\-related events that is essential 

for incident response and remediation

 Frustrate some threat actors and cause them to turn their 

attention to easier targets

So, if you are a security professional, it is helpful to know the 
network security technologies your peers are using today and 
the ones they plan to deploy in the near future 

At first glance, the most striking finding in Table 1 is the sharp 
drop by “Advanced threat prevention (sandboxing, ML/AI)” from 
first place last year to seventh place this year in the “currently 
in use” column The percentage of organizations with these 
products installed is still substantial – 52 0% – but it’s down from 
56 8% in the last survey However, we are pretty sure that security 
groups are not disappointed with this class of technology 
Instead, capabilities like sandboxing and AI\-driven malware 
analysis are being incorporated into broader network security 
solutions rather than being deployed as separate products

“So which network security technology is the 

new king of the hill? That would be secure web 

gateway (SWG) Over the last four years, SWG has 

jumped from seventh place, to fifth place, to third 

place, and now to first place on our list ”

So, which network security technology is the new king of the 
hill? That would be secure web gateway (SWG) As enterprises 
expand their web\-based interactions with customers, suppliers, 
business partners, and government agencies, they need to 
filter, block, and monitor more suspicious web traffic based on 
corporate policies This scenario has made SWG a rising star 
among network security technologies Over the last four years, 
it has jumped from seventh place, to fifth place, to third place, 
and now to first place on our list It is currently installed in 57 8% 
of organizations 

Four other network security technologies are in use in at least 
55% of organizations 

Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) continue 
to be a mainstay for detecting a wide variety of network\-borne 
attacks Installations rose 3 7% since the last survey, reaching 

56 8% Secure email gateway (SEG) technology plays a critical 
role identifying and blocking emails that contain malicious 
content and dangerous attachments It is in use in 56 7% of 
enterprises 

Data loss (or leak) prevention (DLP) focuses on preventing 
sensitive information from leaving the network Network access 
control (NAC) ensures external systems can’t log onto secure 
networks unless they meet specific requirements, for example, 
having up\-to\-date operating systems and several security 
solutions installed and running DLP and NAC have reached the 
level of “must have” security solutions, in use in 55 8% and 55 4% 
of organizations, respectively These figures represent increases 
of 4 6% and 4 5% compared to the previous survey 

What network security technologies are most often planned for 
acquisition over the next 12 months? Next\-generation firewall 
(NGFW) was cited most often (41 8%), followed by deception 
technology/distributed honeypots at 40 6% Deception solutions 
create fake computing environments, complete with network 
segments, user accounts, devices and servers, applications, 
databases, and file stores, and observe how threat actors try 
to find and exfiltrate data They divert attackers away from real 
information assets and give security teams front\-row seats to 
observe their techniques

Table 2: Endpoint security technologies in use and planned for acquisition.

Threat actors and security solution vendors are struggling for 
control of endpoints and the applications that run on them While 
once defenders were mostly concerned with detecting malware 
files, now they also must worry about fileless malware and other 
threats that inject malicious code into registries and legitimate 
applications, use scripts and native utilities to launch attacks, and 
gain administrator privileges to disable security features 

Among endpoint security solutions currently in use, basic 
anti\-virus/anti\-malware products remain by far the most common 
(see Table 2\) They examine files to see if they match the signature 
of known malware, and they are employed in more than 
two\-thirds of the organizations in our survey Of course, we’re 
pretty sure 100% of organizations scan for malware on endpoints, 
but increasingly those capabilities are included as one component 

of EDR and EPP solutions In fact, the percentage of organizations 
running standalone basic anti\-malware packages has declined 
from 74 2% two years ago, to 72 6% last year, to 70 3% in the 
current survey 

The second most frequently installed endpoint security 
technology is endpoint data loss (or leak) protection (DLP) 
Products in this field examine outgoing emails and documents 
to determine if they contain sensitive information such as 
financial account numbers, Social Security numbers, and other 
PII and intellectual property They then apply policies to take 
actions like blocking the export of the information or encrypting 
it before transmission Endpoint DLP is currently installed at 
59 1% of organizations, up 3 0% from the previous survey

In third and fourth places are endpoint detection and response 
(EDR) and endpoint protection platform (EPP) technologies EDR 
solutions combine a variety of tools to monitor endpoints and 
detect malware and events associated with attacks EPP solutions 
usually include EDR features plus additional capabilities for 
analysis and threat hunting EDR and EPP solutions are installed 
in 57 7% and 54 9% percent of organizations, respectively 

The fifth technology in the currently in use column is “Browser 
or Internet isolation/micro\-virtualization ” Products in this area 
typically run browser or application sessions in an isolated space 

so that users can visit websites and open emails and documents 
without allowing attackers to access their computers or mobile 
devices This is an up\-and\-coming technology; it actually showed 
the biggest gain in installations among endpoint security 
offerings, increasing by 3 8% to reach 54 7% 

The leaders in the “planned for acquisition” area were deception 
technology/honeypot and digital forensics, planned by 44 7% 
and 38 1% of organizations, respectively

This year there are three application and data security technologies 
that we would characterize as must\-haves because they are 
in use in at least 60% of organizations: database firewall, web 
application firewall (WAF), and API gateway and protection 
products (see Table 3\) 

Database firewall and WAF each moved up a notch, from second 
and third last year to first and second this year Both saw the 
percentage of installations increase: the former increased by 
2 7% to 62 8% and the latter jumped by 5 4% to 60 8% The 
heightened popularity reflects a growing interest by security 

professionals in monitoring and protecting individual databases 
and web applications 

Solutions to control traffic through APIs fell from first to third 
place on the list But that change was due to increased use of 
database firewalls and WAFs Installations of API gateways and 
protection solutions stayed about the same, declining slightly 
from 60 6% to 60 0% With an increasing amount of application 
traffic flowing through APIs, we expect these solutions to gain 
new adherents over the coming years

The technologies in the fourth through sixth positions retained the

Bot management is not installed as often as the other applications 
in this sector, but it is the leader in planned acquisitions, at 43 7% 
Controlling traffic from bots is a priority because of their use in 
ransomware, spam, DDoS attacks, and other threats 

Other technologies widely planned for acquisition this year 
include third\-party code analysis, file integrity/activity monitoring 
(FIM/FAM), and application security testing (SAST/DAST/IAST) 

We now turn to our final table in this survey, which covers current 
use and planned acquisition of security management and 
operations technologies (page 43\)

For the third year running, Active Directory protection is the 
security management and operations technology most widely 
in use, at 56 7% of organizations (see Table 4\) Active Directory 
manages identity information about people, and increasingly 
also about non\-human “users” such as IoT devices, industrial 
control systems, and modularized software services Attacks 
on Active Directory are picking up In addition, organizations 
implementing zero trust frameworks need to feel confident 
about using identity information in Active Directory (or 
equivalent enterprise directories) to assess how much access 

to resources each user account should be given These reasons 
add up to making Active Directory protection a critical enabler 
of identity management 

The old warhorse, patch management, moved from fourth 
place in the last survey to second place in this one It is in use in 
55 9% of organizations (up from 50 5% last year) We think a lot 
of renewed interest in patch management comes from the need 
to prevent ransomware gangs and other cybercriminals from 
infiltrating networks through unpatched third\-party devices and 
software, a la the SolarWinds hack 

2024 Cyberthreat Defense Report

In third place is security configuration management (SCM), 
installed in 54 6% of organizations With more and more 
security applications and devices enforcing more and more 
regulatory and company policies, it is very important to keep 
security configurations straight And of course, when policies 
are changed, you want to be able to deploy those changes 
quickly across your entire computing environment 

Other security management and operations technologies in use 
in more than half of organizations are cyber risk quantification/
scorecard (54 1%), security information and event management 
(SIEM) (53 2%), vulnerability assessment/management (VA/VM) 
(51 3%), and penetration testing/attack simulation software 
(50 3%) 

The leaders in the “Planned for Acquisition” category are 
“Advanced security analytics,” “Full packet capture and analysis,” 
“Threat intelligence platforms (TIP) or services,” and “Security 
orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)” solutions 

“For the third year running, Active Directory 

protection is the security management and

Benefits of DevSecOps Practices

Which of the following have been the biggest benefits of DevSecOps practices 
for your organization? (Select up to three )

We returned to a question about DevSecOps practices last 
asked in the 2021 CDR DevSecOps (a term that combines 
“development,” “security,” and “operations”) refers to integrating 
security design, security features, and security testing into Agile 
application development and deployment processes Examples 
include introducing security requirements in the design phase 
of applications; adding security features to the code during the 
main development process instead of trying to retrofit them into 
nearly finished applications; and ensuring that new applications, 
updates, and patches are rigorously tested for security 
defects These practices both improve security and speed up 
development and deployment cycles 

At least, that is the theory What have been the most important 
benefits in practice? And have those changed over the last three 
years? We’re glad you asked 

There hasn’t been much change at the top of the list The 
two benefits cited most often, “Increased speed of deploying 
application updates” and “Increased speed of deploying new 
applications” are the same in the 2024 CDR as they were three 
years ago (see Figure 41\) The frequency with which they 
were selected changed only slightly, from 47 2% to 45 8% for 
accelerating updates, and from 45 8% to 45 6% for speeding 
up new applications 

It’s not surprising that these are popular benefits because, 
let’s be frank, most application development teams are more 
motivated by quickly delivering new functional features than 
by addressing security requirements 

However, we see evidence of one noteworthy change in 
attitudes between the 2021 and 2024 surveys: respondents 
selecting “Fewer application security vulnerabilities/risks” as a

big benefit jumped 5 5%, from 38 5% to 44 0% (which is 
only slightly behind the top two benefits) In other words, 
development groups are acknowledging that DevSecOps 
practices lead to significant improvements in security that 
benefit organizations roughly as much as accelerating the 
delivery of updates and new applications 

The final two benefits on our list, “Improved relations between 
DevOps and SecOps personnel” and “Reduced costs,” continue 
to be cited as benefits by many organizations, but somewhat 
less frequently than in the 2021 survey

Our data also captures the percentage of organizations that have

confirms their popularity By industry, DevSecOps practices are 
implemented most widely in retail (94 0%), healthcare (92 9%),

Percentage of Security Applications and Services Delivered Via the Cloud

What percentage of your information security applications and services is delivered 
via the cloud?

To compare current responses, we revived another question 
from earlier surveys: “What percentage of your information 
security applications and services is delivered via the cloud?”

The mean across all respondents increased from 35 7% in the 
2020 CDR to 40 1% in this one (see Figure 44\) That result is 
not surprising, given the long\-term trend toward delivery of 
more applications and services of all kinds via the cloud Not 
only does cloud delivery relieve enterprises of the burdens 
of hosting software on their own premises, cloud\-based 
applications are much more scalable, allowing them to 
expedite handling of compute\-intensive tasks (of which 
there are many in security)

Differences are also apparent across industries (see Figure 46\) 
Manufacturers and retailers use cloud\-based services the most 
(45 7% and 43 8%, respectively) Financial institutions and 
government agencies are lagging adopters (37 1% and 33 6%), 
no doubt because many are subject to regulations that require 
sensitive information (access credentials as well as data) to 
remain on premises

services are coming through the cloud, a range of only 0 7% The 
outlier was organizations with 500\-999 employees The figure

How Organizations Leverage External Threat Intelligence

How does your organization leverage external threat intelligence? (Select all that apply )

To improve our ability to detect indicators

To prioritize vulnerabilities and exposures to
reduce our attack surface

To uncover threat actors impersonating our

Figure 48: How organizations are leveraging external threat intelligence.

We have observed more and more cybersecurity vendors 
advertising the fact that their solutions employ threat intelligence 
for tasks like making better context\-based authentication 
decisions and automatically prioritizing alerts But what about 
enterprise IT security groups? We wanted to know how they are 
leveraging external threat intelligence (by “external,” we mean 
sourced outside of the organization’s own infrastructure) 

The most common use of threat intelligence is “To improve 
our ability to detect indicators of attack (IoAs) and indicators of 
compromise (IoCs),” cited by 55 4% of respondents (see Figure 48\) 
This result reflects the fact that operational and technical threat 
intelligence sources, such as databases of vulnerabilities, malware 
signatures, and indicators of attacks, are critical raw materials 
for many enterprise security products (such as firewalls, IDS/IPS 
systems, anti\-malware products, and security analytics tools) 

2024 Cyberthreat Defense Report

49

Table of Contents IntroductionResearch HighlightsCurrent Security PosturePerceptions and ConcernsCurrent and Future InvestmentsPractices and StrategiesThe Road AheadSurvey DemographicsResearch MethodologyResearch SponsorsAbout CyberEdge GroupSection 4: Practices and Strategies

Number two on the list is “To prioritize vulnerabilities and 
exposures to reduce our attack surface” (49 5%) Threat 
intelligence informs security teams about newly discovered 
weaknesses they need to look for in their infrastructure 
And because not all threats are equally serious or affect 
everyone, intelligence helps prioritize the ones to focus 
on for detection and remediation 

The third major use of threat intelligence is “To uncover threat 
actors impersonating our websites and social media accounts” 
(46 5%) This relates to “brand protection” or “digital brand 
protection ” Brand protection involves detecting and taking 
down websites, social media accounts, and mobile apps 
resembling an organization’s real digital assets These fake 
assets are created by cybercriminals to defraud customers, 
steal account numbers and access credentials, or sell counterfeit 
goods Threats to the brand also involve social media posts and 
accounts created by hackers who impersonate the organization’s 
employees to spread disinformation It takes specialized skills 
and tools to find these websites and social media accounts, so 
most enterprises that are worried about them rely on external 
threat intelligence suppliers 

Other important use cases are obtaining intelligence about 
vulnerabilities and compromises at vendors and other supply 
chain partners (valuable information for third\-party risk 
management, or TPRM), and understanding threat actor groups’ 
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) (critical intelligence 
for incident response and threat hunting) 

Discovering data breaches and stolen credentials on the dark 
web is not as common as the other use cases in this list However, 
we think more organizations will make use of that kind of threat 
intelligence in the future 

Our data also shows that external threat intelligence is clearly 
a must\-have Almost all organizations in our survey (97 3%, to 
be precise) are leveraging it for one or more of these use cases 
(see Figure 49\)

Board Members with a Cybersecurity Background

Does at least one member of your company’s board of directors have a cybersecurity background?

There have been a lot of stories in the press about the elevation 
of cybersecurity to a board\-level issue There are also discussions 
about IT security getting “a seat at the table” with upper 
management and boards But is that really happening?

The short answer: yes, a lot In our survey, 62 2% of respondents 
at organizations that have a board of directors said that at least 
one member has a cybersecurity background (see Figure 50\) 

Do security professionals think it makes a difference to have a 
board member with cybersecurity experience? Our data shows 
that most do Of the respondents who said their organization did 
not have one, roughly four of five said it would help Only 19 6% 
said they didn’t think it would make a difference (see Figure 51\) 

The fact that three out of five boards include a person with 
knowledge about cybersecurity challenges and technology is 
extremely important It means there is likely to be a champion 
among the directors for cybersecurity budget and staffing 
requests, and someone who can help non\-technical board 
members understand the issues and trade\-offs involved This 
scenario also improves communication in the other direction 
by providing someone who can help IT groups better understand 
the point of view of company leaders and the role of cybersecurity 
in supporting the organization’s business initiatives 

The percentage of organizations with cybersecurity experience 
on their boards differs significantly across countries (see Figure 
52\) The leaders are Brazil (90 3%), Mexico (87 9%), and China 
(86 0%), while the laggards are Germany (51 4%), Italy (43 8%), 
and Canada (43 5%)

The final question in this survey examines how many organizations 
have implemented, or plan to implement, nine emerging IT 
security technologies and architectures (see Figure 54\) 

By the way, you may have noticed that eight of the nine 
technologies and architectures discussed here have names so 
long that we almost always refer to them by their acronyms 

The technology farthest along in deployment is identity 
threat detection and response ITDR solutions protect identity 
information and identity stores that are central to identity 
management and zero trust security ITDR is currently in 
production in 42 4% of organizations, and implementation 
is in progress in 35 0% more 

Second on the list is SaaS security posture management 
SSPM products monitor and manage security issues in SaaS 
applications They are in production in 40 7% of organizations 
and are being implemented in an additional 33 6%

Next come two technologies that enhance security in cloud 
environments A cloud\-native application protection platform 
(CNAPP) combines a variety of capabilities for monitoring and 
managing security of cloud\-based applications, and promoting 
DevSecOps practices for developing secure cloud applications 
A cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) 
product manages identities and entitlements for cloud\-based 
applications and services CNAPP and CIEM solutions are in 
production in 40 2% and 39 8% of organizations, and are being 
implemented in 31 9% and 36 9% more, respectively 

Passwordless authentication (hey, no acronym needed!), as the 
name suggests, provides authentication without relying on 
passwords, usually through the use of biometrics and special 
keys Eliminating passwords improves security dramatically 
while making life easier for users Passwordless authentication 
is currently in production in 39 5% of organizations and 
implementation is in progress at 30 0% more 

Secure access service edge architectures combine SD\-WAN 
networking services with a variety of security tools to ensure 
secure communications for distributed offices and users The 
in\-production and being\-implemented figures for SASE are 
39 1% and 35 6% 

Risk\-based vulnerability management (RBVM) solutions not only 
discover but also prioritize and remediate unpatched systems, 
misconfigurations, and other vulnerabilities Of the organizations 
in this survey, 37 9% are using RBVM now and 34 0% are working 
on deployment 

Zero trust network access (ZTNA) refers to technologies and 
architectures that assess all access requests based on multiple 
risk factors and control access based on the principle of least 
privilege ZTNA frameworks are currently deployed in 35 8% of 
organizations and implementation is in progress in 38 1% more 

Extended detection and response (XDR) products combine 
multiple security tools that work together to detect attacks 
and provide data so organizations can respond faster They 
are in production in 34 8% of organizations and are being 
implemented in 35 8% more 

One note on reading Figure 54 Because the chart sequences the 
items in this question based on their “currently in production” 
percentage, some of the technologies and architectures getting 
the most press attention from security professionals appear 
in the middle or near the bottom of the list However, the 
picture changes if you look at their rates for “implementation in 
progress ” For example, ZTNA has the most implementations in 
progress, with XDR and SASE in the third and fourth positions by 
that measure

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. 
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. 
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. 
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun. 

 – Lyrics from Time by Pink Floyd

We now have 10 years of Cyberthreat Defense Reports behind us 
CyberEdge published the first one in the spring of 2014 Every year 
since then we have introduced some new questions and retired 
others, but we kept a core set of topics that have carried through 

since 2014 We thought it would be interesting to see how the 
answers to three of those questions have changed over the decade, 
and what those changes tell us about the state of cyber defense 

How many times do you estimate that your organization’s global network has been compromised 
by a successful cyberattack within the past 12 months?

This has been one of the cornerstone questions of the CDR since 
the beginning The chart at right (also presented as Figure 1 on 
page 7\) shows how many organizations have experienced one 
or more attacks, and how many have been victimized by six or 
more There was a strong upward trend from 2014 through 2021, 
indicating that threat actors were pulling ahead in their arms 
race with defenders during that period Then, in the 2022 CDR 
the trend lines flattened, and have decreased over the last two 
years Although successful attacks remain at a historically high 
level, the data demonstrates an extremely important turning 
point (assuming the downward trend persists) 

At least one successful attack

What is the likelihood that your organization’s network will become compromised 
by a successful cyberattack in 2024?

The chart at right (also shown as Figure 5 on page 9\) is about 
expectations for the coming year In retrospect, it is amazing 
how optimistic we were in 2014: only 8 5% of respondents 
thought a successful attack was “very likely”! However, from 
2015 to 2022 expectations rapidly adjusted to the reality of the 
increasing successes of threat actors Now the tide appears to 
be turning, although if we compare Figure 1 (actual successful 
attacks) with Figure 5 (expected successful attacks), it looks like 
expectations for improvement may be overshooting reality

Figure 55: Perceived security posture by IT domain: On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate your organization’s overall security posture 
(ability to defend against cyberthreats) in each of the following IT components. 

Figure 55 contains a lot of data – the perceived security 
posture across 13 IT domains for 10 years But it points to 
a few interesting patterns:

 Confidence in security posture moved up dramatically 

between 2014 and 2020 Since then, various domains have 
changed places on the list, but overall levels of confidence 
in the security posture of different domains have remained 
about the same 

 The range of scores has narrowed dramatically between 
2014 and 2024 In 2014 scores ranged between 2 77 and 
3 64, a span of 97 In 2024 the range is between 3 88 and 
4 11, a span of only 23 We think the reason is that security 
groups have been investing in products and processes to 
shore up the weakest areas, as well as making improvements 
in technologies to protect mobile and remote devices and 
individual workstations

AI Swords and Shields

New Regulations Taking Effect

The impact of artificial intelligence is just now starting to be felt 
There is no doubt that AI technologies will transform existing 
cyber battlegrounds between threat actors and security teams 
Our survey includes input from security professionals about likely 
uses and abuses of AI (see pages 21\-26\) However, it is very likely 
AI will also have effects that few people, if any, can anticipate We 
are paying very close attention to these developments, and so 
should everyone concerned with cybersecurity 

AI and Cybersecurity Jobs

All of us should be asking ourselves, “Could AI do my job?” 

Most security professionals should not be overly concerned, 
for two reasons:

 Many cybersecurity jobs require knowledge, judgment, 
and experience that cannot be replicated by AI, at least 
not yet 

 There is still a significant shortage of experienced cybersecurity 

people (see pages 15 and 30\), so even in areas where AI 
boosts productivity, the immediate effect will be to bring 
supply and demand into balance, rather than to cause layoffs 

However, some cybersecurity jobs involve tasks that AI can perform 
very effectively Examples are collecting and classifying data, looking 
for vulnerabilities in configurations and code, and carrying out 
incident response playbooks and remediation processes 

There is little doubt that security groups will look to leverage AI 
in these areas But when that happens, we believe they should 
make a strong effort to retrain affected security professionals so 
they can fill vacancies in roles that AI can’t take over Retraining 
will be cost\-effective (not to mention good for morale) compared 
to laying off people in one area while running expensive 
searches to hire outsiders 

Enough about probabilities and contingencies Let’s talk about 
some inevitabilities A bunch of new regulations and industry 
standards (or major revisions) have come into force recently or 
will do so soon Among them:

U S Securities and Exchange Commission rules requiring 
public companies to make additional disclosures about the 
nature, scope, and timing of material cybersecurity incidents, as 
well as to report annually on their cybersecurity risk management, 
strategy, and governance The SEC also adopted rules requiring 
foreign private issuers to make comparable disclosures The new 
rules go into effect at different times in 2024 

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI 
DSS) v4 0 includes a load of new requirements for ecommerce 
companies, financial institutions, and other firms that handle 
payment card data The new rules relate to secure authentication, 
identity and access management, encryption, web application 
protection, risk management, compliance testing and reporting, 
and other areas Some of the new requirements become active 
on March 31, 2024, and others on March 31, 2025 

The European Union Network and Information Security 2 
(NIS2\) Directive expands the scope of EU cybersecurity rules 
to cover more companies, requires more incident reporting, 
and adds requirements for companies to address security risks 
related to supply chains and supplier relationships, among 
other changes In addition, top executives will have to take 
responsibility for their organization’s cybersecurity maturity 
EU member states will have until October 17 to pass national 
legislation to enforce the provisions 

The EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) covers 
cybersecurity and risk management for financial institutions 
and their third\-party service providers operating in the EU 
A new draft of technical standards extends rules covering 
protection, detection, containment, recovery, and repair 
capabilities for information and communication technology 
The compliance deadline is January 17, 2025

These and other regulatory updates, and the increased 
transparency mandated by some of them, will force many 
organizations to add or upgrade security technologies 
and processes 

 Financial institutions involved in funding or handling cash 

flows for the opposing country

 Companies that supply the opposing country’s DIB

 Media and communications outlets that support the 

Hot War, Cold War, Proxy War, Cyberwar

opposing country

We sincerely hope that none of what we are about to discuss 
happens But today there is a risk that an active military conflict, 
or a behind\-the\-scenes struggle between nations, or the 
activities of rebels or terrorists supported by a regional power, 
will spill over to active fighting in cyberspace 

The nature and dimensions of such cyberwars are hard to 
predict But if they occur, they are likely to involve a combination 
of disruption and disinformation Also, the “blast radius” could 
be much wider than most people realize 

There are quite a few potential targets:

In the opposing country

 Political leaders 

 Military organizations 

 Companies in the defense industrial base (DIB)

 Transportation and infrastructure firms

 Media and communications outlets 

 Financial institutions

In other countries

 Political leaders who back the opposing country

 Military organizations that funnel weapons and ammunition 

to the opposing country

 Transportation and infrastructure firms that carry supplies 

to the opposing country

 Ecommerce companies, retailers, fast food and packaged 

food companies, energy producers, telecom and technology 
firms, pharmaceutical companies, automakers, professional 
services firms, arts and entertainment organizations, etc , 
which are perceived as supporting the opposing country, its 
military, or its ideology 

In short, nearly every large organization, everywhere, even with 
no obvious link to politics or defense work, could become a target 

What are the implications? Organizations of all types should 
look carefully at the possibility that they might be targeted by 
participants in a hot, cold, or proxy war They should consider 
what regions, what types of threats (such as DDoS attacks, 
attempts to steal intellectual property, attacks on operations, 
or misinformation and propaganda spread through counterfeit 
or compromised websites and social media accounts), and 
what monetary and reputational costs could be involved Some 
organizations may only need to broaden the scope of existing 
risk management or geopolitical intelligence activities, but 
others might want to create a new working group or steering 
committee to assess the contingencies 

Again, we hope this exercise won’t be needed, but we fear that 
lack of preparation could have unexpected costs

CyberEdge developed a 27\-question, web\-based, vendor\-agnostic 
survey instrument in partnership with our research sponsors The 
survey was completed by 1,200 IT security professionals in 17 
countries and 19 industries in November 2023 The global margin 
of error for this research study (at a standard 95% confidence level) 
is 3% All results pertaining to individual countries and industries 
should be viewed as anecdotal, as their sample sizes are much 
smaller CyberEdge recommends making actionable decisions 
based on global data only 

 Constructing survey questions in a way that eliminates 

survey bias and minimizes the potential for survey fatigue 

 Only accepting completed surveys after the respondent 

has provided answers to all of the questions

 Ensuring that respondents view the survey in their native 

language (e g , English, German, French, Spanish, Japanese, 
Chinese)

 Randomizing survey responses, when possible, to prevent 

All respondents had to meet two filter criteria: (1\) they had to 
have an IT security role; and (2\) they had to be employed by a 
commercial or government organization with a minimum of 
500 global employees 

At CyberEdge, survey data quality is paramount CyberEdge goes 
to extraordinary lengths to ensure its survey data is of the highest 
caliber by following these industry best practices:

 Ensuring that the right people are being surveyed by 

(politely) exiting respondents from the survey who don’t 
meet the respondent filter criteria of the survey (e g , job 
role, job seniority, company size, industry)

 Ensuring that disqualified respondents (who do not meet 

respondent filter criteria) cannot restart the survey (from the 
same IP address) in an attempt to obtain the survey incentive

order bias

 Adding “Don’t know” (or comparable) responses, when 

possible, so respondents aren’t forced to guess at questions 
they don’t know the answer to

 Eliminating responses from “speeders” who complete the 

survey in a fraction of the median completion time

 Eliminating responses from “cheaters” who apply consistent 
patterns to their responses (e g , A,A,A,A and A,B,C,D,A,B,C,D)

 Ensuring the online survey is fully tested and easy to use on 

computers, tablets, and smartphones
