Executive Summary
Navigating identity, access, and permissions has become 
an overwhelmingly complicated challenge for security teams. 
The explosion of SaaS and the complexity of hybrid environments 
have created an intricately tangled web of permissions. 
This complexity is heightened as the extended enterprise takes 
hold, with contractors, partners, and suppliers now having access 
to sensitive company systems. The rise of non\-human identities 
is also quickly expanding the risk associated with managing access 
and permissions within organizations.
These challenges go far beyond traditional identity priorities like passwords, authentication, or ease of access. 
Critical systems and sensitive data are now at risk from overprivileged users, birthright access, orphaned and unused 
accounts, and widespread permissions sprawl. Additionally, gaining visibility into and managing user access across 
systems is often a highly manual and time\-consuming endeavor for security teams.
The 2024 Identity Security Outlook Report was conducted to shine a light on the current identity security and access 
management challenges and opportunities security leaders face. For the study, ConductorOne surveyed 523 US\-based 
IT security professionals director level and higher at companies with 250 to 10,000 employees. The results 
paint a clear picture of the technological and organizational complexity creating a new wave of identity risks. 
The study found that
 
Most organizations have experienced firsthand just how risky identity issues have become. The majority of security 
leaders said their organization has faced a cyberattack or data breach in the last 12 months due to improper 
access or overprivileged users. 
 
Complexity was cited as the number one identity security challenge today, with most organizations dealing with 
numerous SaaS apps, hybrid environments, and external entities like contractors having access to systems. 
 
Despite nearly half of respondents stating their identity strategy is hindering team productivity, risk reduction is the 
top priority for security leaders when it comes to identity and access. 
 
The concept of zero standing privileges is gaining traction and is widely viewed as an effective strategy to reduce 
access risks.

Security Leaders Face
Mounting Identity Threats 
The threat landscape has evolved significantly over the past decade. To counter rising threats, many companies have 
turned to zero trust as a guiding principle of defense. Based on the concept of never trust, always verify, businesses 
have gone to great lengths to ensure that nothing inside or outside of their environment is trusted by default.
Because zero trust has worked so well, its become much more difficult for attackers to gain access to companies 
systems via traditional methods. In response, attackers are increasingly shifting their tactics toward identity\-based 
attacks. Now, instead of breaking in, attackers are logging in to gain access to sensitive systems and data.
Improper Access Is Resulting in a High Percentage 
of Cyberattacks and Breaches
Of the security leaders surveyed for this report, 77% said their organization has suffered from instances of cyberattacks 
or data breaches in the past 12 months due to improper access or overprivileged users. 
In the past 12 months, have there been instances of cyberattacks or data breaches at your 
organization due to improper access or over\-privileged users?

Furthermore, 41% of respondents said there had been multiple instances of cyberattacks or data breaches due 
to the same improper access issues. 
Smaller businesses seem to be feeling the pain more acutely 85% of respondents at companies of 250\-500 
employees said they had experienced a breach or attack in the last 12 months.

Complex Environments 
Lead to Identity Risks 
Its clear that businesses need to find ways to reduce their identity and access attack surface. However, the complexity 
of modern technology environments has made identity security and access management an overwhelming challenge. 
SaaS Sprawl
As SaaS becomes more pervasive, it creates new layers of complexity for IT and security departments. To better 
understand the issue, the Identity Security Outlook Report asked respondents how many SaaS apps were in use across 
their company. On average, security leaders estimated 39\.5 apps in use. 
As anticipated, the results show that the larger the organization, the more SaaS applications were reportedly in use. 
Smaller companies with 250\-500 employees had 9\.2 SaaS apps in use, whereas larger companies with 5,001\-10,000 
employees had an average of 70\.4 apps. 
In your best estimation, how many SaaS applications
are currently in use across your company?

While this correlation between company size and number of SaaS apps was expected, the volume of reported SaaS apps 
was surprisingly low. For example, according to Statista, the average company used 130 SaaS apps as of 2022\.
The low reported volume of SaaS in the Identity Security Outlook Report could indicate that some organizations apps are 
not under the purview of the security team, highlighting the growing threat vector of shadow or rogue SaaS applications 
not sanctioned or managed by the security team.

Hybrid IT
Cloud migration is well underway for most organizations today, yet many still operate with some on\-premises systems. 
The majority (76%) of survey respondents indicated that their company currently has a hybrid environment. 
The survey results demonstrate that hybrid IT is the new normal. Only a small percentage of respondents (6%) said their 
environment is completely in the cloud, and only 18% stated that their companys technology environment is completely 
on premises.
How would you currently describe your companys
technology environment?
A mix of on\-premises
and cloud 41%
Completely on\-premises 18%
Completely cloud 6%
Mostly cloud 19%

Interestingly, of the respondents who experienced multiple instances of cyberattacks or breaches due to improper 
access or overprivileged users in the past 12 months, 55% said their companys technology environment was mostly 
or completely on\-premises. This percentage is notably higher compared to the 35% of respondents from the broader 
survey who reported the same.
Extended Enterprise
The concept of the extended enterprise continues to gain traction, as the vast majority of companies now bring data, 
users, and systems from third\-party organizations into their own environments.
Granting third\-party users access to internal systems can be important for collaboration and productivity, but it can also 
put sensitive data and systems in jeopardy. Because a business cannot control an external entitys own security protocols 
or tools, this practice may open the business up to increased risk. 
Nearly all security leaders (97%) reported that their company works with external entities like contractors, partners, 
or suppliers who have access to their various systems, applications, andor resources. 
More than half (51%) of respondents said their company extensively involves external entities, while 38% say these 
contractors, partners or suppliers are limited to specific roles.

The study also found a correlation between the number of cyberattacks due to improper access in the last year and the 
extensive involvement of external entities. 
For example, of the respondents who experienced multiple instances of cyberattacks or breaches due to improper access 
or overprivileged users in the past year, 76% said their company extensively involves external entities. Of those who only 
experienced isolated attacks, that number decreased to 39%. 
Of the respondents who did not experience any breach or attack, only 24% said their company extensively involves 
external entities. This indicates that the involvement of external entities could result in greater risk for the organization.

Non\-Human Identities
Also known as machine identities, non\-human identities such as service accounts, API tokens, OAuth tokens, 
and more are becoming a significant challenge for security teams. Just like human users, these non\-human 
identities can have privileged access to an organizations system and data. 
Therefore, its no wonder that the majority (81%) of respondents stated they are concerned about non\-human 
identities and the risk they pose to their company, with 38% stating they are very concerned. 
The number of very concerned respondents increased to 56% across those who had experienced multiple 
instances of cyberattacks due to improper access in the past year.

Top Identity and Access 
Management Challenges 
Given the high degree of complexity associated with SaaS, hybrid IT, the extended enterprise, and non\-human identities, 
its no surprise that complexity of existing systems was cited as the top identity and access management challenge by 
47% of survey respondents. 
This was followed by employees resistance to change (38%), limitations due to the tools or solutions available (33%), 
and executives resistance to change (32%). Other challenges include lack of expertise (31%), employees ignoring 
policies (30%), lack of budget (28%), and lack of team bandwidth (26%).

Complexity of existing systems was cited as the top challenge across all company sizes. However, this was not the 
case among respondents who experienced multiple instances of cyberattacks or breaches due to improper access 
or overprivileged users in the past 12 months. For this group, executives resistance to change (46%) and employees 
resistance to change (42%) were cited as the top challenges.

Impact of Identity Security Strategies on Team Productivity
In years past, identity and access management safeguards have been notoriously viewed as a hindrance to team 
productivity. Employees have long begrudged additional layers of passwords, multifactor authentication, and other 
access protocols as hoops they must jump through to access their companys critical systems.
While many identity and access management tools have vastly improved the employee experience, some organizations 
are still stuck in the age\-old battle between security and productivity.
This is evidenced by the nearly half (47%) of survey respondents who reported that their companys identity security 
strategy and access policies hinder team productivity, with 23% citing a significant hindrance on productivity. Smaller 
organizations (250\-500 employees) were more likely to state that their policies significantly hinder productivity, at 42%.

Respondents who did not experience any instances of breach or attack due to improper access were far less likely 
to cite a significant hindrance on productivity, at only 4%. This could indicate that organizations whose identity security 
strategies prioritize a seamless user experience may be more likely to achieve employee compliance with internal 
policies, thus reducing their overall risk. 
Encouragingly, 38% of respondents said their current identity security strategies and access policies have actually 
improved team productivity.

Current Processes
to Manage Risk 
With a wide range of identity and access management challenges to contend with, security leaders must take 
steps to reduce risk and stay ahead of attacks without introducing friction into the business all while staying 
on budget.
Auditing User Access
Auditing user access and permissions is a critical step for organizations to maintain compliance, reduce standing 
privileges, and improve security. 
Nearly all (95%) of respondents responded they are confident in their companys ability to audit identities and access 
rights across all systems. Larger companies (5,001\-10,000 employees) were somewhat less confident than their smaller\-
size counterparts, at 89%.
More than half (52%) of respondents said their organization audits user permissions regularly at least once a quarter 
 with another 26% stating their user permissions audits are either continuous or triggered based on events.

Managing User Access and Permissions
Granting and revoking user access can be a tedious process, especially as the number of systems and users grows along 
with the business. 
When asked who manages permissions for their companys systems, applications, and resources, 46% stated a central 
IT department, 15% said individual departmental admins, and 38% said permissions are managed by a mix of both IT 
and department admins. 
When it comes to automated vs. manual processes for managing user access and permissions, respondents are evenly 
split: 50% described their process as manual, while the other 50% described their process as automated. However, 29% 
of respondents described their process as highly manual and time\-consuming, compared to only 13% who stated their 
process was fully automated and efficient. 
How would you describe the process of managing user access and permissions
across various systems in your organization?

Of the respondents who experienced multiple instances of cyberattacks or breaches due to improper access or 
overprivileged users in the past 12 months, almost half (49%) stated their process was highly manual and time 
consuming. This could indicate that manual processes might introduce error or inaccuracy, leading to greater risk. 
Among the respondents who said their process is automated, 75% stated their process still requires manual oversight. 
This could point toward the trend of human\-in\-the\-loop (HITL) automation, in which humans are involved in automation 
workflows at key decision\-making points to ensure accuracy. However, this could also indicate that the automation 
in use among these respondents is not sophisticated and still requires significant human intervention.

Identifying Privileged Users and Orphaned Accounts
Overprivileged users, orphaned accounts, and unused accounts represent a growing security risk that must be managed. 
Overprivileged users have more access rights than necessary for their roles, whereas orphaned accounts are those that 
are not deactivated when an employee leaves the organization. Unused accounts include permissions held by users who 
either arent using them or no longer need access to certain systems. In these scenarios, the accounts can become easy 
targets for attack. 
More than half (61%) of respondents reported that their company has a strictly enforced policy to manage and restrict 
overprivileged users. However, 32% said that enforcement of their policy is inconsistent, while 7% say they either dont 
have a policy in place or their policy is still under development. 
When asked about their process to identify and deactivate unused or orphaned accounts, 64% of respondents said they 
have an automated process in place. 29% of respondents said their process is still manual, while 6% either dont have a 
process or are still developing one.

Measuring Identity Risk
Despite advances in technology and processes, measuring identity risk still remains a challenge for many organizations 
today. In fact, one in four respondents (25%) stated they are not currently measuring identity risk across their company. 
The top metrics currently used to measure company\-wide identity risk include the percent of access that is covered by 
multifactor authentication (67%), percent of privileged access that is time\-constrained or just\-in\-time access (56%), 
and time to deprovision sensitive access (43%).

Budgets Increase to Meet 
Identity and Access Needs
Amid the reality of economic uncertainty, theres been an open question about how security budgets could be impacted. 
However, smart organizations understand that security is one area that cannot be trimmed or scaled back. In todays 
environment, the reputation and viability of a business is predicated upon its ability to maintain operations and keep 
sensitive information safe. 
With this in mind, its encouraging to see that the majority (84%) of survey respondents reported either a moderate 
or significant increase in their companys budget allocation for identity and access\-related products this year.

to see no change (27%; compared to the broader survey group at 14%). 
Respondents who experienced multiple instances of attacks or breaches due to improper access were far more likely 
to see an increase in budget allocation for the upcoming year (92%) compared to those who did not experience any 
instances of attacks or breaches (69%). 
Nearly all respondents (95%) said their budget allocations for identity and access\-related products are adequate; 
however, only 38% said their budget allocations are completely adequate. 
Despite increasing budgets and respondents self\-reporting that their allocations are adequate, 73% of respondents 
still find themselves frequently or very frequently negotiating higher security budgets due to increasing security risks 
and responsibilities.

The concept of zero standing privileges (ZSP) is gaining traction among security leaders as a means of improving 
identity security and reducing risk. 
In an enterprise with ZSP in place, a user is only granted the minimum levels of access and privilege needed to complete 
a task, and only for a limited amount of time. This means that should an attacker gain entry to a users account, there 
is far less potential for them to access sensitive data and systems.
According to the Identity Security Outlook Report, 93% of security leaders stated they believe ZSP is effective at reducing 
access risks within their organization, with 52% saying its highly effective.

Conclusion
2024 Identity SecurityOutlook Report
20
The results of the 2024 Identity Security Outlook Report send a clear 
message: identity is messy. Thats because identity uniquely sits at 
the intersection of human behavior, technology, legal frameworks, 
and cybercriminal activity. As technology systems become increasingly 
complex, heterogeneous, and interconnected, the messiness of 
identity only becomes more apparent. 
Poor identity and access practices can hinder team productivity and 
result in a negative employee experience. More importantly, however, 
identity has now become a prime target for attackers. With more than 
three\-fourths of security leaders citing an identity\-related breach or 
attack in the last year alone, were now squarely in a new world order, 
one in which identity and access must be viewed and managed as a 
high\-priority security risk. 
Fortunately, there are several glimmers of hope. First, many security 
leaders are leaning into automation to ease the burden on their teams 
and improve efficiency. The majority are also benefiting from increased 
budget allocations for identity security, with most citing their new 
budgets as adequate. Finally, most security leaders recognize just how 
effective zero standing privileges can be for reducing risk. 
In the days ahead, security leaders will continue to prioritize risk 
reduction while also making efforts to boost team productivity, 
automate processes, and improve the user experience. With a more 
holistic, security\-minded approach, businesses can finally bring 
identity chaos to order.
