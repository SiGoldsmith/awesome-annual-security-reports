2024 Data 
Privacy Trends 

DataGrail’s Data Privacy Trends Report

Executive Summary

Consumers are more aware of the risks related to sharing personal 
information online. Data privacy laws are getting stricter. And data 
privacy is more important than ever, especially as GenAI becomes the 
new standard. DataGrail’s 2024 Data Privacy Trends Report shows how 
these factors are playing out on the ground and provides a benchmark 
for businesses to see how they are tracking.

Businesses are receiving more privacy requests, also known as Data 
Subject Requests (DSRs) every year; we saw a 246% increase in 
requests from 2021 to 2023\. For every one million consumer identities, 
manually processing DSRs costs about $800K. Consumers are taking 
more control over their personal data by, among other things, accessing 
it, deleting it, or requesting businesses not to sell or share it.

With this report, we hope to provide insights into how many DSRs 
businesses are getting (spoiler: it’s a lot more than last year), reveal 
which types of DSRs are most common, uncover the costs of dealing 
with privacy requests, and reveal one important area in which 
businesses risk violating the law. Legal and cultural trends mean every 
company should be taking privacy seriously, and this report can help 
you navigate this fast\-developing landscape.

Methodology

DataGrail analyzed the Data Subject Requests 
(DSRs) it helped process on behalf of 
customers from January 1 \- December 31, 
2023\. The customer set has more than 700 
million records, where a record is deﬁned as a 
single, individual record associated with a 
unique identiﬁer within a customer's database. 
To determine the cost of processing requests, 
we used Gartner’s manual processing estimate 
of $1,524 per DSR. This statistic comes from 
Gartner’s 2023 report, Market Guide for 
Subject Rights Request Automation. 

The dataset includes information from 
companies of all sizes, from startups to 
publicly traded household names. To normalize 
the data across various company sizes, we 
calculated DSRs per one million identities. For 
example, the data shows the average business 
in 2023 received 578 Access \& Deletion 
requests per 1M identities per year. Using 578 
as a benchmark, an organization with 3M 
identities can expect 1,734 Access and 
Deletion requests per year.

If we include California\-speciﬁc Do Not Sell 
requests, the numbers rise to 859 requests 

per 1M identities per year. Following the 
example above, if the organization holds 3M 
identities, the industry benchmark would be 
2,577 DSRs per year.

We found the number of DSRs a business 
receives varies greatly due to multiple factors, 
including whether the company is B2B or B2C, 
how often company privacy policies change, 
and several other factors. To account for 
variability, we used a 10% trim mean 
calculation to determine our benchmarks. A 
10% trim mean calculation excludes the 10% 
largest and 10% smallest values and takes the 
mean of the remaining 80%.

The dataset includes DSRs submitted under 
CCPA and GDPR, along with DSRs received in 
the US and globally that don’t fall under those 
regulatory umbrellas. As a United 
States\-based company, with primarily 
US\-based customers, our dataset may skew 
toward DSRs from the US.

To calculate the percentage of organizations 
not complying with the GPC standard, we 
audited more that 5,000 websites. 

What’s a DSR?
A Data Subject Request (DSR) allows an individual to request that an organization takes 
certain action over the individual’s personal data. There are several types of DSRs, but this 
report focuses on requests to access personal data, requests to delete personal data, and 
requests that a company does not sell or share personal data (“Do Not Sell” requests).

What do we mean by identity?
Mentions of an “identity” refer to information associated with a unique record of a single 
customer or employee at a company. A single “identity” accounts for one customer’s 
personal data within multiple systems across an organization.

The 2024 State 
of Data Privacy: US \& Europe

Since our 2023 report, privacy has continued to become one of the 
most important focuses for businesses across the world. This year 
has seen even more privacy legislation, data\-related legal activity, 
and awareness of privacy rights among consumers.

United States

European Union \& United Kingdom

State privacy laws: By the
end of 2023, 12 states passed “comprehensive” 
privacy laws. So far in 2024, New Jersey, New 
Hampshire, and Kentucky have joined the 
privacy club, and Maryland and Nebraska should 
be enacting such laws soon.
California privacy enforcement: In February, 
Attorney General Rob Bonta settled a California 
Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) complaint 
accusing DoorDash of unlawfully selling personal 
information. That same month, California Privacy 
Protection Agency (CPPA) also gained its 
enforcement powers, so expect more California 
action soon.
Federal privacy enforcement: Following an 
extremely busy 2023, the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) continues to push hard 
against unlawful tracking, issuing an average
of one privacy enforcement order per month 
throughout the ﬁrst quarter of 2024\.
Federal privacy bill: In early April, the US House 
of Representatives unexpectedly revealed a 
draft federal privacy law with strict rules on data 
minimization, transparency, and data sharing. 
Whether or not the American Privacy Rights Act 
(APRA) passes, the bill shows how privacy is 
becoming an increasingly crucial issue in the US.

EU court rulings: After countless GDPR 
judgments throughout 2023, the Court of 
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) began 
2024 with further important data protection 
rulings, including on:

○

Digital advertising (Case C‑604/22 
involving the Interactive Advertising 
Bureau, IAB) 
The wide scope of the GDPR (Case 
C\-740/22, “Endemol Shine”)
The broad deﬁnition of “personal data” 
(Case C‑479/22 P, “OC”)

GDPR ﬁnes: Penalties under the GDPR continue 
to bite, with signiﬁcant regulatory decisions 
issued:

○

○

Meta: $1\.3 billion (data transfers)
TikTok: $415 million (privacy by design)
Criteo: $42 million (failure to obtain 
consent)

UK reforms advance: UK lawmakers are debating 
plans to reform data protection and privacy law, 
which could complicate compliance for UK 
businesses.
AI Act ﬁnalized: The EU’s institutions agreed 
landmark rules regulating artiﬁcial intelligence, 
adding to a barrage of complex digital 
regulations passed in recent years.

Privacy Requests Increased 
246% in Two Years

Businesses received nearly one\-third more Data 
Subject Requests (DSRs) in 2023 compared to 2022\. 
Requests of all types—access, delete, or sale 
opt\-outs— increased.

DSRs per Million Users 2021\-2023

27

Why are the number of DSRs continuing to climb?

Across the US, ﬁve new state laws took effect last year that give consumers 
new rights over their personal data. Many similar laws passed in other states 
that will take effect over the next few years. This trend suggests a growing 
privacy awareness among consumers, partly due to these new laws passing, 
frequent privacy enforcement action from the FTC, and increased media 
attention on privacy.

On average, 
businesses 
received 859 DSRs 
per one million 
identities in 2023

Deletion Is the Most 
Common Type of Request

Privacy Requests to delete personal data exceed access 
and ‘do not sell’ requests for the third year running

Consumers continue to ask businesses to delete their personal data, making it the most 
common type of DSR, accounting for more than 40% of requests on average across 
businesses. While deletion requests remain most common, access requests have increased 
most signiﬁcantly, booming by around 50% since the previous year.

2023 Breakdown By DSR Type

We focus on three main types of DSR: Requests to access personal data, delete personal 
data, and requests opt out of the sale and sharing of personal data (“Do Not Sell” 
requests)—as these are the most popular requests. Every comprehensive privacy law in the 
US includes the right to delete personal data under certain conditions. We also saw 
requests to correct inaccurate personal data and requests under the “right to data 
portability,” but not enough to establish any trends.

The Cost of Data Privacy 
Continues to Rise

Manual processing of DSRs can cost $1M per year, or more.

Businesses manually processing DSRs face high costs as the number of 
requests increases. According to Gartner, a single access or deletion request 
costs around $1,524 to complete. Our data suggests that a company handling 
one million identities receives 578 access and deletion requests in an 
average year. Based on Gartner’s estimate, manually processing DSRs could 
cost around $811,305 per every million identities.

2023 Cost of DSR Management Over Time

$41,148\.00

As businesses collect more data and privacy requests increase, handling 
DSRs becomes difﬁcult and expensive. Companies can struggle to locate 
data stored in different formats across different systems, all while ensuring 
they do not violate the rights of other consumers. Businesses face a huge rise 
in costs unless they automate parts of the DSR process. These costs 
estimates do not include requests relating to other rights, such as requests 
to opt out of the sale and sharing of personal data.

DSR Management 
can cost $811K Year

management 
increased by 38%

Opting\-Out Is Becoming 
Mainstream

Consumers are automating “Do Not Sell” requests; 
around 75% of businesses are not honoring them.

Universal Opt Out Mechanisms (UOOMs) enable consumers to automatically tell businesses 
not to sell or share their personal data for advertising. Until recently, honoring UOOM signals 
has been optional in the US. This is changing. California already requires CCPA\-covered 
businesses to detect and honor requests made via Global Privacy Control (GPC) and other 
common UOOMs. A similar rule takes effect in Colorado from July 2024, and many other 
states will follow over the next few years. DataGrail analyzed over 5,000 websites to check 
how businesses respond to GPC signals. We found that 75% of websites did not honor
“Do Not Sell” requests via GPC.

75%

Our research suggests that 75% of 
websites do not comply with GPC 
requests. This means most businesses
are not honorings people’s do\-not\-sell 
privacy requests. Some could be violating 
current law or be unprepared for 
upcoming legal changes.

”GPC is a way users can universally express, to 
all sites, their preference not to be tracked on 
the web. It is a browser\-level signal, 
maintained either by a browser or browser 
extension, that a user or privacy\-focused 
technology can set. The easiest way to think of 
GPC is as a robot that selects the Do Not Sell 
preference on a site on behalf of a user.”

2023 Volume of Do\-Not\-Sell 
Requests per 1M Identities

UOOMs automate requests under California’s 
“Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information” 
rules and similar laws. Such requests are rising 
and will likely increase signiﬁcantly as new laws 
take effect.

Privacy Requests Across 
Industries

Industries with a lot of online communications see the 
most requests

Our data shows how many DSRs consumers make to businesses across 
different industries. Ecommerce—or brands that have a direct to consumer 
(D2C) online relationship —typically receive the most DSRs. They receive 
nearly double the overall average number of DSRs. Marketing tech (MarTech) 
companies come second. Both these types of companies operate mainly 
online and can engage in intensive marketing campaigns, meaning they 
collect a lot of personal data.

Retail: We distinguished retail brands from ecommerce brands as those who typically sell in a “brick \& mortar” 
setting, vs. online. 
Ecommerce: This includes brands whose primary go\-to\-market model is selling directly online to consumers. This 
also includes the growing “Wellness” market, MLM companies, consumer marketplaces, and or consumer health 
companies that may hold a lot of sensitive data. 
B2B Technology: This includes several enterprise technology companies. Companies that provide software ranging 
from database software and APIs to HR system software.
Marketing Tech: Because marketing \& sales technology includes email, CRM, surveys, and communications 
technology, we pulled Marketing Technology out into its own category. Typically this bucket represents businesses 
who market in a B2B setting.

Privacy Requests Can 
Come From Practically 
Anywhere

Consumers worldwide want control over their data 
even if they’re not protected by privacy law; and 
businesses are honoring their requests.

46% of DSRs arrived from IP addresses located outside the US, Canada, China, 
Brazile the UK, or the EU (regions with privacy laws). As such, people making 
these requests might not be covered by strong privacy laws. Around 12\.5% of 
US\-based DSRs came from states with laws already on the books (CA, CO, \& CT), 
yet 34% are coming from states without privacy protections, suggesting people 
from across the US are submitting requests regardless of their level of legal 
protection. Consumers want more control over their data even if they don’t have 
legally\-protected privacy rights. 

DSRs By Policy in 2023

80%

of DSRs in 2023 came from 
jurisdictions that didn’t have 
strong privacy laws, 
evidence that people around 
the world want more control 
over their personal data. 

Note: As a United States\-based company with a larger regional footprint in the US, our data skews toward privacy 
requests coming from the US and may not be an accurate reﬂection of total global requests. Many DataGrail 
customers apply GDPR\-grade DSR processes across the board, which helps to ensure good customer relations
and improves the efﬁciency of their privacy programs.

Data Privacy has arrived:
It’s time to adapt

Privacy laws are proliferating, awareness of rights is increasing, and 
the costs could spiral if organizations fail to act

When the EU passed the GDPR in 2016, many 
countries strengthened their data protection 
and privacy laws. It took a few years for this 
legal trend to hit the US, but now around 
one\-third of states have passed 
comprehensive privacy laws.

Against this backdrop, consumers are waking 
up to how their data is collected, used, and 
shared online. Privacy requests are booming 
year on year, with businesses facing on 
average 859 DSRs per one million identities in 
2023 compared to 377 in 2021\.

Before our next report in 2025, privacy laws 
will start to take effect in states like Delaware, 
Florida, Iowa, Montana, Oregon, and Texas. We’ll 
continue to see enforcement of existing laws 
in the US, the EU, and elsewhere.

We also expect more consumers to use 
Universal Opt\-Out Mechanisms (UOOMs) to 
automate “Do Not Sell” requests. In more and 
more states, honoring these requests will 
become mandatory—but our research 
suggests that most companies are not ready 
for this new landscape.

But as our data shows, DSRs can come from 
anywhere. Whether or not they’re covered by a 
privacy law, consumers want more control 
over how businesses use their personal data. 
This “trend” isn’t going away. For unprepared 
businesses, the costs could be eye\-watering.

As legal demands and consumer expectations 
increase, take control of your privacy program 
with an automated platform that efﬁciently 
handles all types of privacy requests.
