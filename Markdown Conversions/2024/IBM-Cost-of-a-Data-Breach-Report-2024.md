## Executive summary
IBM’s annual Cost of a Data Breach Report provides IT, risk 
management and security leaders with timely, quantifiable 
evidence to guide them in their strategic decision-making. It 
also helps them better manage their risk profiles and security 
investments. This year’s report—the 19th of the series—reflects 
changes caused by technological shifts, such as the rise of 
shadow data, which is data residing in unmanaged data sources, 
and the extent and costs of business disruption brought about by 
data breaches.

The report’s research—conducted independently by Ponemon 
Institute and sponsored, analyzed and published by IBM—
studied 604 organizations impacted by data breaches between 
March 2023 and February 2024. Researchers looked at 
organizations across 17 industries, in 16 countries and regions, 
and breaches that ranged from 2,100 to 113,000 compromised 
records. To gain on-the-ground insights, Ponemon Institute 
researchers interviewed 3,556 security and C-suite business 
leaders with firsthand knowledge of the data breach incidents  
at their organizations. 

The result is a benchmark report that business and security 
leaders can use to strengthen their security defenses and drive 
innovation, particularly around the adoption of AI in security and 
security for their generative AI (gen AI) initiatives. 

We lead this year’s report with 2 major developments. First, the 
global average cost of a data breach increased 10% over the 
previous year, reaching USD 4.88 million, the biggest jump since 
the pandemic. Business disruption and post-breach customer 
support and remediation drove this cost spike. When asked how 
they’re dealing with these costs, more than half of organizations 
said they are passing them on to customers. Having customers 
absorb these costs can be problematic in a competitive market 
already facing pricing pressures from inflation.

Second, on the defender side of the equation, researchers also 
found applying security AI and automation is paying off, lowering 
breach costs in some instances by an average of USD 2.2 million. 
AI and automation solutions are reducing the lifespan needed 
to identify and contain a breach and its resulting damage. Put 
another way, defenders without AI and automation to assist 
them can expect to take longer to detect and contain a breach, 
and see costs rise compared to those who use these solutions.

As we’ve seen across the industry, cybersecurity teams are 
consistently understaffed. This year’s study found more than 
half of breached organizations faced severe security staffing 
shortages, a skills gap that increased by double digits from the 
previous year. This lack of trained security staff is growing as the 
threat landscape widens. The continuing race to adopt gen AI 
across nearly every function in the organization is expected to 
bring with it unprecedented risks and put even more pressure on 
these cybersecurity teams. 

This report provides insights and recommendations from the 
research to help reduce the potential financial and reputational 
damages from a data breach.

## What’s new in the 2024 report
Each year, we continue to evolve the Cost of a Data Breach 
Report to reflect new technologies, emerging tactics and recent 
events. For the first time, this year’s research explores:
	
- Whether organizations experienced long-term operational 
disruption, for example, the inability to process sales orders, 
a complete shutdown of production facilities, ineffective 
customer services
	
- Whether the breach included data stored in unmanaged data 
sources, otherwise known as shadow data
	
- To what extent organizations are using AI and automation in 
each of 4 areas of security operations: prevention, detection, 
investigation and response
	
- The nature of extortion attacks, for example, extortion and 
ransomware attacks or extortion and data exfiltration only
	
- The time it takes to restore data, systems or services to their 
pre-breach state
	
- How long it took organizations to report the breach if they 
were mandated to do so
	
- Whether organizations that involved law enforcement 
following a ransomware attack paid the ransom

## Key findings
The key findings described here are based on IBM analysis of 
research data compiled by Ponemon Institute. 

### Average total cost of a breach
The average cost of a data breach jumped to USD 4.88 million 
from USD 4.45 million in 2023, a 10% spike and the highest 
increase since the pandemic. A rise in the cost of lost business, 
including operational downtime and lost customers, and the cost 
of post-breach responses, such as staffing customer service help 
desks and paying higher regulatory fines, drove this increase. 
Taken together, these costs totaled USD 2.8 million, the highest 
combined amount for lost business and post-breach activities 
over the past 6 years.

### Cost savings from extensive use of AI in prevention
2 out of 3 organizations studied stated they’re deploying security 
AI and automation across their security operations center, a 
10% jump from the prior year. When deployed extensively across 
prevention workflows—attack surface management (ASM), red-
teaming and posture management—organizations averaged USD 
2.2 million less in breach costs compared to those with no AI use 
in prevention workflows. This finding was the largest cost savings 
revealed in the 2024 report.

### Growth of the cyber skills shortage
More than half of breached organizations are facing high  
levels of security staffing shortages. This issue represents 
a 26.2% increase from the prior year, a situation that 
corresponded to an average USD 1.76 million more in breach 
costs. Even as 1 in 5 organizations say they used some form  
of gen AI security tools—which are expected to help close the 
gap by boosting productivity and efficiency—this skills gap 
remains a challenge.

### Days to identify and contain breaches involving stolen credentials
Breaches involving stolen or compromised credentials took the 
longest to identify and contain (292 days) of any attack vector. 
Similar attacks that involved taking advantage of employees and 
employee access also took a long time to resolve. For example, 
phishing attacks lasted an average of 261 days, while social 
engineering attacks took an average of 257 days.

### Share of breaches involving customer personal data
Nearly half of all breaches involved customer personal 
identifiable information (PII), which can include tax identification 
(ID) numbers, emails, phone numbers and home addresses. 
Intellectual property (IP) records came in a close second (43% 
of breaches). The cost of IP records jumped considerably from 
last year, to USD 173 per record in this year’s study from USD 
156 per record in last year’s report.

### Share of breaches involving shadow data
35% of breaches involved shadow data, showing the 
proliferation of data is making it harder to track and safeguard. 
Shadow data theft correlated to a 16% greater cost of a breach. 
Researchers found storing data across environments proved to 
be a common storage strategy, accounting for 40% of breaches. 
These breaches also took longer to identify and contain. In 
contrast, data stored in just 1 type of environment was breached 
less often, whether that environment was public cloud (25%), on 
premises (20%) or private cloud (15%).

### Largest average cost increase among all industries
The industrial sector experienced the costliest increase of any 
industry, rising by an average USD 830,000 per breach over 
last year. This cost spike could reflect the need for industrial 
organizations to prepare for a more rapid response, as 
organizations in this sector are highly sensitive to operational 
downtime. Still, the time to identify and contain a data breach  
at industrial organizations was above the median industry, at  
199 days to identify and 73 days to contain.

### Average cost of a malicious insider attack
Compared to other vectors, malicious insider attacks resulted 
in the highest costs, averaging USD 4.99 million. Among other 
expensive attack vectors were business email compromise, 
phishing, social engineering and stolen or compromised 
credentials. Gen AI may be playing a role in creating some of 
these phishing attacks. For example, gen AI makes it easier than 
ever for even non-English speakers to produce grammatically 
correct and plausible phishing messages.

### Cost savings when law enforcement is involved in ransomware attacks
Ransomware victims that involved law enforcement ended up 
lowering the cost of the breach by an average of nearly USD 1 
million, and that excludes the cost of any ransom paid. Involving 
law enforcement also helped shorten the time required to 
identify and contain breaches from 297 days to 281 days.

## Global highlights  
Globally, security teams are doing a much better job of detecting 
and containing breaches, despite a stubborn skills shortage. 
More than half of breached organizations are facing security 
staffing shortages, and security leaders are, in turn, marshalling 
AI and automation solutions to close the skills gap. Despite their 
efforts, breach costs are rising, mostly from expenses related to 
business disruption and post-breach responses. In the following 
section, we look at these issues and others, across industries, 
countries and regions, to provide security leaders with a view of 
the risks out there so you can learn from them.

### The global average cost of a data breach spiked 
The global average cost of a data breach increased 10% in 
one year, reaching USD 4.88 million, the biggest jump since 
the pandemic. Business disruption and post-breach response 
activities drove most of this yearly cost increase. See Figure 1.

![Image of Figure 1. Measured in USD millions Global average total cost of a data breach USD 4.88M The global average cost of a data breach spikes]

### The United States led the world in average breach cost
For the 14th year, the United States had the highest average 
data breach cost—USD 9.36 million—among the 16 countries 
and regions studied. Rounding out the top 5 were the Middle 
East, Germany, Italy and Benelux. Benelux is the economic union 
of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and it’s a new 
addition this year. Notably, Canada and Japan saw average costs 
drop, while Italy and the Middle East saw significant increases. 
See Figures 2A and 2B.

### Healthcare topped industry costs, again
The average breach cost for healthcare fell 10.6%, to USD 9.77 
million. But that factor wasn’t enough to remove it from the 
top costliest industry for breaches—a spot it’s held since 2011. 
Healthcare remains a target for attackers since the industry often 
suffers from existing technologies and is highly vulnerable to 
disruption, which can put patient safety at stake. See Figure 3.

![Image of Figure 3. Measured in USD millions Cost of a data breach by industry]

### Average time to identify and contain a breach fell
The mean time it took defenders to identity and contain a  
breach dropped to 258 days, reaching a 7-year low, compared 
to 277 days the previous year. Note: this global average of 
mean time to identify (MTTI) and mean time to contain (MTTC) 
excludes Benelux because, as a new region in the study, it was 
having outsized influence and skewed results much more than 
the average. See Figure 4.

![Image of Figure 4. Measured in days Time to identify and contain a data breach]

### Lost business costs and post-breach response costs soared
Costs from lost business and post-breach response rose nearly 
11% over the previous year, which contributed to the significant 
rise in overall breach costs. Lost business costs include revenue 
loss due to system downtime, and the cost of lost customers and 
reputation damage. Post-breach costs can include the expense 
of setting up call centers and credit monitoring services for 
impacted customers, and paying regulatory fines. See Figure 5.

![Image of Figure 5. Measured in USD millions Average cost of a data breach in 4 components]

### Most breaches involved customer PII
The most common type of data stolen or compromised was 
customer PII, at 46%. PII can include tax ID numbers, emails 
and home addresses, and can be used in identity theft and credit 
card fraud. The global average for all stolen record types rose to 
a high of USD 169, with employee PII the costliest. See Figures 
6A and 6B.

## Initial attack vectors and root causes
For the 2nd year in a row, phishing and stolen or compromised 
credentials were the 2 most prevalent attack vectors. Both also 
ranked among the top 4 costliest incident types. In addition to 
identifying the most common root causes for breaches, the study 
compared the average cost for each category, as well as the 
average time to identify and contain those breaches.

### Compromised credentials topped initial attack vectors 
Using compromised credentials benefited attackers in 16% of 
breaches. Compromised credential attacks can also be costly 
for organizations, accounting for an average USD 4.81 million 
per breach. Phishing came in a close second, at 15% of attack 
vectors, but in the end cost more, at USD 4.88 million. Malicious 
insider attacks cost the most, at USD 4.99 million, but were only 
7% of all breach pathways. See Figure 7.

![Image of Figure 7. Measured in USD millions; percentage of all breaches Cost and frequency of a data breach by initial attack vector USD 4.81M The average cost of a breach when attackers used compromised credentials, which happened in 16% of the breach cases studied.]

### Credential-based attacks took longer to identify and contain
Whether credentials were stolen or used by malicious insiders, 
attack identification and containment time increased, yielding 
an average combined time of 292 and 287 days respectively. 
Defenders needed to distinguish between legitimate and 
malicious user activity on the network, making threats harder to 
identify. On the other hand, attacks using zero-day vulnerabilities 
were the most time-consuming to contain. See Figure 8.

![Image of Figure 8. Measured in days Top 5 categories in response time]

### IT failures or human error caused nearly half of all breaches
Malicious attacks—those committed by outside attackers or 
criminal insiders—made up 55% of all breaches. As concerning 
as these breaches are, it’s important to remember the remaining 
23% are due to IT failure and 22% are due to human error.  See 
Figure 9.

![Image of Figure 9. Root cause of the data breach between 3 categories]

## Data breach lifecycle
In a data breach, time means money, and breaches with longer 
lifecycles were more costly, according to our 2024 and 2023 
research. A complete breach lifecycle is the combination of the 
average number of days to identify and contain a breach. In both 
reports, we compared the average costs of data breaches where 
the complete breach lifecycle was under 200 days to the average 
cost of breaches where complete lifecycles exceeded 200 days. 

### Longer breach lifecycles led to higher costs 
In this year’s report, researchers found data breaches with a 
lifecycle exceeding 200 days had the highest average cost, at 
USD 5.46 million, compared to breaches with lifecycles under 
200 days. These findings are consistent with those from the 
previous year. Notably, while costs for longer data breach 
lifecycles increased 10.3% this year over last year, costs for 
shorter lifecycles also increased, but by a smaller amount, 3.6%. 
See Figure 10.

![Image of Figure 10. Measured in USD millions Cost of a data breach based on the breach lifecycle]

## Identifying the breach
To contain a data breach, it needs to be identified first. Who 
identifies it, and how quickly, make a difference in the resulting 
data breach costs. This year, we found security teams working 
with their own tools improved their performance in this area. In 
other cases, breaches were identified by benign third parties, 
such as security researchers, law enforcement and consultants, 
or the attackers themselves.

### Security teams identified most breaches
Security teams and their tools detected breaches far more often, 
at 42% of the time, than did benign third parties, at 34%, and 
attackers themselves, at 24%. This figure was an improvement 
over the 2023 report when security teams discovered breaches 
only one-third of the time. The change shows security teams 
were able to speed up detection. See Figure 11.

![Image of Figure 11. Only 1 response permitted How was the breach identified? Organizations’ security teams and tools Disclosure from the attacker Benign third party 42% 33% 34% 40% 24% 27% 01 03 02 2024 2023 2024 2023]

### Breaches disclosed by attackers cost more
By the time an attacker discloses a breach, they’ll likely have 
already achieved their objective and done considerable damage, 
raising the overall costs of the breach. When a breach was 
disclosed by an attacker, the average cost was USD 5.53 million. 
On the other hand, when a security team identified a breach, the 
average cost was USD 4.55 million. See Figure 12.

![Image of Figure 12. Measured in USD millions USD 5.53M The average cost of a breach when the breach was disclosed by an attacker. Cost of a data breach by how the breach was identified]

### Faster breach identification and containment
The report found regardless of how a breach was discovered, 
organizations identified and contained them more quickly on 
average in 2024 than the previous year. The use of AI and 
automation likely contributed to this acceleration, as the next 
section of this report shows. See Figure 13.

![Image of Figure 13. Measured in days Time to identify and contain a breach by how the breach was identified]

## Security AI and automation
AI and automation are transforming the world of cybersecurity. 
They make it easier than ever for bad actors to create and launch 
attacks at scale and provide defenders with new tools for rapidly 
identifying threats and automating responses to those threats. 
This year’s report found these technologies accelerated the work 
of identifying and containing breaches and reducing costs.

### AI and automation use grew
The number of organizations that used security AI and 
automation extensively grew to 31% in this year’s study from 
28% last year. Although it’s just a 3 percentage point difference, 
it represents a 10.7% increase in use. The share of those using 
AI and automation on a limited basis also grew from 33% to 
36%, a 9.1% increase. See Figure 14.

![Image of Figure 14. Percentage of organizations per usage level State of security AI and automation comparing 3 usage levels]

### More AI and automation meant lower breach costs
The more organizations used AI and automation, the lower their 
average breach costs. That correlation is striking and one of the 
key findings of this year’s report. Organizations not using AI and 
automation had average costs of USD 5.72 million, while those 
making extensive use of AI and automation had average costs  
of USD 3.84 million, a savings of USD 1.88 million. See Figure 15.

![Image of Figure 15. Measured in USD millions Cost of a data breach by AI and automation usage level]

### More AI equaled faster identification and containment
Organizations extensively using security AI and automation 
identified and contained data breaches nearly 100 days faster  
on average than organizations that didn’t use these technologies 
at all. See Figure 16.

![Image of Figure 16. Measured in days Time to identify and contain a data breach by AI and automation usage level]

### Security teams applied AI and automation evenly across functions
Among organizations that stated they used AI and automation 
extensively, about 27% used AI extensively in each of these 
categories: prevention, detection, investigation and response. 
Roughly 40% used AI technologies at least somewhat. See 
Figure 17.

![Image of Figure 17. From the respondents that reported extensive use of AI and automation; reference chart 14 How much AI and automation did you use in 4 security categories? 27% Share of organizations that used AI and automation across 4 security categories.]

### Extensive use of AI and automation lowered costs
When AI and automation were used extensively in each of the  
4 areas of security, it dramatically lowered average breach costs 
compared to organizations that didn’t use these technologies 
in those areas. For example, when organizations used AI and 
automation extensively for prevention, their average breach  
cost was USD 3.76 million. Meanwhile, organizations that didn’t 
use these tools in prevention saw USD 5.98 million in costs, a 
45.6% difference. See Figure 18.

![Image of Figure 18. From the organizations that reported extensive use of AI and automation, measured in USD millions; reference chart 14 Cost of a data breach based on where AI and automation are deployed in security operations]

### AI and automation accelerated the time to identify and contain a breach
Wherever AI and automation were applied, they accelerated the 
work of identifying and containing breaches. Extensive use of AI 
and automation in any security function—prevention, detection, 
investigation or response—reduced the average MTTI and MTTC 
for data breaches by 33% for response and 43% for prevention. 
See Figure 19.

![Image of Figure 19. From the organizations that reported extensive use of AI and automation, measured in days; reference chart 14 Time to identify and contain a data breach based on where AI and automation are deployed in security operations]

## Raising prices post-breach
By their nature, data breaches are expensive. When 
organizations find themselves saddled with multimillion-dollar 
costs, they may look to recoup those costs elsewhere. One 
option is to pass them along to their own customers in the form 
of price hikes, which is an increasing trend. Raising prices can be 
risky in a market already facing pricing pressure.

### Organizations passed breach costs to customers
Most organizations said they planned to increase prices of goods 
and services following a data breach, passing costs along to 
customers. The share of organizations that planned to do so 
increased to 63% this year from 57% last year, representing a 
10.5% increase. See Figure 20.

![Image of Figure 20. Share of all organizations Did the data breach result in your organization increasing the cost of its products and services?]

## Business disruption
Business runs on data. When data is breached, business is 
disrupted. These disruptions can vary from small breaches that 
affect only a few systems to long-lasting, organization-wide, 
operational shutdowns. Our research explored how minor or 
significant those disruptions were, and how the severity of a 
disruption correlated with data breach costs.

### Business disruption was substantial
70% of organizations in this year’s study experienced a 
significant or very significant disruption to business resulting 
from a breach. Only 1% described their level of disruption as low. 
See Figure 21.

![Image of Figure 21. Only 1 response permitted What level of business disruption did you experience because of the data breach? 70% Share of organizations that experienced a significant or very significant disruption to business as a result of a breach.]

### Average cost of a breach increased with disruption
Average breach costs were higher when business disruption was 
greater. Even organizations that reported low levels of disruption 
incurred average data breach costs of USD 4.63 million. For 
organizations that reported very significant disruptions, average 
costs were 7.9% higher, at USD 5.01 million. See Figure 22.

![Image of Figure 22. Measured in USD millions Cost of a data breach based on the level of business disruption]

## Recovery time
Even after a breach is contained, the work of recovery goes on. 
In this study, recovery means:
	
- Business operations are back to normal in areas affected by 
the breach.
	
- Organizations have met compliance obligations, such as 
paying fines.
	
- Customer confidence and employee trust have been restored.
	
- Organizations have put controls, technologies and expertise in 
place to avoid future data breaches.

Much of this work, such as re-establishing customer confidence, 
involves factors beyond technology. For most organizations, the 
hard work of recovery can be months away.

### Breach recovery rates were low
Only 12% of organizations queried during this year’s report 
said they had fully recovered from their data breaches. Most 
organizations said they were still working on them. See  
Figure 23.

![Image of Figure 23. Share of all breached organizations Has your organization recovered from the data breach?]

### Full recovery took longer than 100 days 
Among the share of organizations that had fully recovered, 
more than three-quarters said they took longer than 100 
days. Recovery is a protracted process. Roughly one-third of 
organizations that had fully recovered said they required more 
than 150 days to do so. A small share, 3%, of fully recovered 
organizations were able to do so in less than 50 days. See  
Figure 24.

![Image of Figure 24. From the organizations that reported they had recovered fully from the incident, measured in days (reference chart 23) Average time to recover from a data breach 35% 24% 19% 14% 5% 3% > 150 days 126 to 150 days 101 to 125 days 76 to 100 days 51 to 75 days < 50 days]

## Factors that decreased or increased the average breach cost
When analyzing costs, it’s helpful to know which technologies 
or events tend to lower or raise them. One constant we found: 
AI and automation lowers costs, while a high level of cyber 
skills shortage raises them. In this analysis, we looked at 28 
contributing factors. We examined the impact of each in isolation 
against the global average. We then looked at the top 3 factors 
found to amplify or mitigate the average data breach cost.

### Key factors that reduced costs
Employee training and the use of AI and machine learning 
insights were the top factors mitigating average data breach 
costs in this analysis. Employee training continues to be an 
essential element in cyberdefense strategies, specifically 
for detecting and stopping phishing attacks. AI and machine 
learning insights closely followed in second place. See Figure 25.

![Image of Figure 25. Cost difference from USD 4.88M breach average; measured in USD Factors that reduced the average breach cost]

### Key factors that increased costs
The top 3 factors that amplified breach costs in this analysis 
were security system complexity, security skills shortage and 
third-party breaches, which can include supply chain breaches. 
See Figure 26. 

![Image of Figure 26. Cost difference from USD 4.88M breach average; measured in USD Factors that increased the average breach cost]

### High versus low levels of key cost amplifying factors 
When organizations suffered from a high-level shortage of 
security skills, average breach costs were USD 5.74 million, 
compared to organizations with a low-level skills shortage, with 
USD 3.98 million. Similar disparities were seen across 2 other 
key cost factor areas. See Figure 27.

### High versus low levels of key cost mitigating factors
When organizations suffered from low levels of employee 
training, average breach costs were USD 5.10 million, compared 
to organizations with high levels of employee training, with USD 
4.15 million. Similar disparities were seen across 2 other key 
cost factor areas. See Figure 28.

### Security skills shortage
The number of organizations facing a critical lack of skilled 
security workers rose dramatically, to 53% in 2024 compared to 
42% last year. This year’s research found a strong link between 
the worsening skills shortage and higher data breach costs.

### Skills shortage equated to higher breach costs
In 2024, the average cost of breaches associated with a high-
level skills shortage jumped to USD 5.74 million from USD 5.36 
million last year, a 7.1% rise. This increase was USD 860,000 
higher than the global average breach cost. See Figure 29.

## The cost of extortion attacks
The amount an organization spends on extortion attacks 
can vary based on type—ransomware, data exfiltration and 
destructive—as well as the way the organization responds. This 
factor is particularly true if law enforcement is called in, as this 
year’s study shows, where costs dropped dramatically when law 
enforcement investigators were involved. All 3 types of attacks 
were examined, including ransomware, where data is encrypted 
and a ransom demanded; data exfiltration, where data is stolen 
and the organization sometimes extorted; and destructive,
