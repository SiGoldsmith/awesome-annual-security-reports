EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Since 2020, Rapid7 has released an annual Vulnerability Intelligence Report 
with curated vulnerability data and in\-depth analyses of exploit trends. In an 
effort to broaden the scope of this research and offer a more holistic view of 
the attack landscape, this year's report — renamed The Attack Intelligence 
Report — combines vulnerability and exploit research with hands\-on data from 
Rapid7's managed detection and response (MDR) division, as well as our threat 
analytics and emergent threat response teams. 

Our 2024 Attack Intelligence Report presents insights and guidance that 
security practitioners can use to better understand and anticipate modern cyber 
threats. This year’s report highlights multi\-year vulnerability and exploit trends 
in addition to examining recent high\-impact attacks and CVEs. This research 
is based on 210\+ vulnerabilities disclosed since the end of 2019, including 
60\+ exploited vulnerabilities from 2023 and early 2024\. See our appendix for 
additional context on vulnerability selection.

Key findings include:

In 2023, for the second time in three years, more mass compromise 
events arose from zero\-day vulnerabilities than from n\-day vulnerabilities. 
53% of new widespread threat vulnerabilities through the beginning of 
2024 were exploited before software producers could implement fixes 
— a return to 2021 levels of widespread zero\-day exploitation (52%) 
after a slight respite (43%) in 2022\. 

Mass compromise events stemming from exploitation of network edge 
devices have almost doubled since the start of 2023, with 36% of widely 
exploited vulnerabilities occurring in network perimeter technologies. 
More than 60% of the vulnerabilities Rapid7 analyzed in network and 
security appliances in 2023 were exploited as zero\-days. 

While skilled adversaries are still fond of memory corruption exploits, 
most of the widely exploited CVEs from the past few years have arisen 
from simpler, more easily exploitable root causes, like command injection 
and improper authentication issues. 

41% of incidents Rapid7 MDR observed in 2023 were the result 
of missing or unenforced multi\-factor authentication (MFA) on internet\-
facing systems, particularly VPNs and virtual desktop infrastructure.

Rapid7 Labs tracked more than 5,600 separate ransomware incidents 
over the course of 2023 and the first few months of 2024\. The number of 
unique ransomware families reported across 2023 incidents decreased 
by more than half, from 95 new families in 2022 to 43 in 2023\.

Big Picture: Threat 
Climate Change

Over the last several years, Rapid7 researchers have regularly published in\-depth 
analyses of significant vulnerabilities and major cyber incidents, prioritizing attack 
vectors that have threatened many organizations globally. In 2020, amid what 
was then considered to be an “outbreak” of critical vulnerability exploitation, 
our research team began tracking widely exploited CVEs separately from 
CVEs used in limited, targeted attacks, which were often conducted by a single 
threat actor. Rapid7’s inaugural vulnerability intelligence report included just 
over a dozen of these “widespread threats,” meaning vulnerabilities with many 
attackers and a large vulnerable target population. At the time, this elevated 
risk climate was novel, compelling, even alarming. 

But 2021 onward put prior years to shame, drawing a rather stark divide 
between “then” and “now.” Zero\-day exploitation soared, reaching a new zenith 
before leveling off at what looks to be permanently high altitude; the median 
number of days between vulnerability disclosure and exploitation, which we 
began tracking several years ago, has stayed in single digits across the CVEs 
in our annual datasets; widespread exploitation of major vulnerabilities has 
shifted from a notable event to a baseline expectation; ransomware attacks 
regularly take entire public\-facing systems offline, sometimes for weeks or 
months at a time; and state\-sponsored adversaries have ramped up activity 
across sectors, using geopolitical conflict as both a rationale and a disguise 
for espionage, hacktivism, supply chain sabotage, and more.

A hearty and heartfelt disdain for hype is baked into Rapid7 research philosophy. 
When we talk about a changing threat climate, we require hard evidence — 
evidence collected and analyzed beyond the binary categorization of “exploited” 
and “not.” If we’re to say the world has changed, our research ideology demands 
we produce data to support that claim.

The world has changed. As in previous years, zero\-day attacks and widespread 
exploitation remained common across the vulnerabilities we analyzed in 2023 
and the start of 2024\. But we’ve also seen a pronounced shift in the way some 
widespread compromise events play out. 

55

Instead of following the familiar pattern of “many attackers, many targets,” 
nearly a quarter (23%) of widespread threat CVEs arose from well\-planned, 
highly orchestrated zero\-day attacks in which a single adversary compromised 
dozens or hundreds of organizations in one fell swoop, often leveraging custom 
tooling like proprietary exploits and backdoors. These aren’t our grandparents’ 
cyberthreats — this is a mature, well\-organized cybercrime ecosystem at 
work, with increasingly sophisticated mechanisms to gain access, establish 
persistence, and evade detection. 

Anecdotally, these compounding changes in the threat climate have also incited 
some regressive practices among software producers. In our experience, 
it’s been increasingly common for vendors to silently patch security issues, 
withholding advisories and CVE descriptions until days or weeks later. Even 
then, more vendors appear to be deliberately obfuscating vulnerability details, 
declining to publish root cause and attack vector information based on an 
understandable but misguided belief that obscurity deters adversaries and 
mitigates reputational risk to software producers. 

Finally, we’ve also seen the broader security market start to veer even more 
heavily toward privatization of vulnerability and exploit information, with 
technical findings often shared in closed loops rather than openly — for profit 
or otherwise. The rumors of Twitter’s demise exacerbated this trend starting 
in late 2022, with many disillusioned security community members opting to 
migrate to an array of alternative platforms and closed intelligence\-sharing 
circles. As of March 2024, industry concern over the future of the National 
Vulnerability Database (NVD) has sparked new discussions on whether a 
move toward private ownership of the database might be an improvement 
over public stewardship. 

These are nuanced challenges without simple solutions, and often without 
institutional or industry support for the human critical infrastructure that so 
much of our technological ecosystem depends upon — from exhausted security 
practitioners to beleaguered open\-source maintainers and under\-appreciated 
public\-sector analysts. Privatization can be a powerful tool, but it’s not a panacea. 
When we consider it, we should also consider what we may be giving up.

Vulnerability 
Exploitation Trends

A Note on Exploitation Terminology

Starting in 2023, all of the vulnerabilities we categorize as exploited in the wild 
in our data are confirmed to have been exploited successfully by adversaries in 
real\-world production environments. This is a departure from previous years, 
where occasionally we would use third\-party honeypot data as a primary source 
of in\-the\-wild exploitation of the CVEs in our vulnerability intelligence datasets. 

Certain attack\-related terms have become more broadly adopted by the industry 
over the past 18 to 24 months. We’ve seen a higher number of claims signaling 
“mass exploitation” or “widespread exploitation” of new vulnerabilities, including 
in a number of cases where, upon further investigation, “mass exploitation” 
actually meant a public proof of concept being lazily thrown at the internet, 
without any exploitable code paths to execute it. This is a particular risk when 
assessing threat activity around library vulnerabilities or flaws in third\-party 
components. Shared components are implemented in different ways and 
places in technology stacks, which more often than not makes them remotely 
inaccessible and difficult to target with one\-size\-fits\-all exploits. 

We have frequently observed that honeypot data does not (or cannot) distinguish 
scanning or unsuccessful exploit attempts from genuine, successful compromise 
of target systems; this is an understandable technological limitation, but it can also 
mean clumsy exploit attempts that are unlikely to succeed in real environments 
may be incorrectly interpreted as “mass exploitation.” While scanning activity 
or exploit attempts (e.g., with publicly available proof\-of\-concept code) can be 
reasonable indicators of attacker interest, they are rarely indicative of attacker 
skill. As we know well, “vulnerable” and “exploitable” are not the same thing, 
particularly without sufficient ability to develop and execute successful attacks 
outside limited test cases. The sheer number of honeypots littering the internet 
also contributes to inflated prevalence and faulty attack intel.

7

While some of the vulnerabilities discussed in this report have also been 
exploited in honeypot deployments, going forward we are changing our practices 
to only include honeypot data as authoritative evidence of exploitation if we 
can confirm code execution, payload delivery, or other high\-fidelity indicators 
of successful compromise. This applies to our own honeypot data as well as 
third\-party feeds.

2023 New Widespread Threats

Rapid7 vulnerability researchers prioritize CVEs that are likely to impact many 
organizations, instead of those likely to affect only a few. We differentiate mass 
attacks from smaller\-scale exploitation; when a vulnerability is exploited to 
compromise many organizations across many verticals and geolocations, we 
deem that vulnerability a widespread threat. Organizations should expect to 
conduct incident response investigations that look for indicators of compromise 
(IOCs) and post\-exploitation activity during widespread threat events in addition 
to activating emergency patching protocols.

Rapid7 researchers tracked more than 30 new vulnerabilities that were widely 
exploited in 2023 and the start of 2024\. More than half (53%) of the following 
CVEs arose from zero\-day exploits. Rapid7 MDR has observed exploitation of 
many of the below vulnerabilities in customer environments. 

Broadly exploited vulnerabilities that drove compromises across many 
verticals and target organizations in 2023 include:

Two Citrix NetScaler ADC/Gateway vulnerabilities (CVE\-2023\-3519 and CVE\-
2023\-4966, disclosed in July and October respectively) drove incidents that 
spanned the back half of 2023 and extended into early 2024\. CVE\-2023\-42793, 
a critical authentication bypass in JetBrains TeamCity CI/CD software, was 
disclosed in September 2023 and exploited by Russian and North Korean 
state\-sponsored threat actors, prompting bulletins from global intelligence 
agencies months after a patch was released. It was the second major supply 
chain attack vector that broke news in 2023, after a desktop application from 
telecommunications company 3CX was found to have been backdoored (CVE\-
2023\-29059\) as part of a suspected North Korean threat campaign.

Adobe ColdFusion CVE\-2023\-26360 was initially disclosed in March 2023 
as having been exploited in a limited, targeted fashion, but the vulnerability 
served as an initial access vector in multiple campaigns throughout the year, 
including a successful attack on U.S. government servers. A zero\-day remote 
code execution vulnerability in SugarCRM (CVE\-2023\-22952\) was used to 
deploy webshells and cryptominers in addition to providing initial access to 
AWS cloud environments). Attackers exploited CVE\-2023\-46604, a zero\-day 
remote code execution flaw in Apache ActiveMQ, to drop at least two different 
kinds of ransomware, as well as webshells, cryptominers, and rootkits.

While widely exploited vulnerabilities have become commonplace over the last 
few years, the past 15 months have seen a significant shift in attacker behavior 
during widespread compromise events. Before 2023, the most common 
attack pattern we observed for opportunistically exploited vulnerabilities was 
“many attackers, many targets” — namely, an initial wave of low\-skilled exploit 
attempts, frequently looking to deliver cryptominers or webshells, followed by 
more adept ransomware group and/or APT exploitation. 

9

Starting in 2023, however, we’ve seen an increase in mass compromise events 
where initial exploitation was orchestrated and executed by a single motivated 
threat actor using complex zero\-day exploit chains and/or custom implants. 

A number of 2023’s large\-scale attacks followed this pattern: 

• The Cl0p ransomware group used new zero\-day exploits to target two 
popular file transfer solutions, MOVEit Transfer (CVE\-2023\-34362\) and 
GoAnywhere MFT (CVE\-2023\-0669\), in highly orchestrated smash\-and\-grab 
campaigns that resulted in data exfiltration and extortion for hundreds of 
organizations around the world, prompting breach notifications to tens of 
millions of consumers. Both attacks were exceedingly well\-planned and 
executed; the MOVEit Transfer attack, which began over a holiday weekend 
in the U.S., may have been the culmination of nearly two years of threat 
actor reconnaissance and testing. 

• In a truly wild series of updates over the course of several weeks starting 
in May 2023, Barracuda Networks disclosed an incident where a single 
adversary used a zero\-day command injection exploit (CVE\-2023\-2868\) to 
compromise a large swath of Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances with 
a custom backdoor so persistent that the vendor finally told customers to 
decommission physical devices entirely. In late December 2023, the company 
disclosed a second zero\-day vulnerability (CVE\-2023\-7102\) that had also 
been exploited by attackers.

• In October 2023, Cisco Talos shared information on a pair of Cisco IOS XE 
zero\-day vulnerabilities (CVE\-2023\-20198, CVE\-2023\-20273\) that had been 
exploited by an as\-yet\-unattributed threat actor to deploy a custom implant 
christened “BadCandy.” The implant had reportedly been deployed on tens 
of thousands of devices before the adversary modified it to evade industry 
detection — the implant is now on at least its third iteration. 

• Investigation into a “suspected APT” attack on Ivanti Connect Secure 
and Policy Secure gateways in January 2024 revealed a zero\-day exploit 
chain (CVE\-2023\-46805, CVE\-2024\-21887\) that adversaries had used to 
compromise vulnerable devices, after which they deployed webshells and 
backdoored legitimate files. Thousands of gateways remained vulnerable 
to follow\-on CVE disclosures as of mid\-February. U.S. government agencies 
published a joint advisory on February 29 emphasizing that threat actors 
were able to deceive Ivanti’s Integrity Checker Tool (ICT), resulting in a failure 
to detect compromise; the advisory notes that “The authoring organizations 
strongly urge all organizations to consider the significant risk of adversary 
access to, and persistence on, Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure 
gateways when determining whether to continue operating these devices 
in an enterprise environment.” 

10

We’ve seen plenty of low\-skill, opportunistic attacks during 2023 and early 
2024 — so\-called script kiddies haven’t magically disappeared. But overall, the 
skill and sophistication observed in incidents like those above have trended 
much higher than in years past. While all the vulnerabilities above pertained to 
either network edge devices or file transfer technologies, concern over shifting 
attacker behavioral patterns has also made its way into discussions about 
supply chain security and insider threats — and for good reason, as key 2023 
supply chain attack vectors and major incidents showed. 

Ground Zero: Pre\-Patch Exploitation

Between the end of 2020 and the end of 2021, large\-scale incidents that 
resulted in the compromise of many organizations more than doubled; those 
statistics have never returned to pre\-2021 levels. But even more concerning 
is that widespread zero\-day threat events quintupled (and then some) in 2021 
and have become a mainstay since then. 

In 2023, for the second time in three years, more 
mass compromise events arose from zero\-day 
vulnerabilities than from n\-day vulnerabilities.

Exploited as n\-dayExploited as 0\-daySince 2021, Rapid7 researchers have tracked the time between when vulnerabilities 
become known to the public and when they are (reliably) reported as exploited 
in the wild. This window, which we call “Time to Known Exploitation,” or TTKE, 
has narrowed considerably in the past three years, largely as a result of prevalent 
zero\-day attacks. Zero\-day flaws accounted for 43% of the known\-exploited 
CVEs we’ve reported on since January 2021, with 55% of those vulnerabilities 
having been exploited within a week of public disclosure and 60% within two 
weeks. For comparison, zero\-day flaws comprised under a quarter of our 2020 
Vulnerability Intelligence Report data, with 30% of vulnerabilities exploited 
within a week and 32% within two weeks.

Average time to known exploitation tends to be a less useful metric when such 
a large proportion of TTKE values are zero. Nevertheless, the average time 
to known exploitation is just over 22 days for CVEs in our data whose TTKE 
values are known. One day is the median time to known exploitation for our 
cumulative annual datasets.

The following chart examines exploited and widely exploited vulnerabilities 
that Rapid7 has included in annual research datasets over the past four years, 
along with the percentage of these vulnerabilities that were exploited as zero\-
day flaws. Since our vulnerability classification and selection methodologies 
have necessarily become stricter and more prescribed over time, the 2023 
data below is a relatively conservative analysis of today’s exploitation trends.

Our takeaway from this data is that organizations are under considerable 
pressure not only to patch new vulnerabilities quickly and continually reduce 
internet\-facing attack surface area, but also to implement compensating 
controls and detection strategies that minimize an adversary’s ability to achieve 
objectives after that adversary has already gained access to a target network. 
Technologies like endpoint detection and response (EDR) are key components 
of a defense\-in\-depth strategy, but we believe that business leaders should 
be aware that combating and preventing modern cyberthreats continues to 
require human expertise in addition to technology. More than ever, burnout and 
brain drain on security teams compound risk from well\-resourced, motivated 
adversary operations.

Countdown to Exfil: File 
Transfer Hacks

Cl0p attacks on GoAnywhere MFT CVE\-2023\-0669 and MOVEit Transfer 
CVE\-2023\-34362 have dominated news headlines for the past year, in no 
small part because of the steady stream of breach notifications that went 
out to tens of millions of global consumers in 2023\. But GoAnywhere MFT 
and MOVEit Transfer weren’t the only file transfer technologies exploited by 
financially motivated adversaries over the past year and a half. In fact, these 
incidents were enough of a pattern in 2023 that Rapid7 researchers created a 
new “smash\-and\-grab” attacker utility category for half a dozen file transfer 
CVEs (see Attacker Utilities later in this report). 

13

Attack Scale and Speed Trends (Cumulative)ExploitedWidely Exploited0\-day (% of all exploited)0\-day (% of widely exploited) 
 
 
CVE\-2022\-47986, a YAML deserialization issue in IBM’s Aspera Faspex data 
transfer solution, was exploited by both ransomware and Iranian state\-
sponsored threat actors (Rapid7 researchers analyzed the vulnerability and 
had “more trouble preventing \[the application] from crashing than actually 
exploiting it”). CVE\-2023\-40044, another deserialization issue in Progress 
Software’s WS\_FTP secure file transfer product, came under attack via multiple 
exploit chains, including for attempted ransomware deployment. Interestingly, 
deserialization is overrepresented as a root cause across smash\-and\-grab 
exploits — a deserialization issue was also at the root of GoAnywhere MFT 
CVE\-2023\-0669, and while MOVEit Transfer CVE\-2023\-34362 itself is a SQL 
injection flaw, a .NET deserialization issue was a key part of the full remote 
code execution attack chain. 

Citrix ShareFile CVE\-2023\-24489, which very narrowly made our widespread 
threat list this year, saw a brief spike in honeypot exploitation activity in August 
2023 that tapered off faster than expected, possibly because the vendor allegedly 
disabled access on the vulnerable component until the patch had been applied. 
Still, by early 2024 the vulnerability had been cited in enough ransomware 
incident reports (public example here) to demonstrate that unpatched controllers 
remain tempting targets. The final bug we categorized as a smash\-and\-grab 
opportunity appears to be unexploited at time of writing — CVE\-2023\-43177, 
an unauthenticated remote code execution issue in CrushFTP for which a nifty 
exploit chain is publicly available. 

\*\* Estimated

14

These technologies are a boon for financially motivated adversaries in ransomware 
and extortion campaigns because of the sensitive data they can store; moreover, 
many of the attacks Rapid7 has observed on file transfer products have been 
executed quickly, with attackers getting in, stealing data, and getting out 
within minutes or hours rather than days or weeks. While there can be room 
for interpretation on data breach notification regulations generally, an attack 
ending in data exfiltration from a file transfer application has a lot less wiggle 
room as far as regulatory reporting requirements go. 

Those reporting requirements were also part of the reason that security firms, 
media, and regulators were able to quantify victims from these types of attacks 
so granularly, especially when it came to collateral damage. Counting the 
number of consumer breach notifications that go out as a result of a major 
cybersecurity incident may not be the best way to quantify attack impact, but 
it’s highly effective for tracking so\-called “blast radius.” 

Silver Linings

File transfer vendors seem to have gotten understandably spooked by the 
MOVEit Transfer and GoAnywhere MFT hacks perpetrated by Cl0p (and the 
public relations nightmare that followed for many victims). But The Year of the 
File Transfer Hack™ wasn’t without its silver linings, sparse as they may have 
been. In Rapid7’s own experience disclosing vulnerabilities to file transfer 
vendors in 2023, they were exceptionally responsive, displaying a high sense 
of urgency throughout the disclosure process and in most cases shipping 
fixes for new vulnerabilities within weeks instead of months. In several cases, 
these companies patched reported vulnerabilities in less than half the time 
most firms take. 

More broadly, there’s been evidence that some file transfer technology vendors 
are using recent Cl0p attacks as an impetus for maturing vulnerability disclosure 
and product security practices — for example, by speeding up remediation SLAs, 
establishing formal disclosure mechanisms for external security researchers, 
and implementing more frequent and transparent patch release cycles. 
These are positive indicators that may help accelerate and streamline vendor 
vulnerability responses in the future, alongside strong proactive measures that 
seek to identify new vulnerabilities before adversaries do.

Network edge devices, application development and delivery technologies, and 
IT security management systems make up most of the exploited vulnerabilities 
above, but a few outliers merit a mention. Microsoft SharePoint CVE\-2023\-
29357 started out on our “impending threat” list but was exploited in the wild 
before this report was finalized. A pair of information disclosure vulnerabilities 
(MinIO CVE\-2023\-28432, ownCloud CVE\-2023\-49103\) offered attackers access 
to cloud secrets, including credentials. An HTTP tunneling vulnerability (CVE\-
2023\-41265\) in Qlik Sense, a data analytics platform, was exploited by the 
Cactus ransomware group in November 2023 for initial access to corporate 
environments. 

Vulnerabilities that are exploited in targeted zero\-day attacks often have some 
of the more scintillating backstories, and this crop is no exception. Of the 28 
CVEs in the above list, 15 were exploited as zero\-day vulnerabilities (54%). 
Some of the notable inclusions:

• CVE\-2023\-34048, a memory corruption issue in VMware vCenter Server that 
according to Mandiant was exploited by UNC3886, a Chinese espionage 
group, for more than a year before it was discovered; 

• CVE\-2023\-28252, a privilege escalation vulnerability in Microsoft’s CLFS 
drivers that was discovered during a Nokoyawa ransomware campaign;

• CVE\-2023\-36884, a Windows vulnerability that Microsoft indicated was 
used in both targeted espionage and opportunistic phishing campaigns 
with Ukraine\-related lures; 

• CVE\-2023\-23397, a critical elevation of privilege (NTLM hash leak) bug in 
Microsoft Outlook that Microsoft said was exploited by a Russia\-based APT 
for nearly a year in attacks on government entities, critical infrastructure 
providers, and military suppliers;

• CVE\-2023\-47246, a path traversal vulnerability in SysAid servers whose 
zero\-day exploitation Microsoft attributed to LaceTempest — the threat 
actor known for distributing Cl0p ransomware. 

CVE\-2023\-37580 was a reflected cross\-site scripting (XSS) bug disclosed 
in Zimbra Collaboration, a popular attack target, in June 2023\. According to 
Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), the vulnerability was used in at least 
four APT campaigns targeting government organizations in Greece, Moldova, 
Tunisia, Vietnam, and Pakistan. Google’s analysis includes a note on how 
“regular exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities in mail servers also shows a need for 
further code auditing of these applications, especially for XSS vulnerabilities.”

Finally, a spate of attacks on Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (formerly MobileIron 
Core), a mobile device management solution, garnered media and industry 
attention starting in July 2023 for three separate vulnerabilities disclosed over a 

17

10\-day period. The first (CVE\-2023\-35078\) was a critical authentication bypass 
that had been used in a zero\-day attack on a dozen Norwegian government 
ministries. Four days after CVE\-2023\-35078 was disclosed publicly and a 
patch released, Ivanti published a second advisory on CVE\-2023\-35081, an 
arbitrary file write issue that had been exploited in the wild and could be chained 
with CVE\-2023\-35078 to bypass administrator authentication. In the course 
of analyzing CVE\-2023\-35078, Rapid7 researchers discovered that it was 
still possible for a remote unauthenticated attacker to access API endpoints 
on an EPMM management server; the issue was assigned CVE\-2023\-35082\.

State\-Sponsored Threat Activity

Rapid7 researchers gather, analyze, and vet data from a wide range of sources for 
inclusion in a central threat library that supports Rapid7 products and services. 
Our data sources include dark web forums, private messaging platforms (e.g., 
Telegram), and public reports in addition to intelligence from private industry 
sources and Rapid7’s own managed services teams. 

This process includes rigorous analysis detailing the suspected source of said 
campaigns, with associated confidence of attribution. Between January 2023 
and March 2024, our analysis identified 188 separate campaigns in which we 
had a moderate to high confidence that the source originated from APT groups. 
“Moderate confidence” means that we have a significant amount of evidence 
that the activity we are observing is similar to what we have observed from a 
specific group or actor in the past; however, there is always a chance someone 
is mimicking behavior or conducting a false flag operation. 

Based on our analysis, we concluded that across the top 15 groups, 30% of 
attacks attributed to APT groups originated from Chinese\-backed campaigns. 
Campaigns from Russian\-affiliated groups came in a close second, comprising 
26% of campaigns conducted by state\-sponsored adversaries, while North 
Korea (14%) and Iran (9%) ranked third and fourth.

Ransomware

Ransomware payments were said to have topped $1 billion in 2023, with 
groups like Cl0p continuing to employ double extortion attacks that yield 
huge payouts and have allegedly racked up hundreds of millions in profit. The 
Rhysida ransomware group executed an attack on the British Library that took 
down systems for months, an incident attributed to LockBit disrupted British 
Royal Mail operations, and an estimated 100 million\+ American consumers 
became collateral damage from ransomware attacks targeting healthcare 
organizations in 2023\. 

18

Ransomware incident volume hasn’t decreased so far in 2024\. Already this year, 
Japanese car maker Nissan disclosed an Akira ransomware incident affecting 
roughly a hundred thousand people, U.S. government agencies published a joint 
warning on defending against Phobos ransomware affiliate operations, and an 
attack on two healthcare payment providers in France exposed the data of 33 
million citizens. In February, U.S.\-based healthcare payment provider Change 
Healthcare fell victim to a catastrophic attack attributed to the BlackCat (ALPHV) 
ransomware group; as of late March 2024, the incident was continuing to disrupt 
critical operations, contributing to hefty prescription backlogs, payment processing 
delays, and financial crises for smaller healthcare providers. 

Government action aimed at disrupting ransomware operations has also scaled 
up. In 2023 alone, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a multi\-national 
takedown of Qakbot malware infrastructure, the seizure of Hive ransomware 
servers and sites after a months\-long FBI infiltration of the group’s network, an 
international operation to disrupt BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware, and the indictment 
of multiple foreign nationals in connection with Conti ransomware and Trickbot 
malware operations — to name a few. 

In October 2023, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) 
announced that they had begun incorporating ransomware information into their 
Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) list; while the feature is relatively opaque and 
doesn’t list specific data sources (like the rest of KEV), CISA’s strictly conservative 
approach to adding new vulnerabilities to the KEV helps instill confidence that 
“Known” ransomware designations are well\-vetted. 

As of mid\-March 2024, the KEV list had 219 CVEs that the agency says are known 
to be used in ransomware attacks. The following chart shows KEV’s ransomware 
vulnerabilities broken down by CVE identifier year:

Rapid7 Labs conducted an analysis of 2023 ransomware attacks using data 
sourced from both external reports and intelligence from Rapid7 MDR. Our 
combined intelligence sources tracked nearly 5,600 reported ransomware 
cases between January 2023 and February 2024\. That number doesn’t account 
for the many attacks that inevitably go unreported, and therefore is probably 
much lower on paper than it is in reality. 

As Rapid7 Labs wrote in January 2024, the number of unique ransomware families 
these groups used in 2023 decreased by more than half, from 95 new families 
in 2022 to just 43 in 2023\. This implies that the current ransomware families 
and business models are profitable, and there may not be an immediate need 
to develop brand new capabilities. The below scatter plot shows the number 
of ransomware incidents attributed to the top 20 ransomware groups for 2023 
and early 2024, based on leak site communications, public disclosures, and 
Rapid7 incident response data.

Distribution of Posts Over Time by Top 20 Groups in 2023 and 2024

Unsurprisingly, LockBit 3\.0, a prolific ransomware\-as\-a\-service (RaaS) operation, 
continues to be the top group by sheer volume of activity. ALPHV, also known as 
BlackCat, also maintained a high incidence of activity throughout the year and 
into 2024, despite a U.S. government\-led effort to disrupt the group’s operations. 
The U.S. and UK announced in February 2024 that they had disrupted a LockBit 
ransomware variant. The Justice Department’s December 2023 press release on 
ALPHV disruption notes that the FBI made a government\-developed decryption 
tool available to hundreds of organizations, “saving multiple victims from ransom 

20

demands totaling approximately $68 million.” On March 27, 2024, as part of its 
“Rewards for Justice” program, the U.S. State Department announced a reward 
of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of 
BlackCat ransomware gang members.

As mentioned previously, we’ve seen a shift within the past year toward smash\-
and\-grab attacks targeting technologies like file transfer solutions where 
adversaries sought to quickly gain access to and exfiltrate data from corporate 
networks. More “traditional” ransomware incidents, where victim data was 
encrypted, also remained common; the vast majority of ransomware\-related 
incidents Rapid7 MDR responded to in the last year have included encryption, 
with only a small number of incidents ending in extortion alone. 

Exploiting a public\-facing application and having a valid account are the top 
initial access vectors we observed in ransomware and extortion attacks in 
2023\. Vulnerabilities that are known to have been abused by ransomware 
groups in 2023 and early 2024 include (but are not limited to) the CVEs below.

2023 Initial Access Vectors

While we expect ransomware groups to continue exploiting new and known 
vulnerabilities in public\-facing applications, there are still fundamental steps 
many organizations aren’t taking to protect themselves from ransomware or 
other attacks. 41% of incidents Rapid7 MDR observed in 2023 were the result 
of missing or unenforced multi\-factor authentication (MFA) on internet\-facing 
systems, particularly VPNs and virtual desktop infrastructure. This statistic has 
remained stable over the past year and a half, clocking in at 39% in 1H 2023 
before rising slightly in the back half of the year.

Rapid7 MDR analysts have also noted that threat actors overall have accelerated 
their operational timelines, particularly during ransomware incidents and extortion 
attacks. While adversary dwell time varied substantially across incidents 
Rapid7 MDR has investigated the past year, our analysts have observed that 
it’s becoming more common for attackers to move from initial access to data 
exfiltration in minutes or hours rather than days or weeks.

The end of this report contains practical security guidance to mitigate against 
the most common types of attacks Rapid7 incident responders see.

Life on the Edge: Network Pivots 2020 \- 2024

When Rapid7 published its inaugural vulnerability intelligence report in 2020, 
our research team created a specific attacker utility category for vulnerabilities 
in technologies that functioned as network pivots, providing opportunities for 
external attackers to gain internal network access. VPNs, firewalls, security 
gateways, and most network appliances fall into this category, along with several 
other internet\-facing technologies. These flaws are often used in conjunction 
with local code execution vulnerabilities or network protocol bugs to escalate 
privileges or move laterally across corporate networks.

Network edge technologies are essential for the operation of many modern 
networks, providing connectivity and security features for both corporate 
and home environments. But these devices also represent a significant weak 
spot in our cybersecurity defenses, as years of high\-profile exploitation have 
demonstrated so clearly. Attackers of all stripes and motivations have incentive to 
target these devices, and ransomware groups and state\-sponsored adversaries 
have both shown strong interest in n\-day and zero\-day exploit opportunities 
in these systems. 

2023 saw a surge in attacks on network appliances by various threat actors, 
including state\-sponsored groups and ransomware groups such as Cl0p, 
Inc, Bl00dy, Akira, Play, LockBit, and more. Payloads shared publicly in 2023 
spanned botnet malware and cryptominers alongside new webshells and 
proprietary backdoors.

Mass compromise events stemming from exploitation of network edge devices 
have almost doubled since the start of 2023, with 36% of all widely exploited 
2023 vulnerabilities occurring in network perimeter technologies. Network edge 
CVEs are also disproportionately represented across zero\-day attacks in our data 
— for the past three years, more than 60% of the vulnerabilities Rapid7 analyzed 
in network and security appliances each year were exploited as zero\-days.

Network pivot vulnerabilities have comprised 24% of exploited vulnerabilities in 
our cumulative dataset for the past four years, and a quarter of all widespread 
threats Rapid7 researchers have tracked since 2020\. For comparison, as best 
we can tell, approximately 19% of the CISA KEV consists of vulnerabilities in 
network edge devices or security gateways, about half of which were disclosed 
(and exploited) from 2020 onward — making network pivot prevalence in our 
data potentially a bit higher than in CISA’s data.

Below is the attacker utility distribution for the past four years of widespread 
threats:

Detecting intrusions on network appliances is notoriously fraught. The capabilities 
for logging and threat detection vary widely across devices, depending on the 
manufacturer and model. Some devices may not log key events or be able to 
detect malicious activities effectively. The variety of firmware versions and 
operating systems — many of them proprietary to the manufacturer — also 
add complexity, as does the fact that firmware or the entirety of a product may 
be encrypted or obfuscated. Each device can require a unique approach to 
monitoring and protection, presenting challenges for security teams looking to 
develop a comprehensive strategy that covers the full spectrum of appliances 
in use.

Attacker Utilities 2020\-2024 (Widespread Threats)Attacker Utilities

If you’re joining us for the first time, we map two additional types of metadata in our 
vulnerability dataset in addition to threat status and time to known exploitation. The 
first piece of metadata our researchers define when analyzing emergent threats is 
vulnerability class, which is useful for making initial assessments about relative 
exploitability and available tooling. The second type of metadata we add is attacker 
utility, which describes what an attacker can hope to gain as a result of successful 
exploitation. 

Network edge devices like VPNs and security gateways have been high\-value, high\-
frequency targets in both zero\-day and n\-day attacks over the past few years. This 
is abundantly obvious from our 2023 dataset, in which network pivot vulnerabilities 
tower over other attacker utility categories in both sheer number and incident impact.

Generic remote code execution vulnerabilities (i.e., CVEs that don’t map to a 
more specific bucket of utility, like supply chain compromise or smash\-and\-grab 
extortion) are predictably the largest category of attacker utility from the past 
four years, followed by network edge device compromise (network pivot). IT 
security management compromises, which map to CVEs that enable remote 
code execution or takeover of network or security management solutions, 
have been well\-represented among zero\-day exploits the past few years (e.g., 
Trend Micro Apex One CVE\-2023\-41179, Ivanti Sentry CVE\-2023\-38035, Zoho 
ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus CVE\-2022\-28810\) and have also made 
up a fair share of widespread threats (e.g., Cacti CVE\-2022\-46169, Zoho 
ManageEngine CVE\-2022\-47966\). 

While most of the vulnerabilities in this report affect on\-premise technologies, 
we’re starting to see cloud environment compromise show up more frequently 
in our threat analytics. Many of the CVEs we include in these reports also affect 
products that have cloud\-based versions available (e.g., Atlassian Confluence 
CVE\-2023\-22515 and CVE\-2023\-22518\), though typical vendor advisory 
wording tends to imply that cloud\-hosted versions of software are “not affected,” 
presumably because updates have been applied universally and there’s no 

26

Attacker Utility and Threat Status (2020\-2024\)Widespread ThreatThreataction the customer needs to take. As researcher Will Dormann pointed out 
in 2023, “not affected” is potentially a misnomer — there’s nothing magical 
about cloud\-hosted software that prevents adversaries from compromising 
organizations with zero\-day exploits before the vendor knows they exist, and to 
imply that orgs were never at risk from attacks that pre\-dated patch availability 
is misleading at best.

Vulnerability Classes

As in previous years, our dataset for this report skews heavily toward server\-
side vulnerabilities in popular enterprise technologies, many of which have 
previously been targeted by a range of threat actors. The way we compile our 
data also means that certain vulnerability classes are less represented than 
others; for example, 75% of the vulnerabilities Google included in their 2023 
“in\-the\-wild 0day” list arose from memory corruption issues, versus a mere 5% 
of the vulnerabilities in our data. If we were to expand our dataset to include 
mobile operating systems and client\-side issues like browser flaws, our root 
cause distribution would undoubtedly change quite a bit. 

Adversaries overall have demonstrated a clear 
penchant for well\-understood, easily accessible 
vulnerability classes that support stable, 
reliable, and often trivial exploit development.

Vulnerability Classes and Threat Status 2020\-2024Widespread ThreatThreat 
 
 
Fully 75% of the CVEs we’ve included in our annual vulnerability intelligence 
datasets the past four years have arisen from two superclasses of root cause: 
improper access control issues, like authentication bypasses, improper 
cryptographic implementations, and remotely accessible APIs; and injection 
flaws, which in our classification schema include root causes like server\-side 
request forgery (SSRF) and improper input validation in addition to SQL injection 
and command injection. Deserialization vulnerabilities, despite having only 
a single CWE (CWE\-502\) to their name, are disproportionately represented 
among high\-profile and widely exploited CVEs.

About 80% of the memory corruption CVEs Rapid7 researchers have analyzed 
since 2020 have been network edge device vulnerabilities and operating 
system\-level vulnerabilities (i.e., Windows vulns) — most of them (58%) zero\-
days. This isn’t terribly surprising when we consider that APTs tend to favor 
both memory corruption exploits and these types of target systems (i.e., OSes, 
network appliances). But plenty of APT and state\-sponsored attacks the past 
few years have leveraged simpler, more easily exploitable vulnerabilities, too, like 
authentication bypasses or SQL injection issues in enterprise web applications. 

Programming Language Distribution: 2023 
Vulnerabilities

Rapid7 researchers looked at the programming languages used across 60 
vulnerabilities from 2023 (see 2023 New Widespread Threats and Other Exploited 
Vulnerabilities for 2023 CVEs). Among those 60 CVEs, only eight languages 
are represented (we could not determine language used for three CVEs). Since 
C and C\+\+ are both memory\-unsafe languages and are analyzed in similar 
ways during root cause analysis, they are combined as C/C\+\+. Java and C/
C\+\+ account for two\-thirds of the notable vulnerabilities Rapid7 researchers 
analyzed over the past 15 months, with C\# and PHP distant runners\-up. Ruby, 
Go, and Lua are outliers, with a single CVE apiece.

Languages of Primary 2023 CVEsUnsurprisingly, Java is the most common language we see, representing 43% 
of our 2023 CVE data — almost double that of the second most common 
language group, C/C\+\+ (23%). Given Java’s continued popularity as an enterprise 
application development language, we’d expect Java and C/C\+\+ to remain the 
most prominent languages among critical enterprise software vulnerabilities 
for the foreseeable future.

One programming language that’s notably absent from our dataset is Rust — 
a memory\-safe, general purpose programming language that offers strong 
protections against memory corruption\-based vulnerability classes, such as 
buffer overflows or use\-after\-free vulnerabilities. The adoption of Rust is still 
in its infancy, with limited (but increasing) amounts of production code being 
shipped in operating systems, web browsers, and so on. We haven’t seen any 
Rust\-based enterprise software applications in production in the course of our 
research, but it’s a good bet that Rust will form an important part of secure 
software development in future years.

If we look at the vulnerability classes affecting each language, we see memory 
corruption as a root cause only in a small percentage of C/C\+\+\-based 
vulnerabilities. While some of this is down to the way we compile our data, it 
also shows that attackers are favoring easier and more reliable vulnerability 
classes when exploiting enterprise software. At the top of those easy and reliable 
classes is injection, which is the most common superclass we see across all 
languages represented in our data. In fact, command injection vulnerabilities 
have been so common the past few years that Metasploit released a new 
“fetch” payload in 2023 to simplify command injection exploitation.

29

Vulnerability Classes and Language of Primary 2023 CVEsUnknownInformation DisclosureOtherMemory CorruptionDeserializationInjectionImproper Access ControlThe second most common vulnerability superclass across almost all languages 
is improper access control. These are logical issues that allow an attacker to 
access resources they shouldn’t be able to. Improper access control is largely 
language\-agnostic — which makes it more difficult to mitigate holistically as 
a vulnerability class. 

Deserialization appears primarily in C\# and Java\-based vulnerabilities and 
offers a good example of the ways that programming languages can help 
prevent entire classes of vulnerabilities. For example, .NET 8 has disabled the 
BinaryFormatter by default — this is often the root cause of deserialization 
vulnerabilities in C\# code bases. Java 17 has also broken many common 
deserialization gadgets by introducing restrictions on reflective access. 
Enterprise software is historically slow to update major dependencies like 
Java, which in turn slows the uptake of language\-specific protections that 
prevent deserialization vulnerabilities more broadly in the software ecosystem. 
Nevertheless, we would hope that deserialization vulnerability prevalence will 
decrease over time as software producers move to more modern versions of 
core dependencies with better runtime protections built in.

Government Guidance on Eliminating Key 
Vulnerability Classes

In the last few months, both CISA and the White House Office of the National 
Cyber Director (ONCD) have published missives on the importance of moving 
away from languages that are susceptible to memory safety issues (e.g., 
C/C\+\+) in favor of memory\-safe languages like Java, C\#, Rust, and several 
others. This is beneficial advice at large, and may be in part directed at critical 
infrastructure providers whose risk profile has turned more volatile in recent 

30

years; this guidance is also relevant for some network appliances that are 
written in C/C\+\+. But it’s also worth noting that the majority of widely exploited 
vulnerabilities we’ve seen since 2021 have been in products already written in 
memory\-safe languages — namely Java and C\#. 

Non\-memory\-corruption\-based vulnerabilities are more difficult to mitigate at 
the language level, meaning attackers will always have opportunities to exploit 
logical issues in software irrespective of the underlying language. In March 
2024, CISA and the FBI released a joint advisory urging software vendors to 
perform formal reviews of their products' source code to detect and remediate 
SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities. This, of course, is also generally good 
advice, particularly since SQLi vulnerabilities have starred in recent high\-profile 
exploit chains like MOVEit Transfer CVE\-2023\-34362 and Fortinet FortiClient 
CVE\-2023\-48788 (the latter of which didn’t make the data cut\-off for this 
report). Many SQLi vulnerabilities are also considered “low\-hanging fruit” for 
penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, and product security code reviewers. 

With that said, the CISA KEV list appears to have incorporated a mere three 
SQLi vulnerabilities in 2023, and only one has made it onto the KEV as of March 
2024\. Rapid7 vulnerability intelligence datasets for the past three years have 
similarly only included three major SQLi flaws (SonicWall SMA 100 Series 
CVE\-2021\-20016, Progress Software MOVEit Transfer CVE\-2023\-34362, and 
Accellion FTA CVE\-2021\-27101\), though admittedly all three were broadly 
exploited as zero\-days, and Accellion FTA and MOVEit Transfer were used in 
Cl0p mass extortion campaigns. 

All in all, there seems to be some disparity between vulnerability classes that 
have been the focus of government guidance and vulnerability classes that 
are disproportionately represented and exploited in enterprise software, like 
command injection issues. Given CISA’s (and other agencies’) mission scope, 
however, it’s entirely possible that enterprise software vulnerabilities are not 
the primary target of government\-issued guidelines, even if certain categories 
of enterprise technology (e.g., network appliances) would also benefit from 
their application. Enterprise software manufacturers should heed government\-
issued guidance while also keeping other prevalent vulnerability classes in mind 
during development, static analysis, and security testing.

Practical Guidance 
for Defenders 

Implement, test, and enforce MFA as a top priority. More than 40% of 
incidents Rapid7 investigated in 2023 were the result of missing or inconsistent 
enforcement of MFA, particularly on VPN, VDI, and SaaS products. Rapid7 MDR 
has also observed an uptick in MFA push fraud as a result of notification fatigue. 
Many MFA vendors offer number matching as a way to prevent MFA fatigue. 
Organizations should implement and enforce MFA everywhere it’s supported; if 
it’s not supported on key technologies your organization uses, consider asking 
your suppliers to make it a part of future roadmaps.

Don’t trust, do verify. Organizations should apply principles of least privilege by 
moving to models that don’t assume or imply trust — e.g., by making allowlisting 
the standard operating procedure rather than blocklisting, implementing granular 
access control, regularly reviewing (and removing!) users and access levels, 
and so on. 

Be aggressive about continually reducing internet exposure. If it’s on the internet, 
take it off if at all possible. Anything exposed to the public internet — ports, 
services, interfaces, concentrators, appliances, etc. — should be considered a 

32

target for adversary enumeration and exploitation, as well as a potential target 
for zero\-day attacks. Scan everything, externally and internally; if you can’t take 
it off the internet, then look at vendor guidance on hardening configurations. 

A strong proactive vulnerability risk management program is essential — 
in the cloud, on\-prem, and everywhere in between. Robust vulnerability 
management is one of the foundations for any successful security program. 
Without the proactive discipline of vulnerability management and strong routine 
patch management practices, it can be prohibitively difficult for organizations 
to up\-level to effective emergency patching in times of crisis. Having solid 
inventory and asset management practices is also essential, since it’s difficult 
to act decisively in a crisis without knowing if the affected product is even 
present in an environment. Identify and catalog your critical and exposed 
systems, including security boundary devices, internet\-facing load balancers, 
devops tooling and pipeline solutions, and virtualization infrastructure. For more 
fundamentals, read Rapid7’s guidance on security program basics.

Implement “zero\-day” patching procedures for critical technologies. Network 
edge devices are at particular risk of n\-day and zero\-day exploitation, and 
vulnerabilities in these devices should be mitigated as soon as vendor\-provided 
patches or workarounds are available. Ensuring that logging is enabled 
and working will help security teams more effectively hunt for indicators of 
compromise and other suspicious activity during incidents. 

Double (or triple) your backup strategy. Ransomware has reached pandemic 
levels worldwide, with healthcare and critical infrastructure at particularly 
high risk. Organizations can bolster ransomware readiness and resilience 
by maintaining multiple backups, including backups that are offsite and not 
connected to corporate networks. While this may not stop a ransomware attack, 
having uncompromised backups gives organizations more options during a 
major incident and may help deter business leaders from paying a ransom.

One of the most important ways organizations can mitigate catastrophic 
data theft and extortion risk in the face of a mature, highly motivated threat 
ecosystem is to put measures in place to identify and prevent data exfiltration 
wherever possible. 

This includes (but is not limited to):

• Alerting on or restricting unusually large file uploads; looking for large 

volumes of traffic to a single IP or domain

• Monitoring for unusual access to cloud storage (ex: Google Drive, SharePoint, 

ShareFile)

• Monitoring for or adding firewall rules to block known file sharing sites (ex: 

filetransfer\[.]io, anonfiles\[.]com, mega\[.]nz)

33

• Monitoring for data transfer utility presence or usage (ex: Filezilla, WinSCP/

Putty, MegaCMD, BITS, etc.)

• Monitoring for data archiving utility presence and usage (ex: 7zip, WinRAR, 

WinZip, etc.)

• Implementing egress filtering
• Restricting local admin privileges on hosts

Appendix

The data upon which this report is based does not include all CVEs or threats 
Rapid7 evaluated in any given year, but it does represent a diverse sample of 
attacker use cases and exploitation case studies, with heavy emphasis on 
widespread attacks. Our intent is not to imply that any one CVE or vulnerability 
group is less important than others. Security teams, network administrators, 
and defenders at large have in\-depth understanding of which assets are critical 
in their environments and how action taken may affect their business priorities. 
What we offer is an attacker\-centric view of the vulnerability landscape that 
Rapid7 customers and the security community can use to inform the policies 
and practices that they employ as part of a larger defense\-in\-depth strategy.

Notes on Methodology

Most CVEs featured in this report were exploited in the wild in 2023 and/or the 
first two months of 2024\. The CVEs we have categorized as exploited in the 
wild in this report are not the only vulnerabilities to have been exploited during 
2023 and 2024\. For example, we exclude many small business technologies 
(e.g., small business routers) that are frequently featured on in\-the\-wild lists. We 
also exclude most browser, mobile, and host\-based vulnerabilities known to be 
exploited in the wild (e.g., bugs in Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Firefox, or bugs 
in iOS and macOS), in addition to exploited vulnerabilities in applications like 
Adobe Flash Player and Adobe Acrobat. Google Project Zero has a spreadsheet 
of some other zero\-days exploited in the wild in 2023 here, with more of a focus 
on browser, mobile, and host\-based vulnerabilities. 

Since the trustworthiness of our data is important, we cite primary sources 
wherever possible for vulnerabilities we’ve listed as exploited in the wild—that 
is, we reference firsthand accounts of exploitation from the organizations or 
individuals who detected, verified, and reported them. Examples of primary 
sources referenced throughout this paper include U.S. cybersecurity and 
intelligence agency alerts on known exploitation; security firm analyses of 
threats and indicators of compromise (IOCs) they’ve tracked during incident 
response or other investigations; and vendor advisories that specify exploitation 
in the wild (this includes CVEs that are disclosed as zero\-days). 

35

In the interest of readability, in some cases we also cite articles in security news 
publications that aggregate disparate reports of exploitation. This is especially 
useful when certain vulnerabilities are so widely exploited that it is helpful to 
see them contextualized in a single article. Our goal in citing news sources 
is to allow readers to understand the volume and impact of exploitation as 
quickly as possible. 

Threat Categorization

In most cases, widespread threats are vulnerabilities under attack by many 
bad actors. Prior to January 2022, we categorized any CVE that was leveraged 
by ransomware operators as a widespread threat, since ransomware was 
generically considered to be an at\-scale operation that relies on volume to 
profit. This policy was changed in 2022 to accommodate evolving statistics 
on targeted ransomware. From 2023 onward, instead of relying on the number 
of known attackers, we use the volume of known real\-world compromises 
to differentiate widespread threats from other exploited vulnerabilities. This 
change was largely to account for the rising number of mass compromise 
events orchestrated by a single threat actor (e.g., Cl0p). 

Threats categorized as “exploited in the wild” are, quite simply, not known to 
be broadly exploited at time of writing. It is possible that concrete technical 
evidence of broader exploitation exists but has not been shared publicly. 
Likewise, while we do not have evidence at time of writing that CVEs in our 
impending threat category are exploited in the wild, lack of evidence does not 
mean absence of exploitation.

Ransomware Citations

We use security news articles frequently to document ransomware operators’ use 
of specific CVEs. Ransomware citations in this report are a binary — either there 
is credible technical evidence of ransomware groups’ usage of a vulnerability 
or there is not. Lack of confirmation does not mean a CVE has not been used 
in ransomware operations, only that we have not seen independently verifiable 
details supporting that conclusion. Credible sources typically include some 
combination of original analysis, news articles that aggregate primary sources 
to frame a larger story about risk, and expert commentary on open platforms 
(e.g., social media, user forums, and other public comments). In general, 
when a report comes from an individual or a little\-known entity rather than a 
recognized expert, we look for technical information like payloads, observed 
post\-exploitation behavior, threat actor attribution, IOCs, and/or attack chain 
analysis to support the claim.

36

Calculating Time to Known Exploitation (TTKE)

Compiling and communicating timelines is one of the most difficult parts 
of risk assessment. When calculating Time to Known Exploitation (TTKE), 
wherever possible we will attempt to use the first credible public reference to a 
vulnerability’s existence and the first credible public reference to exploitation in 
the wild. Often the first and most authoritative source on the existence of a new 
CVE is a vendor advisory, but in this age of widespread zero\-day exploitation 
and public discourse, community references can pre\-date vendor bulletins. 
The initial two ProxyNotShell vulnerabilities (CVE\-2022\-41040 and CVE\-2022\-
41082\) are an example of this. Rarely if ever do we use sources like the National 
Vulnerability Database (NVD) for disclosure baseline dates, since those dates 
tend to be days or weeks behind public (and therefore attacker) knowledge. 

Important: The first known report of exploitation is just that—the first known 
report. It’s possible, and in many cases likely, that exploitation began before a 
public analysis was released. TTKE data should not be taken as evidence that 
a vulnerability was NOT exploited before the observed date. 

Glossary of Terms

Threat Statuses

Widespread threat: A vulnerability or other exploitable condition that is used 
to compromise many organizations across multiple industry verticals and/or 
geolocations. 

Threat: In cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) parlance, a threat exists when there is 
an adversary with the intent, capability, and opportunity to act. In the context of 
vulnerability research, we use “threat” to denote a vulnerability or other attack 
vector that adversaries have used to exploit real\-world production environments, 
but that has not necessarily been used to compromise large numbers of 
organizations. “Threat” can also refer to the entity doing the attacking, like an 
APT or ransomware group.

Impending threat: A vulnerability or other attack vector that is not yet known to 
be exploited in the wild, but that we believe is likely to be exploited in the future. 
Most impending threats in Rapid7 research are vulnerabilities in technologies 
that frequently come under attack (e.g., network edge devices) and/or have 
known exploits or other tooling available. 

37

Attacker Utilities

Cloud environment compromise: Remote code execution or takeover of cloud 
accounts, cloud gateways, or API management products. Replaces cloud 
infrastructure compromise as of 2023\. 

Information disclosure: The ability to leak sensitive data (e.g., credentials 
or other secrets, environment variables) and/or enumerate files on a target. 
Information disclosure vulnerabilities typically do not give an attacker a path to 
code execution by themselves, but instead function as primitives that enable 
a secondary part of an exploit chain (e.g., remote code execution). Can aid in 
turning a post\-authentication vulnerability into a pre\-authentication vulnerability.

IT security management compromise: Remote code execution or takeover 
of network, device, and/or endpoint management technologies; remote code 
execution or takeover of identity and access management solutions, including 
single sign\-on (SSO) and Active Directory (AD) management solutions, or other 
security products. Replaces network infrastructure compromise as of 2022\. 

Network pivot: The ability to pivot from an external network to an internal 
network, most often by exploiting internet\-facing systems such as VPNs, 
firewalls, routers, and other gateway devices. A network pivot gives an attacker 
visibility into both internal and external traffic and aids in data exfiltration, traffic 
sniffing, and further attacks within the target network. 

Privilege escalation: The ability to run code locally on a system to which the 
attacker already has some access. Most commonly used to escalate privileges 
(e.g., by executing code as the user running the vulnerable application). Replaces 
local code execution as of 2023\. 

Remote code execution (RCE): Code execution on a remote target. Typically 
refers to the ability to execute a payload on a target system (e.g., obtain a shell 
session). Aids in credential stealing, data exfiltration, and so on.

Smash\-and\-grab extortion: New attacker utility in 2023 data onward; describes 
a vulnerability in a file sharing platform or secure/managed file transfer 
application (cloud or on\-premises) that allows adversaries to gain access to 
the target system and quickly exfiltrate potentially large amounts of data. Often 
targeted in ransomware and extortion attacks. 

Social engineering: Encompasses vulnerabilities that typically require a user 
to click on or preview a malicious attachment for successful exploitation to 
occur (e.g., email\-based or document\-based attacks). 

Supply chain compromise: New attacker utility in 2023 data onward; refers 
to a vulnerability that allows for takeover of CI/CD pipelines or other critical 
software supply chain infrastructure, or a verified incident in which a legitimate 
piece of software was backdoored or otherwise maliciously modified.

Vulnerability Classes

Deserialization is the process through which an application is able to convert 
data from a portable format to data types native to its own language. Many 
modern languages support deserialization, including Java, .NET, Python, and 
Ruby. The deserialization process can pose a threat to security when the data 
that is loaded into the native language can be tampered with by a malicious 
party. Typical attacks involve configuring the data to invoke a method with the 
arguments necessary to execute an operating system command. This results 
in command execution in the context of the loading application. Common 
solutions to this security problem include cryptographically signing the data to 
ensure its authenticity and utilizing an allowlist of data types that are permitted 
to be loaded. Associated CWEs: CWE\-502

Improper Access Control refers to a missing or insufficient access control 
to a particular interface into a system (most often a remotely accessible 
API). Improper uses of cryptography for the purpose of authentication also 
fall under this vulnerability class. Common solutions to this problem include 
proper authentication, authorization, and accounting implementations for all 
sensitive interfaces, as well as secure management of all related secrets. A non\-
exhaustive list of associated CWEs: CWE\-285, CWE\-200, CWE\-287, CWE\-732

Memory Corruption is a large category of vulnerabilities that involve the misuse 
of data through a variety of means to alter memory and produce unexpected 
behavior. This vulnerability class includes improper boundary enforcement, type 
confusion, uninitialized data use, and the use of data after it has been freed, to 
name a few. These vulnerabilities often manifest themselves in languages that 
are not considered memory\-safe. Successful exploitation of memory corruption 
vulnerabilities can result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the 
running application, or in an unhandled exception that causes the application to 
crash and triggers a denial of service (DoS) condition. Common solutions to this 
problem typically involve additional validation on parameters to key operations, 
such as those used to load and store data. Successful exploitation of these 
classes of vulnerabilities has become more complex in recent years due to 
the variety of mitigation technologies that have been developed for operating 
systems, compilers, and applications (e.g., kASLR, Control Flow Guard, win32k 
Type Isolation). A non\-exhaustive list of associated CWEs: CWE\-787, CWE\-125, 
CWE\-416, CWE\-190, CWE\-476

39

Injection is a large category of vulnerabilities involving specially crafted input 
that is interpreted in a particular way by an associated system. Most commonly 
seen in web applications, injection attacks are often more specifically labeled 
by the type of data being interpreted (e.g., SQL, LDAP, OS commands). The root 
cause of these vulnerabilities is almost always insufficient sanitization on data 
received from a malicious party. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities tends to 
be reliable, rarely resulting in service degradation unless intended (such as 
through SQL or OS commands).

The context under which the logic is executed typically depends on how it is 
interpreted. In the case of a web application, for example, SQL injection may be 
executed on a back\-end database server, while OS commands are injected on 
the front\-end web server, and JavaScript is executed by the end user’s browser. 
This class of vulnerabilities is therefore unique in that it commonly involves 
a vulnerability in one system compromising the integrity of others. Common 
solutions to this problem typically involve implementing strict sanitization on 
parameters through the use of allowlists. A non\-exhaustive list of associated 
CWEs: CWE\-79, CWE\-20, CWE\-89, CWE\-94
