## 25 Years of Research at NCC Group
Andy Davis,
Global Research Director
The research we have published over the last 25 years highlights the significant role NCC 
Group has played in the cybersecurity world due to our coverage of a wide array of topics, 
deep technical insights, and practical applications. 
As it constitutes an extensive body of knowledge, I enlisted 
the help of OpenAI’s ChatGPT to help me summarise the 
content. Here’s what we came up with as an overview of 
how our work has impacted cybersecurity since 1999:
Addressing Current and Emerging Threats
We dive into detailed analysis and mitigation strategies 
for both current and emerging cybersecurity threats. 
This includes advanced persistent threats (APTs), 
exploitation of new and existing vulnerabilities in software 
and hardware, and the increasing concerns around IoT 
security. By focusing on real-world threats, we have helped 
organisations prepare and defend against sophisticated 
attacks.
Enhancing Secure Development Practices
With multiple publications focusing on secure coding 
practices, secure development lifecycle, and specific 
programming guidance, our research has been 
instrumental in elevating the security standards of software 
development across industries. This has become ever 
more important as software is increasingly becoming 
integral to our everyday lives.
Promoting Cryptographic Security
The exploration of cryptographic algorithms, quantum 
cryptography, and secure communications protocols 
is vital for secure digital transactions. As cyber threats 
evolve, maintaining robust cryptographic practices is key 
to ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of our sensitive 
information.
Forensics and Incident Response
The detailed forensic analyses provided in our publications 
are essential for understanding how breaches occur and 
how to effectively respond to them. This knowledge is used 
by incident response teams to quickly mitigate damage 
and for ongoing efforts to enhance detection and response 
capabilities within organisations.
Guidance on Compliance and Best Practices
Our research includes discussions on security compliance, 
regulations, and best practices which are essential for 
organisations to not only meet mandatory regulatory 
requirements but also to adopt industry-leading security 
practices. This helps in fostering a security-aware culture 
within organisations and in building robust security 
frameworks that protect against breaches and data theft.
Educational Impact
By providing in-depth technical knowledge, case studies, 
and research insights, our publications serve as valuable 
educational resources for security professionals, 
researchers, and students. They contribute to the broader 
understanding of complex cybersecurity topics, which is 
important for training the next generation of cybersecurity 
professionals.
Overall, our contribution through these publications significantly impacts many aspects of cybersecurity by advancing 
knowledge, shaping industry standards, improving security practices, and driving technological and methodological 
innovations in the field. Hopefully, our work not only assists organisations in defending against dynamic and sophisticated 
cyber threats but also plays a crucial role in the academic and research-oriented advancements in cybersecurity, 
ultimately helping to build a more secure and resilient future.

## Hardware and Embedded Systems
The Hardware and Embedded Systems team continued 
to research a broad range of topics over 2024, ranging 
from wireless communication protocols to confidential 
computing to reverse engineering of binaries for 
uncommon architectures. The team published numerous 
blog posts, new and improved tooling, and multiple 
conference talks over the past year. Notable highlights 
include:
	
- Reverse engineering and identifying vulnerabilities 
	 in the PowerG radio protocol: James Chambers and 
	 Sultan Qasim Khan reverse engineered the 
	 proprietary PowerG radio protocol used by Johnson 
	 Controls alarm systems and identified exploitable 
	 weaknesses in the protocol and popular devices using 
	 it. Findings were presented at the Recon 2024 
	 conference.
	
- Over-the-air exploitation of Sonos devices: Robert 
	 Herrera, together with Alex Plaskett of the Exploit 
	 Development Group (EDG), identified a vulnerability in 
	 the Wi-Fi stack of a Sonos device and developed an 
	 over-the-air exploit that enabled covert listening. This 
	 research was presented at Black Hat USA 2024. 
	 Details of this project are discussed further in this 
	 report among other projects by the EDG.
	
- Development of tooling to reverse engineer 
	 binaries for the NanoMIPS ISA: James Chambers 
	 and Robert Herrera developed and released the first 
	 public tooling for reverse engineering of binaries 
	 targeting the NanoMIPS ISA, which is gaining 
	 prominence for its use in MediaTek 5G basebands.
	
- Public report analyzing the eBPF verifier: Nathaniel 
	 Theis and Chris Anley conducted an in-depth security 
	 assessment of the eBPF verifier that validates

Edge Devices
Previously, in 2023, we saw an uptick in compromised 
edge devices, such as VPN gateways, firewalls, and routers. 
As predicted back then, this trend continued this year 
with even greater force. As these devices are still mostly 
a network’s first line of defence, being able to properly 
investigate them after a breach is important for scope- and 
root-cause analysis. Building on previous years’ experience, 
we improved our analysis and response capabilities for 
edge devices, enabling us to technically deep dive these 
systems just as well as other systems in a client’s network!
Looking forward, we want to focus on creating more 
visibility by leveraging our current Network Detection 
and Response (NDR) and Security Information and Event 
Management (SIEM) monitoring capabilities to proactively 
monitor and alert our customers about threats that are 
specific to these edge devices.
Leading Forensic Analysis Innovation
In 2022, we released our Digital Forensics & Incident 
Response (DFIR) framework, Dissect, to the public, enabling 
DFIR analysts across the globe to seamlessly analyze and 
collect data from any type of system. Currently, Dissect 
is widely adopted within the DFIR community and is even 
included in well-regarded training courses from institutes 
like SANS. We are continuously expanding and improving 
upon Dissect with the community, to provide the industry 
with bleeding edge innovations within the field of DFIR, 
such as hypervisor-based data acquisition and analysis. 
Most of our innovations have mainly focused on host 
analysis and acquisition. We believe that memory analysis 
and acquisition is still a largely underexplored topic, and its 
analysis remains cumbersome within the industry. 
Currently we are making advancements in this area, with 
the goal to make the analysis and acquisition of memory 
artefacts as seamless as host analysis and acquisition 
currently is with Dissect. Additionally, we are also increasing 
our operational technology (OT) analysis capabilities by 
adding support for OT specific systems.
APT Tracking
Based on past incident response (IR) cases involving 
the advanced persistent threat (APT) group Lazarus, we 
started to track this threat actor together with our threat 
intelligence (TI) team. We discovered that the specific threat 
actor we were tracking is a Lazarus subgroup publicly 
known as AppleJeus, which targets the cryptocurrency and 
trading industry. 
We managed to identify a new AppleJeus campaign in 2024 
and warn several organizations proactively to help stop 
further compromise. We presented and shared our unique 
insights about this actor and malware at the FIRST 2024 
conference. 
We plan to keep tracking this additional subgroup with 
our current knowledge and share information with other 
organizations and law enforcement.
Scanning the Internet
We are continuously scanning the Internet for malicious 
servers to feed into our security operations centre (SOC), 
DFIR and TI teams with curated indicators on these servers. 
This includes new signatures for tools and malware 
commonly used by threat actors or that we have identified 
during incident response cases. In 2024, we have heavily 
improved this pipeline. 
Now, this same scanning pipeline is also used for 
vulnerability research. For example, we routinely identify 
and fingerprint edge devices on the Internet to provide 
statistics that can help estimate the impact a vulnerability 
could have and whether our customers are affected by it.
Looking forward to 2025, we plan to keep improving our 
internet scanning capabilities and the processing of scan 
results. We want to publish more of this scan data we 
automatically collect with this pipeline, allowing the industry 
to also leverage this data for a more secure digital future.
Improving Threat Hunting
We worked on creating a readable and structured 
way to record indicators of compromise, allowing for 
programmatic parsing thereof. This idea stems from the 
need for recording indicators of compromise quickly and 
easily by forensic investigators, while also allowing these 
indicators to be ingested by other tools, e.g., detection 
platforms or internal tooling. 
This helps in the overall picture as it allows us to more 
easily use such indicators in the various detection 
platforms we are currently using. The diversification 
of detection platforms requires a unified approach to 
performing searches of indicators. We plan to simplify 
and improve the process of threat hunting, in terms of 
processing indicators and performing threat hunts.
Network Detection and Response
In recent years, endpoint detection and response (EDR) 
and extended detection and response (XDR) have taken 
a larger role in detecting threat actors at the SOC. We still 
believe that network detection is a vital part in catching 
these actors. This is also what we observe internally within 
our NDR customer base. Albeit the ever-increasing use of 
encryption, we remain able to effectively leverage our NDR 
capabilities to detect lateral movement in their internal 
network and notify our customers about threats. This is 
especially important for systems like edge devices, which 
gained the interest of threat actors as an initial point of 
entry. Combined with the fact that agent- and log-based 
monitoring brings about their own set of challenges, we 
believe NDR is especially effective here.
In addition to creating new detection signatures and 
improving existing ones, we also improved our detection 
signature accuracy by researching automated detection 
rule validation testing using internally developed tooling. 
Looking forward, we want to improve our OT network 
detection capabilities to broaden our NDR coverage.

## Security Research Services 
Jon Renshaw,
Security Research Services Director
NCC Group 2024 Research Report
encourages investment in improved cybersecurity 
capabilities at manufacturers.
Telecommunications and Internet Security: It has 
been a turbulent year in telecommunications security; 
for one, we saw a key implementation date of the UK 
Telecommunications Security Act (TSA) pass for tier 1 
providers in March. But before that notable date, we saw 
a novel Denial of Service (DoS) attack against Orange 
España in January, using compromised credentials to 
reconfigure the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), 
a technology deployed for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) 
route validation.
NCC Group’s research into the security of 5G Testbeds 
and Trials (5GTT) in the UK was published by the 
Department of Science, Innovation and Technology 
(DSIT)[^5] and showed the value of integrating cybersecurity 
expertise into research programmes to identify gaps 
and help remove roadblocks to developing technology 
beneficial to all.
During the Olympics in France, we saw network outages 
as a result of physical attacks on fibre optic infrastructure, 
highlighting that physical security is still an important 
element of risk management and cyber resilience in 
highly distributed systems such as telecommunications 
networks.
In September, the White House released a “Roadmap 
to Enhance Internet Routing Security”, advocating 
for wider adoption of RPKI as a “mature, ready-to-
implement approach to mitigate vulnerabilities in BGP”. 
However, in December, they announced that eight US 
telecommunications providers had been the victims of a 
China-backed hacking and espionage campaign targeting 
top political figures, with work ongoing to ensure the 
hackers had been removed from the compromised 
environments.
Quantum Computing & Post-Quantum Cryptography: 
NIST finalized the first standards from the Post-Quantum 
Cryptography (PQC) competition, providing a foundation 
for organisations to begin to migrate away from the 
current generation of quantum insecure algorithms. 
The migration has already begun in the internet 
ecosystem with Chrome leading the way on adoption 
of the hybrid scheme X25519Kyber768Draft006 but 
enterprise support will lag behind as organisations 
need to update their configurations and supporting 
cryptographic infrastructure. NCC Group continues to 
collaborate with industry partners on the security of 
quantum computing through the quantum datacentre 
of the future project, looking at both quantum use cases 
in cybersecurity, and the security of quantum computers 
and their supporting infrastructure.
Privacy Enhancing Technologies: NCC Group is 
assuring TikTok’s implementations of cutting-edge Privacy 
Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as part of Project Clover, 
a high-profile and complex programme that aims to give 
users in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and 
the United Kingdom assurance and confidence that their 
data is being kept safe and secure.
Differential privacy is one of the controls being used to 
secure aggregated user statistics (alongside other controls 
such as encryption and redaction for individual data) to 
protect users’ privacy and provides strong theoretical 
guarantees of privacy for individuals represented by 
an aggregate dataset. Our researchers and testers are 
rigorously assuring the TikTok design and implementation 
of PETs, that are being implemented at scale, to protect 
over 175 million European users.
2024 has been an interesting and varied year, highlighting 
the overlap of cybersecurity with public life, and raising 
awareness of how attackers might impinge upon our 
freedoms as citizens and businesses. Some of the key 
themes of the year and their relationship to cybersecurity 
research services at NCC Group include:
The threat from disinformation: With such a bumper 
year for elections, disinformation and deepfakes were 
near the top of the list of potential threats likely to impact 
on civil society and democracy in 2024. While instances 
of deepfakes were observed during many of the national 
elections, it transpired that the quantity and impact 
of such disinformation was probably less than many 
expected (noting this is very hard to objectively measure). 
Perhaps the bigger impacts have been on fraud, with 
high-profile attacks on enterprises and increasing 
evidence of deepfakes being used in celebrity investment 
scams and romance scams.
Efforts to develop technologies to detect deepfakes 
continues with both the UK[^1] and US[^2] governments 
investing in research into emerging technology 
capabilities. NCC Group also joined the Coalition for 
Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)[^3] in 2024, 
providing cybersecurity insights into this developing 
approach aimed at embedding provenance metadata into 
digital content.  
The safety and security of Artificial Intelligence: 
Generative AI continued to develop at pace in 2024, 
prompting global efforts to establish regulations and 
organisations capable of managing emerging risks.  
This includes understanding AI’s capabilities to, either 
autonomously or as an aide to a human in the loop, 
provide an uplift in cyber attackers’ ability to effectively or 
efficiently compromise targets. 
Our own previous research has shown that whilst there is 
a potential uplift in vulnerability research, it really requires 
an expert to parse, understand, and explore the outputs 
of AI model analysis of code. While model developers and 
deployers continue to innovate, governments have acted. 
The EU has passed the AI Act, with key implementation 
dates throughout 2025, 2026 and 2027, and various 
governments have created organisations tasked with 
understanding, monitoring, and developing mitigations for 
the risks posed by AI.
This year, NCC Group carried out research on behalf of 
Google into how the risks to AI models change when 
models are deployed on edge and personal computing 
devices.[^4] Our research concluded that whilst moving 
capability to the edge can result in performance and 
privacy improvements, it also creates a complex new 
attack surface with potential for hardware and side-
channel vulnerabilities in GPUs and malware embedded 
in GPU programs.
Security of Connected Devices: Two significant pieces 
of legislation became law in the UK and the EU in 
2024. The Product Security and Telecommunications 
Infrastructure (PSTI) Act mandates some basic controls for 
smart devices sold to consumers in the UK, including no 
default passwords and transparency around vulnerability 
reporting and security support. The Cyber Resilience Act 
goes even further, including requirements for secure-by-
design for connected devices sold into the EU. 
Over many years, NCC Group has researched the security 
of connected consumer and enterprise devices, often 
finding poor security hygiene and a lack of maturity in 
processes, including vulnerability disclosure and patch 
management. Looking forward, future research will 
hopefully reveal a step change in attitudes towards 
developing devices with security built in, as this legislation

## Future Research
The future of security research is ambitious, focusing 
on emerging technologies, evolving threats, and 
more proactive defence mechanisms. At the same 
time, addressing data protection fatigue will require a 
paradigm shift in how security is delivered—making it 
simpler, seamless, and less reliant on user action. By 
marrying cutting-edge research with human-centered 
design, the industry can tackle both challenges head-
on, ensuring a safer and more user-friendly digital 
landscape.
Individuals are constantly bombarded with privacy 
notifications, security warnings, and breach alerts. 
Whether it’s endless cookie consent pop-ups, multi-step 
authentication processes, or navigating complex privacy 
settings, the sheer volume of decisions users must make 
often leaves them feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. 
This overload can lead to disengagement, where users 
either ignore warnings or make suboptimal security 
choices because they feel powerless to control their data 
effectively. The frustration of keeping up with constantly 
evolving threats while relying on tools that demand 
significant time and effort only exacerbates this fatigue.
As many grow weary of managing their data security 
and finding trust in corporations, stricter guidelines on 
how organizations handle data are requested more and 
more. 
Laws such as the GDPR and CCPA pushed companies 
to take on greater responsibility for securing user 
information and providing transparency, and ISO 
standards give idealized guidelines. Future legislation 
will likely follow. Security researchers and developers 
will play a critical role in helping businesses comply with 
these laws, creating tools and frameworks to detect 
potential violations and ensure adherence to evolving 
regulatory standards.
Building trust through transparency will be crucial.

This article explores the reverse engineering 
of the classic game Warcraft 2 to identify 
potential security vulnerabilities. Due to 
its age and the lack of modern security 
features like anti-cheat mechanisms, 
Warcraft 2 provides an accessible platform 
for learning basic game hacking techniques. 
The author outlines a methodology that 
includes defining clear goals, such as 
uncovering bugs that could be exploited 
during multiplayer sessions, and reviewing 
existing research to build upon prior 
findings. The analysis also involves 
assessing the game’s attack surface, 
particularly its peer-to-peer networking 
model, and using tools to examine the code 
and behavior for exploitable flaws.

The research highlights critical security 
weaknesses in the Sonos Era 100’s bootloader 
that could be exploited to achieve full device 
compromise. The security vulnerabilities found 
are on weaknesses within its bootloader. 
These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to 
gain unauthorized root or kernel-level code 
execution, leading to a complete compromise 
of the device. By updating their devices 
with the latest firmware released by Sonos, 
users can protect themselves from these 
vulnerabilities.
This TA highlights 18 critical vulnerabilities 
in PandoraFMS Enterprise v7.0NG.767, 
including unauthenticated admin account 
takeover, remote code execution, XSS, SQL 
injection, and more. Users are advised to 
update to the latest version and implement 
recommended security measures to protect 
their systems.
Memory scanning involves examining the 
memory of running processes to identify 
specific patterns, which is essential for 
tasks like credential access, malware 
detection, and data recovery. However, 
conducting comprehensive memory scans 
can be time-consuming, especially when 
dealing with large memory spaces. 
To address this inefficiency, a user-friendly 
Python library designed to expedite the 
memory scanning process was explored 
and developed. By filtering memory regions 
based on their attributes—similar to file 
permissions—such as read, write, and 
execute permissions, the library narrows 
down the areas that need to be scanned. 
This targeted approach significantly 
reduces the time required for scanning by 
focusing only on memory regions relevant 
to the search criteria.
David Brown and Mungomba Mulenga 
discuss the exploitation of specific 
vulnerabilities in Active Directory by threat 
actors, following the compromise of Ivanti 
Secure Connect VPN appliances. Threat 
actors have been observed exploiting two 
critical vulnerabilities in Active Directory:
CVE-2021-42278: This vulnerability 
allows unauthorized modification of the 
sAMAccountName attribute of computer 
accounts, enabling attackers to impersonate 
other accounts, including domain 
administrators.
CVE-2021-42287: This flaw permits attackers 
to forge Kerberos Ticket Grant
