2024 CLOUD SECURITY REPORTBest Practices for Cloud Security Strategy

In the face of evolving threats and complexities, safeguarding your cloud environment demands 
strategic, actionable measures.

Prioritize Multi\-Layered Security: Implement a comprehensive security 
framework that integrates with your cloud services, addressing vulnerabilities at 
every level. The report’s finding that 96% of organizations are concerned about 
public cloud security underscores the need for robust, layered defenses.

Embrace Continuous Monitoring: Adopt real\-time monitoring tools 
to promptly detect and respond to threats. With 69% of organizations 
managing their cloud security through three or more solutions, integrating 
continuous monitoring can simplify and enhance security oversight.

Enhance Data Protection: To safeguard sensitive information, utilize 
encryption, access controls, and data loss prevention techniques. 55% of 
respondents identify data protection as a primary challenge in multi\-cloud 
environments, highlighting its importance.

Invest in Training and Certification: Address the skills gap and empower 
your team with the latest cloud security knowledge. 93% of respondents 
expressed concern over a shortage of qualified professionals, which can be 
mitigated through targeted education and certification programs.

Adopt a Zero Trust Model: Assume no entity is trusted by default, from 
inside or outside the network, requiring verification from anyone trying to 
access resources in your network. This approach is critical in a landscape 
where trust assumptions can lead to vulnerabilities.

Streamline with Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM): Leverage 
CSPM tools to automate the identification and remediation of risks across 
cloud platforms, reducing complexity and enhancing security posture.

Implement Identity and Access Management (IAM): With 59% highlighting
