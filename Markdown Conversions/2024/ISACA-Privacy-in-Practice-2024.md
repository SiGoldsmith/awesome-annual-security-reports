Privacy in Practice 2024 reports the results of the ISACA global State of Privacy Survey 

conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023\. This report focuses on privacy staffing, privacy 

operations, compliance, awareness training, privacy by design and breaches. While some 

survey findings are consistent with last year’s survey results, others indicate that privacy 

teams may need to manage with fewer resources in the next year.

survey report examines the state of organizational privacy.

Key Findings
This year’s survey results reveal important insights 

for enterprises:

• Demand for technical privacy roles is significantly 

more likely to increase in the next year than demand 

for legal/compliance roles.

• Perceptions of funding and board prioritization of 

privacy are comparable to those reflected in last year’s 

survey results.

Privacy professionals who optimize their 
resources and build privacy into their 
products and services can gain a competitive 
advantage and protect their consumers.

• This year’s respondents were significantly more likely 

than last year’s to believe their privacy budget would 

decrease in the next 12 months.

• Respondents identified the chief privacy officer role as 

the most likely to be accountable for privacy operations.

• Over one\-third of respondents had no plans to use 

artificial intelligence (AI) to perform privacy\-related 

tasks despite understaffing and lack of funding.

• Based on the survey responses, enterprises that 

practice privacy by design are more likely to:

• Have more interaction across all functional areas of 

the organization

• Have an organizational privacy strategy that aligns 

with other organizational objectives

• Be confident in their organization’s ability to ensure 

the privacy of its sensitive data

• Feel their privacy budget is appropriately funded

• Separate privacy training from security training

Staffing Trends

Privacy professionals largely fall into two groups: 

positions. This is consistent with anticipated budget cuts; 

legal/compliance professionals and technical privacy 

if privacy budgets are expected to decrease, it makes 

professionals. Legal/compliance professionals have 

sense that hiring will slow down.

expertise in the law and the ability to understand 

regulatory obligations. Technical privacy professionals 

have the skills and experience to evaluate and apply 

technical controls that can help achieve privacy 

objectives. In some enterprises, professionals in these 

roles work side\-by\-side on the same team, while in other 

enterprises, these roles are distinct functions that report 

to different executive leaders.

Technical privacy roles appear to be more understaffed 

than legal/compliance roles. Fifty\-four percent of survey 

respondents said technical privacy roles were somewhat 

or significantly understaffed, while 44 percent of survey 

respondents said legal/compliance roles were somewhat 

or significantly understaffed. This is consistent with 

previous years’ findings, in which technical privacy 

roles were typically more understaffed than legal and 

compliance roles. In this year’s survey, the median 

privacy staff size was nine employees, compared to 10 

last year, so it is not surprising that this understaffing 

trend is unchanged from last year’s findings. 

Open Privacy Positions
Many respondents indicated that their enterprises 

had open privacy roles. Twenty\-five percent said their 

organizations had open legal/compliance privacy roles, 

and 31 percent reported open technical privacy positions. 

This is a slight decline from last year when 27 percent of 

Figures 2 and 3 show the time required to fill privacy 

roles with a qualified candidate for legal/compliance and 

technical privacy roles, respectively. These findings are 

comparable to last year’s.

A major impediment to filling open positions is that

Figure 4 shows the top five skill deficiencies among 

privacy professionals as identified by survey respondents.

The top two deficiencies identified this year were the same 

as last year. However, the third\-largest skill deficiency 

identified this year was technical expertise. Forty\-nine 

percent of respondents identified technical expertise 

as a big skill gap, representing a 4 percent increase 

over last year. The fourth area of concern this year was 

understanding the laws and regulations applicable to an 

organization. Forty\-four percent of respondents named it 

as a significant concern—2 percent lower than last year, 

when understanding laws and regulations was the third\-

biggest skill deficiency identified. 

These results may signal a shift in hiring managers’ 

expectations for privacy professionals. Possibly they 

understand that very few candidates with technical 

expertise will also have legal expertise, and they may

did not believe the demand would increase as 

significantly as last year’s respondents did. Last year,

Privacy Operations

To be successful, privacy programs require buy\-in from the 

areas privacy professionals must work with and the 

entire enterprise. Privacy professionals need to collaborate

with nearly every department in their organization. The

tone set at the top influences the enterprise’s attitude 

and culture toward privacy. Enterprises with boards of 

directors that do not adequately prioritize privacy and that 

fail to provide it with the resources and funding it needs 

will likely experience challenges in accomplishing privacy 

objectives and meeting compliance requirements.

Collaboration
Privacy professionals must collaborate regularly with 

It is concerning that only 34 percent of respondents 

regularly worked closely with procurement; only 34 

percent worked regularly with product/business 

development; and a mere 23 percent worked regularly 

with sales, marketing and customer relations. Procuring 

technology that has strong privacy controls built in is 

crucial to protecting data subjects. The technology 

underlying an organization’s offerings must protect 

privacy, and without being involved with the procurement 

other enterprise functions. Figure 9 shows the functional 

process, it is nearly impossible for privacy professionals

Funding
Board prioritization and the organizational perception 

of privacy is important as it could affect staff buy\-in for 

privacy initiatives and resources available for privacy 

teams. Figure 13 shows respondents’ perceptions of 

privacy funding at their enterprises.

This year’s survey finding that 43 percent of respondents 

considered their organization’s privacy budgets 

underfunded is fairly consistent with last year’s, when 42 

percent held that view. However, respondents were much 

less optimistic about the future of privacy budgets this 

year compared to last year (see figure 14\).

It appears that privacy budgets have been declining 

significantly in recent years. Just two years ago, only 8 

percent of respondents believed their privacy budgets

resources may find their problems exacerbated

Artificial Intelligence
Despite challenges associated with understaffing and 

underfunding, most respondents were not leveraging 

artificial intelligence (AI) for privacy work. Figure 15 

shows a breakdown of respondents’ use of AI in privacy\-

related tasks.

Only 8 percent of respondents were using AI for privacy\-

related tasks, compared with last year when 11 percent of 

respondents said they were using AI. In last year’s survey, 

20 percent of respondents said they planned to implement 

AI for privacy tasks in the next 12 months, but based on 

this year’s survey findings, that has not happened. 

This is surprising, as 41 percent of respondents to a 

recent ISACA survey indicated that their organizations’ 

employees were using generative AI.4 It is possible 

that privacy professionals are not using AI, but their 

colleagues across the organization are—and without 

any privacy\-related considerations or oversight.

professionals reported meeting with legal/compliance 

professionals.

Privacy professionals who meet with legal/compliance 

teams only when new privacy laws and regulations 

go into effect should consider meeting on a regular 

schedule. The challenge with meeting only when new 

laws and regulations go into effect is that enforcement 

actions or data transfer\-related resources that are 

not new per se—for example, the EU\-US Data Privacy 

Framework—could significantly impact an enterprise’s 

day\-to\-day operations. Additionally, meeting regularly can 

Given the myriad privacy laws and regulations with which 

enterprises may need to comply, it is not surprising 

that some privacy professionals struggle to achieve 

compliance with new privacy laws and regulations and 

have concerns about their ability to ensure data privacy.

to achieve compliance.

allow technical privacy professionals to check in with 

legal practitioners to evaluate if the privacy controls in 

place do, in fact, meet the enterprise’s privacy obligations.

Many enterprises are aiming higher than achieving 

compliance; they are putting additional privacy controls 

in place that go beyond what is legally required. This 

might include applying controls to data not subject 

to privacy laws or regulations—for example, adopting 

GDPR requirements for all data subjects regardless 

of their location. The top five most\-used additional 

controls reported by survey respondents are:

• Identity and access management (74 percent)

• Encryption (73 percent)

• Number of privacy incidents: 56 percent

• Number of privacy complaints received from

Enterprises should be wary of relying solely on the number 

of privacy incidents and/or complaints to measure the 

quality of privacy training. These measures are reactive; 

they indicate that an incident has occurred or a customer 

has experienced a privacy harm. The damage has been 

done, and revising privacy training after the fact likely will 

not restore consumer trust. While tracking the number 

of employees who have completed privacy awareness 

training can be valuable, it does not provide any insight 

into whether employees have learned anything, if they 

found the training useful, or if they became more capable 

of acting in ways that align with privacy objectives. Pre\- 

and post\-training assessments—even just a few true/

false questions asked before and after the training—may 

provide better insights on the quality of privacy training.

training; 29 percent did not separate them; and 6

The large percentage of respondents who did not 

know if their enterprises experienced a privacy breach 

signals a broader issue about breach response and 

data classification. Some organizations may know 

they experienced a breach but not know if personal 

information was compromised, which may mean data 

classification efforts need improvement.

FIGURE 22: Comparing Breach Trends

There was no consensus among respondents on the 

likelihood of experiencing a material privacy breach in 

the next year, as shown in figure 23\. It is concerning that 

almost a quarter of respondents did not know the likelihood 

of experiencing a privacy breach. This may indicate that 

privacy risk is an area of growth for many enterprises, and 

it could also indicate that privacy professionals need a 

better definition of what constitutes a privacy breach.
