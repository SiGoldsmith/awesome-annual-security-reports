Privacy in Practice 2024 reports the results of the ISACA global State of Privacy Survey 
conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023. This report focuses on privacy staffing, privacy 
operations, compliance, awareness training, privacy by design and breaches. While some 
survey findings are consistent with last year’s survey results, others indicate that privacy 
teams may need to manage with fewer resources in the next year.

## Executive Summary
Privacy in Practice 2024 explores privacy staffing, 
operations, compliance efforts, awareness training, 
breaches and privacy by design based on the results of 
the fourth annual ISACA global State of Privacy Survey 
conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Respecting data subjects and protecting their privacy 
is a key component of digital trust. Additionally, failure 
to comply with privacy laws and regulations could 
result in significant fines and reputational harm. Privacy 
professionals who optimize their resources and build 
privacy into their products and services can gain a 
competitive advantage and protect their consumers. This 
survey report examines the state of organizational privacy.

### Key Findings
This year’s survey results reveal important insights  
for enterprises:
- Demand for technical privacy roles is significantly 
more likely to increase in the next year than demand 
for legal/compliance roles.
- Perceptions of funding and board prioritization of 
privacy are comparable to those reflected in last year’s 
survey results.
- Expert-level privacy professionals are the most difficult 
to hire, consistent with last year’s findings.
- The most common obstacles to creating privacy 
programs are a lack of competent resources; a 
lack of clarity on the program’s mandate, roles and 
responsibilities; a lack of executive or business 
support; and a lack of visibility and influence within  
the enterprise.
- The most common privacy failure is poor or 
nonexistent training.
- This year’s respondents were significantly more likely 
than last year’s to believe their privacy budget would 
decrease in the next 12 months.
- Respondents identified the chief privacy officer role as 
the most likely to be accountable for privacy operations.
- Over one-third of respondents had no plans to use 
artificial intelligence (AI) to perform privacy-related 
tasks despite understaffing and lack of funding.
- Based on the survey responses, enterprises that 
practice privacy by design are more likely to:
  - Have more interaction across all functional areas of 
the organization
  - Have an organizational privacy strategy that aligns 
with other organizational objectives
  - Be confident in their organization’s ability to ensure 
the privacy of its sensitive data
  - Feel their privacy budget is appropriately funded
  - Separate privacy training from security training

### Survey Methodology
In the fourth quarter of 2023, ISACA sent survey 
invitations to approximately 15,500 ISACA constituents 
who held the Certified Data Privacy Solutions Engineer™ 
(CDPSE™) designation or had “privacy” in their job title. 
Invitations were also sent to those who held the ISACA 
CSX Cybersecurity Practitioner Certification™ (CSX-P™) 
or Certified Information Security Manager® (CISM®) 
designation. More than 1,300 people completed the survey.
>Privacy professionals who optimize their 
resources and build privacy into their 
products and services can gain a competitive 
advantage and protect their consumers.

Some respondents held multiple additional ISACA 
certifications. Thirty-nine percent of respondents were in 
management roles, 28 percent were in senior leadership 
roles, 20 percent were individual contributors, and the 
remaining 13 percent were in executive leadership 
positions. Figure 1 shows additional demographic 
information about survey respondents.

## Staffing Trends
Privacy professionals largely fall into two groups: 
legal/compliance professionals and technical privacy 
professionals. Legal/compliance professionals have 
expertise in the law and the ability to understand 
regulatory obligations. Technical privacy professionals 
have the skills and experience to evaluate and apply 
technical controls that can help achieve privacy 
objectives. In some enterprises, professionals in these 
roles work side-by-side on the same team, while in other 
enterprises, these roles are distinct functions that report 
to different executive leaders.
Technical privacy roles appear to be more understaffed 
than legal/compliance roles. Fifty-four percent of survey 
respondents said technical privacy roles were somewhat 
or significantly understaffed, while 44 percent of survey 
respondents said legal/compliance roles were somewhat 
or significantly understaffed. This is consistent with 
previous years’ findings, in which technical privacy 
roles were typically more understaffed than legal and 
compliance roles. In this year’s survey, the median 
privacy staff size was nine employees, compared to 10 
last year, so it is not surprising that this understaffing 
trend is unchanged from last year’s findings. 

### Open Privacy Positions
Many respondents indicated that their enterprises 
had open privacy roles. Twenty-five percent said their 
organizations had open legal/compliance privacy roles, 
and 31 percent reported open technical privacy positions. 
This is a slight decline from last year when 27 percent of 
respondents’ organizations had open legal/compliance 
positions and 34 percent had open technical privacy 
positions. This is consistent with anticipated budget cuts; 
if privacy budgets are expected to decrease, it makes 
sense that hiring will slow down.
Figures 2 and 3 show the time required to fill privacy 
roles with a qualified candidate for legal/compliance and 
technical privacy roles, respectively. These findings are 
comparable to last year’s.
Eighteen percent of respondents said the time required to 
fill legal/compliance roles had somewhat or significantly

increased, which is identical to last year’s findings. 
Nineteen percent of respondents said the time required 
to fill open technical privacy positions had increased. This 
represents a decline from last year when 23 percent of 
respondents said the time to fill open technical positions 
had somewhat or significantly increased.

### Qualifications
A major impediment to filling open positions is that 
many applicants are not considered well qualified. Only 
21 percent of respondents indicated that more than half 
the applicants to legal/compliance roles and technical 
privacy roles in their enterprises were well qualified for 
position for which they are applying, compared to 24 
percent for legal/compliance applicants and 25 percent 
for technical privacy applicants last year. 
Figure 4 shows the top five skill deficiencies among 
privacy professionals as identified by survey respondents.
The top two deficiencies identified this year were the same 
as last year. However, the third-largest skill deficiency 
identified this year was technical expertise. Forty-nine 
percent of respondents identified technical expertise 
as a big skill gap, representing a 4 percent increase 
over last year. The fourth area of concern this year was 
understanding the laws and regulations applicable to an 
organization. Forty-four percent of respondents named it 
as a significant concern—2 percent lower than last year, 
when understanding laws and regulations was the third-
biggest skill deficiency identified. 
These results may signal a shift in hiring managers’ 
expectations for privacy professionals. Possibly they 
understand that very few candidates with technical 
expertise will also have legal expertise, and they may

no longer be striving to hire a single person who can do 
everything. It is also possible that the rapidly evolving 
technology landscape has made technical expertise a 
more valuable candidate trait.
Figure 5 shows the importance of a variety of factors 
in determining a job applicant’s qualifications and 
compares this year’s findings to last year’s. The figure 
shows the percentage of respondents who considered 
the factor in question to be very or somewhat 
important. Though survey respondents indicated 
that previous privacy experience was desirable in 
a candidate, the reality is that many practitioners 
pivoted to their careers in privacy. Forty-four percent 
of respondents said that more than half of their 
enterprise’s privacy staff started their careers in a 
completely different field and transitioned to privacy 
roles. In fact, only 18 percent of respondents indicated 
that more than half of their enterprise’s privacy staff 
began their careers in privacy.
These findings are consistent with the findings shown in 
figure 6, which illustrate the strategies enterprises use to 
address the privacy skills gap.

### Demand for Privacy Professionals
Expert privacy professionals are the most challenging 
category to hire as evidenced by 76 percent of 
respondents, followed by practitioners (48 percent)  
and entry level/foundational privacy professionals  
(14 percent).
The demand for privacy professionals across all 
expertise levels is expected to increase over the next 
year. Figures 7 and 8 show the anticipated demand for 
legal/compliance and technical privacy professionals 
over the next year, respectively. This year’s respondents 
did not believe the demand would increase as 
significantly as last year’s respondents did. Last year, 
62 percent of respondents said they anticipated the 
demand for legal/compliance roles would increase, and 
69 percent of respondents said the demand for technical 
privacy professionals would increase in the next year. 
The increasing demand coupled with staff retention 
challenges could exacerbate understaffing issues in  
the future. Forty-one percent of respondents said  
they experienced difficulty in retaining qualified  
privacy professionals.

## Privacy Operations
To be successful, privacy programs require buy-in from the 
entire enterprise. Privacy professionals need to collaborate 
with nearly every department in their organization. The 
tone set at the top influences the enterprise’s attitude 
and culture toward privacy. Enterprises with boards of 
directors that do not adequately prioritize privacy and that 
fail to provide it with the resources and funding it needs 
will likely experience challenges in accomplishing privacy 
objectives and meeting compliance requirements.

### Collaboration
Privacy professionals must collaborate regularly with 
other enterprise functions. Figure 9 shows the functional 
areas privacy professionals must work with and the 
percentages of respondents who said they always or 
frequently collaborated with these departments. 
It is concerning that only 34 percent of respondents 
regularly worked closely with procurement; only 34 
percent worked regularly with product/business 
development; and a mere 23 percent worked regularly 
with sales, marketing and customer relations. Procuring 
technology that has strong privacy controls built in is 
crucial to protecting data subjects. The technology 
underlying an organization’s offerings must protect 
privacy, and without being involved with the procurement 
process, it is nearly impossible for privacy professionals

to practice privacy by design. Product development 
may leverage deceptive privacy practices, but privacy 
professionals who work closely with them can guide 
them away from products that do not align with privacy 
objectives. Marketing teams often rely heavily on data to 
inform marketing efforts, and privacy professionals can 
also guide marketing teams away from deceptive privacy 
practices and excessive consumer tracking.

### Accountability for Privacy
Depending on how an organization is structured and 
taking into account the competencies of the C-suite, 
privacy professionals may report to different leaders. 
Figure 10 shows who is primarily accountable for privacy. 
These results are consistent with the 2023 survey findings. 
Enterprise size may affect who is ultimately accountable 
for privacy. Twenty-seven percent of respondents who 
worked at enterprises with fewer than 250 employees 
said the chief executive officer (CEO) was accountable 
for privacy, but only 8 percent of respondents at 
organizations with more than 25,000 employees said 
the CEO was primarily responsible. Thirty-two percent 
of respondents at enterprises with 25,000+ employees 
said the chief privacy officer was primarily accountable 
for privacy at their organization, but only 10 percent 
of respondents at enterprises with fewer than 250 
employees said a CPO was primarily responsible. 
Compared to a chief privacy officer, a CEO is likely less 
aware of what privacy entails and why it is important, and 
privacy professionals who report to the CEO could face 
a bigger challenge in obtaining executive-level buy-in for 
privacy initiatives.
Privacy professionals should be aware of potential 
conflicts of interest depending on where the privacy 
function resides within an organization. Security may be 
at odds with privacy at times. For example, the security 
concept of nonrepudiation (that is, the assurance that 
a party cannot later deny originating data and provision 
of proof of the integrity and origin of the data that can 
be verified by a third party) could be at odds with an 
individual’s right to communicate privately—for example, 
with an anonymous ethics hotline. Additionally, reporting 
to legal could represent a conflict of interest because 
privacy focuses on the rights of individuals while legal 
departments focus primarily on protecting the enterprise.

### Boards of Directors and Privacy
The board of directors can have a significant impact 
on an enterprise’s privacy program. Fifty-seven percent 
of respondents said their boards adequately prioritized 
privacy. This is a slight increase compared with last 
year when 55 percent of respondents said their boards 
adequately prioritized privacy. Figure 11 shows board 
prioritization of privacy.
Boards may prioritize privacy programs in a few ways. 
A compliance-driven approach considers privacy a 
regulatory requirement. An ethical approach prioritizes 
privacy regardless of applicable laws and regulations. 
Some enterprises may view privacy protection as a 
competitive advantage, and many enterprises will 
combine approaches to privacy prioritization. Figure 12 
shows how boards view privacy programs.
Last year, only 33 percent of respondents said their 
boards viewed privacy as being compliance-driven, while 
this year that number rose to 44 percent. It is possible 
that recent enforcement actions and new privacy laws 
and regulations have made compliance a higher priority 
for enterprises. The compliance-driven perception was 
slightly higher among Europe-based respondents, with 49 
percent reporting their boards viewed privacy programs 
as compliance-driven. This result is unsurprising, 
considering the far-reaching impacts of the European 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Seventy-four percent of respondents said their 
organization’s privacy strategy was aligned with 
organizational objectives, 11 percent said it was not 
and 15 percent did not know. This represents a slight 
increase from last year, when 73 percent of respondents 
said their organization’s privacy strategy was aligned with 
organizational objectives.

### Funding
Board prioritization and the organizational perception 
of privacy is important as it could affect staff buy-in for 
privacy initiatives and resources available for privacy 
teams. Figure 13 shows respondents’ perceptions of 
privacy funding at their enterprises.
This year’s survey finding that 43 percent of respondents 
considered their organization’s privacy budgets 
underfunded is fairly consistent with last year’s, when 42 
percent held that view. However, respondents were much 
less optimistic about the future of privacy budgets this 
year compared to last year (see figure 14).
It appears that privacy budgets have been declining 
significantly in recent years. Just two years ago, only 8 
percent of respondents believed their privacy budgets 
would decline in the next 12 months. It is surprising 
that in the midst of a rapidly evolving regulatory 
landscape, privacy professionals this year still

believed their budgets for the next year would shrink. 
This is especially concerning because 63 percent of 
respondents who believed their privacy budgets were 
already underfunded anticipated that funding would 
decrease in the next 12 months. This suggests that 
some teams that are already struggling with limited 
resources may find their problems exacerbated  
next year. 
Perhaps allaying some fears about budget cuts, only 5 
percent of respondents expected a significant decrease 
compared to 46 percent who said their privacy budgets 
would somewhat decrease. Budget cuts may not be 
drastic, but privacy professionals should be prepared for 
some cuts. This aligns with global economic trends; global 
growth in 2024 is forecast to be lower than in 2023.[^1]  
But privacy may be disproportionately affected by the 
economic downturn: Only 11 percent of respondents to 
ISACA’s State of Cybersecurity 2023 survey anticipated 
a decrease in their cybersecurity budget.[^2] This 
could be because high-profile breaches, such as the 
LastPass breach,[^3] and concerns about ransomware 
have motivated enterprises to not cut cybersecurity 
spending. More concerning is the possibility that 
enterprises believe cybersecurity and privacy are 
interchangeable and that cybersecurity professionals 
are tasked with privacy and vice versa.

### Artificial Intelligence
Despite challenges associated with understaffing and 
underfunding, most respondents were not leveraging 
artificial intelligence (AI) for privacy work. Figure 15 
shows a breakdown of respondents’ use of AI in privacy-
related tasks.
Only 8 percent of respondents were using AI for privacy-
related tasks, compared with last year when 11 percent of 
respondents said they were using AI. In last year’s survey, 
20 percent of respondents said they planned to implement 
AI for privacy tasks in the next 12 months, but based on 
this year’s survey findings, that has not happened. 
This is surprising, as 41 percent of respondents to a 
recent ISACA survey indicated that their organizations’ 
employees were using generative AI.[^4] It is possible 
that privacy professionals are not using AI, but their 
colleagues across the organization are—and without 
any privacy-related considerations or oversight.

PRIVACY IN PRACTICE 2024

The reluctance to adopt AI might be a positive sign: Survey 
respondents might understand that AI is not a panacea 
for privacy challenges. Enterprises in organizations with 
lower revenues and smaller staff sizes were considerably 
less likely to use AI. Forty-eight percent of respondents 
in enterprises with less than US$50 million in revenue 
said they had no plans to use AI for privacy-related tasks, 
compared to just 24 percent of those in enterprises with 
more than US$1 billion in revenue. Forty-nine percent of 
respondents in enterprises with fewer than 250 employees 
said they had no plans to use AI for privacy-related tasks, 
compared to just 23 percent of those in organizations with 
more than 25,000 people. These findings suggest that 
small enterprises understand that leveraging AI requires 
governance and resources to effectively manage it, and 
employing AI for privacy-related tasks might stretch an 
already overtaxed staff.
Privacy professionals largely seem to understand that 
AI could carry privacy-related risk. For example, if an 
AI platform uses inputs to train future outputs, inputs 
of personal information could shape future outcomes, 
which might result in privacy violations. Forty-five  
percent of respondents who were not at all confident 
in their enterprise’s data privacy abilities said they had 
no plans to use AI for privacy-related functions, and 
53 percent of respondents who were not so confident 
in their data privacy abilities said they had no plans 
to use AI for privacy tasks. This suggests that privacy 
professionals understand the risk associated with AI 
and that until their privacy program matures, the risk 
associated with using AI for privacy tasks outweighs  
the benefits.

## Compliance
To date, more than 160 privacy laws have been enacted 
internationally.[^5] Because of the numerous privacy laws and 
regulations in effect, privacy teams are often scrambling 
to keep up with their compliance-related obligations. Using 
a framework or legal foundation to manage privacy can 
provide enterprises with clear objectives. Seventy-eight 
percent of survey respondents said they used a framework 
or law/regulation to manage privacy in their organizations. 
Figure 16 shows the five frameworks and regulations 
most commonly used to manage privacy.
There are some regional differences as to which 
frameworks or regulations are used to manage privacy. 
For example, 78 percent of respondents in Europe used the 
GDPR, and 61 percent of respondents in North America 
used the NIST Privacy Framework to manage privacy.
