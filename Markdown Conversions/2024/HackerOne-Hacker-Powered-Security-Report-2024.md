## Executive Summary
Cyberthreats are always evolving. So must your defenses. Faster, smarter, and always ahead.

Every organization is a technology organization. Car manufacturers, government agencies, and banks do very different things, but they all conduct business digitally. With AI deployments—as well as AI-powered threat actors—now mainstream, the digital threat landscape is growing and changing faster than ever.

Just a few years ago, organizations only had to worry about one OWASP Top 10 list. Now there are OWASP Top 10 lists for mobile security, LLMs and more. What's next? And how do you stay ahead of it all?

We've been watching these trends and reporting on them for over eight years now in the Hacker-Powered Security Report. Read on to learn about the impact of AI on security research, what the researchers themselves are thinking and seeing, industry trends, and more. We report on the top vulnerability types, and how the most resilient companies have adopted a defense-in-depth strategy, fortifying every layer of their security posture and using continuous vulnerability testing throughout the software development life cycle.

Human-powered, AI-enabled security testing remains vital in identifying vulnerabilities that automated scanners often miss, as the creativity and expertise of skilled researchers are unmatched by machines.

Since the first Hacker-Powered Security Report in 2017, the security researcher community has consistently been proven to keep pace with technological changes, deliver ongoing value, and gain the trust of even the most risk-averse organizations. Over the past decade, we’ve seen significant progress for trust in good-faith research, including updated safe harbor guidelines from the Department of Justice, legislation requiring organizations to implement vulnerability reporting processes, and increasing adoption of vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs by leading enterprises. In fact, these programs are now cited in S1 filings as evidence of an organization's commitment to security.

This 8th Annual Hacker-Powered Security Report compiles insights, data, and analysis from customers, security researchers, and HackerOne’s comprehensive vulnerability database. The insights are gathered from:

*   Aggregated, anonymized data from the HackerOne Platform, made up of over 500,000 valid vulnerability reports.
*   A survey, conducted in partnership with Opinion Matters, of 500 security leaders globally about their approach to cybersecurity challenges.
*   Our annual survey of 2,000+ highly skilled and active members of the security researcher community, covering topics ranging from the time they dedicate to hacking to their views on AI regulations. The respondents reflect the diversity of location, experience, expertise, and age that defines HackerOne’s global community of security researchers.
*   Our annual survey of 50 customers, representing a range of organizational sizes, structures, and industries.

Researchers and security professionals alike see AI as both a risk and an opportunity. 48% of security leaders said that generative AI (GenAI) was one of the most significant risks they saw impacting their organization, with data integrity being a key priority to secure.

The security researcher community is maturing its skill sets to meet the demands of customers, with more members focusing on mobile, APIs, and AI deployments as testing scope expands to more varied attack surfaces. Nearly 10% of researchers now specialize in AI to meet the growing demand of AI testing engagements.

The top vulnerability reported to a bug bounty program is cross-site scripting (XSS), whereas for a pentest it’s misconfiguration. Pentests tend to uncover more systemic or architectural vulnerabilities while security researchers working on bug bounty programs focus more on real-world attack vectors, user-level issues, and business logic flaws.

The most security-resilient organizations have refined their engagement with the researcher community to achieve the ideal formula for impactful results, focusing on a broad scope and a select team of trusted researchers. High-impact programs—those with over 30% of valid vulnerability submissions rated as high or critical—work with fewer researchers; the average number of researchers on a high-impact program is 56, vs. 97 on lower-impact programs.

The most technologically advanced industries are seeing results when it comes to the efforts to reduce common vulnerabilities in production, with Web3 companies seeing 65% fewer reports for cross-site scripting than the industry average.

## The Impact of AI on Security Research and Vulnerability Management
Last year we introduced a dedicated AI section in the Hacker-Powered Security Report, recognizing the growing influence of GenAI on how organizations operate and plan ahead. This year we’re digging deeper into both security for AI (how organizations manage risks in AI deployments) and AI for security (how researchers and organizations use AI to improve vulnerability management). We also highlight the crucial role human expertise plays in keeping AI innovation trustworthy and secure for everyone.

>“The downside of AI is that it introduces more vulnerabilities. If a company uses it, we’ll find bugs in it. AI is even hacking other AI models. It’s going so fast and security is struggling to catch up.”

We surveyed 500 security professionals to understand their experiences and opinions around AI adoption within their industries and organizations. Nearly half (48%) cited GenAI as one of the most significant risks facing their organizations. The top concerns included training-data leaks (35%), unauthorized AI usage within their organizations (33%), and the hacking of AI models by external parties (32%).

### Security for AI
*Image Description: A bar chart showing the percentage of security professionals concerned about various IT-related risks. The risks listed are: Generative AI (48%), Cloud Security (40%), Supply Chain Security (38%), Ransomware (37%), and other (13%).*

64% of respondents believe GenAI will have a major impact on their organization, with 62% confident in their ability to secure its use. Additionally, 70% believe that AI legislation will help enhance safety and security. However, 51% are concerned about the reputational risks tied to AI, and another 51% highlight that basic security practices are being overlooked in the rush to implement GenAI.

When we asked the same questions to a group of HackerOne customers, we found similar views on the impact of GenAI—64% agreed it would significantly affect their operations. However, only 38% felt confident in their ability to defend against AI-related threats, and just 39% believed that legislation would make AI safer.

As highly knowledgeable and technologically advanced organizations, HackerOne’s customers have a deep understanding of the challenges involved in securing this rapidly evolving technology. Interestingly, they were less concerned about the reputational risks of AI than non-customers were, with 48% of customers expressing worry.

>“It’s been previously observed in research from red teaming exercises of AI models that some individuals are significantly more effective at breaking the models’ defenses than others. I was surprised that many of the researchers did not know much about AI but were able to use creativity and persistence to get around our safety filters.”

HackerOne customers are taking proactive steps to avoid AI-related security incidents. The number of AI assets included in HackerOne programs has surged by 171% over the past year and will soon surpass 1,000 assets.

AI red teaming—where organizations invite security researchers to identify safety and security flaws in their AI products—is gaining traction as a best practice for testing GenAI deployments. In fact, 67% of security leaders and HackerOne customers believe that an external, unbiased review of GenAI implementations is the most effective way to uncover AI safety and security issues.

Concerns about AI safety are driving more organizations to seek third-party testing. Of all AI vulnerability reports submitted, 55% are related to AI safety issues. AI safety issues often have a lower barrier to entry for valid reporting and present a different risk profile compared to traditional security vulnerabilities. The reduced barriers to entry for AI safety reports means bounties for these reports are slightly lower, with an average payout of $401, versus $689 for AI security programs. While AI safety vulnerabilities are currently in scope for a limited number of programs, the volume of reports is notably higher, making AI safety one of the top five reported vulnerabilities.

### Recommendations
*   Establish continuous testing, evaluation, verification, and validation throughout the AI model life cycle.
*   Provide regular executive metrics and updates on AI model functionality, security, reliability, and robustness. Regularly scan and update the underlying infrastructure and software for vulnerabilities.
*   Determine country-, state-, or government-specific AI compliance requirements. Some regulations exist around specific AI features, such as facial recognition and employment-related systems. Establish an AI governance framework outlining roles, responsibilities, and ethical considerations, including incident response planning and risk management.
*   Train all users on ethics, responsibility, legal issues, AI security risks, and best practices such as warranty, license, and copyright. Establish a culture of open and transparent communication on the organization’s use of predictive or generative AI.

## Security Researchers Expand Their Expertise Into AI, APIs, and More
More of the security researcher community is choosing the flexibility of a full-time career as security researchers are dedicating more hours to developing their skills. 30% now hack full-time, up from 24% in 2023, and 44% spend over 20 hours a week hacking, compared to 35% the previous year.

While 77% of researchers cite earning money as a key motivator, 64% view hacking as a valuable way to learn and develop their skills, and 48% do it to advance their careers. Additionally, 34% are driven by a strong desire to protect businesses and end users, highlighting the community's commitment to making a positive impact.

*Image Description: A pie chart showing the motivations of security researchers. The motivations listed are: Earning Money (77%), Learning and Developing Skills (64%), Advancing Career (48%), Protecting Businesses and End Users (34%), and other (11%).*

When HackerOne first launched, most hacking activity focused on web applications, and while 88% of researchers still specialize in this area, the landscape is shifting. Organizations are now calling on the community to test a wider range of products and technologies. 56% of researchers also specialize in APIs, while almost 10% now focus on AI and large language models (LLMs). Although the number of AI-focused researchers has grown by just 2% since last year, it's promising that nearly 10% are already working to secure this emerging technology. As more organizations include AI models in their scope, we expect this number to keep growing.

*Image Description: A bar chart showing the percentage of security researchers who focus on various asset types in bug bounty programs. The asset types listed are: Web Applications (88%), APIs (56%), Mobile Applications (44%), Cloud Infrastructure (34%), AI and LLMs (10%), and other (14%).*

Security researchers excel in reconnaissance and manual exploitation—two key hacking skills that automated scanners can't match. These tasks require human creativity, like uncovering an unsecured, overlooked domain or spotting a unique vulnerability from an outsider’s view. Even more advanced is exploit chaining, where vulnerabilities are combined into a larger, more impactful exploit. While chaining might be more challenging for individuals, researchers often collaborate, blending their strengths to create powerful, high-impact exploits.

Data indicates many researchers feel less confident in writing detailed reports, but GenAI tools are bridging this gap, enabling clearer communication of findings and higher-quality reports.

*Image Description: A pie chart showing the skills security researchers consider themselves most skilled at. The skills listed are: Reconnaissance (26%), Manual Exploitation (24%), Report Writing (19%), Exploit Chaining (16%), and other (15%).*

### Recommendations
*   Clearly communicate expected response times for report acknowledgment, triage, and resolution. This builds trust and helps researchers understand when they can expect feedback.
*   Offer constructive feedback on the report, explaining the vulnerability’s impact and any necessary remediation steps.
*   Respond to researchers with respect and professionalism, even if the report is invalid or a duplicate. Positive interactions encourage ongoing collaboration.

The more you and your organization know and understand about researchers and their skills, motivation, and approaches, the stronger the relationship will be and the more impactful your program will be.

>Jasmin Landry, @jr0ch17
>Security Researcher and HackerOne Pentester

Beyond the financial aspect, researchers value strong relationships with security teams, transparent communication, and quick responses to bounties and report resolutions. Clear updates on report status build trust, and offering context when a report's criticality is downgraded helps foster collaboration. Additionally, 41% mentioned that negative peer reviews would discourage them from participating, underscoring how important perception is for attracting researchers, driving engagement, and scaling a program effectively.

### Perspectives From the Hacker Advisory Board
> "Gather feedback from hackers to improve your program. Ask what they'd like to see, such as adding assets to scope—something I’ve requested in the past, which led to discovering additional vulnerabilities. Lower barriers to entry; extra policies or special requirements may discourage researchers from participating."

Most security researchers are attracted to a wide range of assets in scope, and only a few shy away from targets seen as tough to crack. With the right incentives, they’re more than ready to take on the challenge.

*   Higher bounties: Offering average payouts of $3,300 at the 95th percentile, compared to $2,000 for lower-impact programs.
*   Smaller, focused communities: Engaging fewer researchers, with an average of 56 versus 97 in lower-impact programs. However, being able to curate a smaller, highly engaged group depends on having a large researcher pool from which to choose the most applicable talent for your program.
*   Broader testing scope: Providing more assets for testing, averaging 60 assets compared to 34 in lower-impact programs.

### Recommendations
*   Collaborate with a select group of skilled researchers who align well to your program’s scope.
*   Establish reward structures aligned with the criticality of the assets being tested, ideally offering compensation above market standards.
*   Ensure your testing scope is broad and varied, allowing researchers with diverse skill sets to contribute meaningfully. This targeted approach fosters deeper engagement and drives more impactful security outcomes.

>“I believe in a blanket approach when it comes to which assets to test with bug bounty. Test everything across the board. People say, ‘We don’t want to put everything out there,’ but, if one asset is compromised, then the next is too. If it’s external facing, it should be tested.”
