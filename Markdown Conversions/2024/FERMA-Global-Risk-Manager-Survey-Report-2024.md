Survey Report
2024

We are delighted to present the results of the 2024 Global Risk Manager Survey.
The survey has taken place every other year since 2001-2002 and represents a comprehensive picture of the views 
of Risk Managers from across Europe. This year, for the first time, the survey was expanded to include responses 
from members of risk management associations across the world, as well as the PwC global network. We would 
like to thank our partners (ALARYS, Club Franco Risk, IRMSA, PARIMA, RIMS, and RMIA) for their valuable 
contributions to making this a global study and enabling us to gather a range of views from across 77 countries.  
Today’s risk landscape is characterised by a need to adapt to immediate short-term challenges at the same time as 
integrating longer term concerns, such as climate change adaptation and the green transition, into enterprise risk 
management (ERM) frameworks.
The survey highlights the fact that Risk Managers have extended their influence across the organisation and are 
playing a pivotal role in ERM training as well as in promoting and strengthening a risk culture.
We are seeing a growing integration between Risk Managers and Sustainability functions. Risk Managers 
are increasingly involved and influential in the Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) activities of their 
organisations, which are a key area of investment for most. 
The quantification of risk remains a challenge, but is a clear focus for Risk Managers, many of whom are using new 
technologies to support them in this area.  
When we consider the strategic insurance priorities of Risk and Insurance Managers, we see a clear focus on long-
term stability. Risk and Insurance Managers signalled that they increasingly wish to negotiate long-term insurance 
contracts and make more use of self-insurance vehicles like captives, to move away from the short-term nature 
of yearly policy renewals and take into account the looming possibility of certain business activities or locations 
becoming uninsurable in the future. 
In the current climate of polycrisis and interconnected risk, the role of the Risk Manager is becoming more strategic 
than ever. And this continues to evolve against a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty, climate crisis and a digital 
economy, among other emerging risks. 
This international survey shows that the Risk Manager is stepping up to the challenge, helping to build resilient 
organisations that not only mitigate these risks but take advantage of the opportunities of this dynamic environment.

Talent management and data breach have emerged in the Top 5 short-term risks 
The three other risks remain in the Top 5 of short-term concerns, however,  
cyber-attacks and uncertain economic growth have disappeared from the  
Top 3 medium-term threats. 
At a three-year horizon, a complete shift was seen, with the entry of two risks 
previously viewed as short-term: geopolitical uncertainties and regulation. 
This year marks a significant pivot in long-term risk priorities with only 
environmental concerns cited within the top long-term risks.
Geopolitical uncertainties dominate short- and medium-term concerns, with climate 
and environmental threats topping the concerns in the long term. 
The geopolitical landscape has become more unpredictable, with ongoing conflicts like the 
Ukraine-Russia tensions and the Israel-Palestine situation adding layers of complexity and 
uncertainty. 
At the same time, the worsening of climatic conditions, evidenced by the rising frequency and 
intensity of extreme weather events, presents significant challenges. This shift demands 
robust project and risk management and strategic planning to mitigate associated risks.
These evolving risks require Risk Managers to expand their roles, becoming strategic partners 
within their organisations. This involves developing more nuanced approaches to risk 
assessment and mitigation that are attuned to changing geopolitical, environmental, and 
demographic dynamics

Key findings
Expanding involvement of the Risk Manager throughout the organisation
The survey illustrated a greater contribution of Risk Managers to: 
- 	Risk mapping: large involvement in global and strategic risk map; little involvement in 
legal and carbon neutrality risk maps; and moderate involvement for ESG, anti-corruption, 
cyber, security and supply-chain risk maps.
- 	Strategic committees: half of Risk Managers are invited to Board and Executive 
Committees; more than half chair or are members of a Risk Committee. 
- Collaboration with the lines of defence, specifically with ESG.

Top 3 trends that impacted the insurance market: 
Consequently, 42% of Insurance Managers observe a reduction in natural catastrophe coverage, 
the most affected policy of those asked about in this study. 
In this context, Insurance Managers adapted their insurance strategy by:
- Changing their insurance buying pattern (54%): reviewing needs, limits and sub-limits
- Strengthening loss prevention activity (44%)
- Negotiating long-term agreements (30%)
- Setting up or marking further use of captive facilities (28%)
Risk retention remains the primary strategy (62%), closely followed by the use of an existing captive 
for 35% of Insurance Managers, with another 17% of them inclined to create a captive insurance / 
re-insurance vehicle.
Parametric insurance enters the top strategies used by respondents in this year’s study, and is cited 
by 19% of the respondents.
A stable proportion of respondents report that they have been using a captive or similar 
vehicle since the study in 2020. However, this year, a further 10% of respondents said they  
are considering implementing this risk transfer solution.

FERMA Global Risk Manager Survey Report - 2024  |  15
The data in this report were collected from an anonymous web-based survey distributed through 
FERMA’s member associations and other continents’ associations, as well as the PwC global network 
between January and April 2024. 
Until now a European survey, this year the study was extended globally, and responses were gathered 
from 1041 respondents in 77 countries around the world:

Although the analysis of the results is conducted on a global scale and ensures a comprehensive understanding 
of the overall trends and insights, responses remain largely from Europe (79%). The dominance of European 
responses is acknowledged, and the low number of respondents in Africa, South America, Asia, and Oceania 
limits the ability to draw conclusions based on geography. 
Responses were aggregated into the eight clusters below that are representative in terms of number of 
respondents and geography.

Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam (1)
- 	Oceania (22): Australia (18) and New Zealand (4)
The survey included 56 questions divided into seven categories:
- 	Your profile (5 questions)
- 	Your organisation (9 questions)
- 	Risk Management within the organisation (19 questions)
- 	Insurance management (6 questions)
- 	Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) (9 questions)
- 	Technology risk management (4 questions)
- 	Digitalisation of the ERM function (4 questions)
Some questions are triggered by the answers to others. Therefore, the number of respondents may vary 
from one question to another. Additionally, some questions were not mandatory so the number of 
respondents per question differs.
Specific survey questions targeted each profile (ERM and IM), providing insights into their respective risk 
management activities. 
The report comprises: a detailed description of the survey respondents; a summary of how Risk Managers 
saw risks in 2024 in an uncertain political and economic context; and the analysis of answers to the sets of 
questions listed above. 
To accompany the report, we have produced 12 files summarising the data per country, continent, 
or group of countries. The repartition of countries within these files is as below:
- 	One file per continent except Europe: North America, South America, Africa, Oceania, Asia

## Profile of survey respondents
The gender distribution among Risk Managers 
has seen minimal change over the years, with the 
proportion of women increasing slightly to 36% 
from 32%.
This gender breakdown remains consistent across 
different sectors, with women being most represented 
in the industry sector at 39% and least in financial 
services at 33%.
There is a gradual increase in the number of women in the profession, notably in the age range 
of between 31 and 35 years old, and this continues to be seen in the age range of those less than 
30 years old.
For the age group between 31 and 35 years, there has been a shift in the last two years: in 2022, 23% 
were women, whereas in 2024, 37% are women, marking a 14 percentage points increase. This reflects 
a stark generational difference in gender distribution, with a trend towards greater gender balance 
among younger age groups.

Participants from Africa and Asia tend to be younger overall: 22% of African respondents 
are under 36 years of age, while 27% from Asia fall into this age bracket.  
Asia is showcasing a balanced representation across age groups. Most respondents 
- 41% - fall between the ages of 46 and 55, with 27% falling between 36 and 45 years old 
and a further 27% between 31 and 35 years old. 
The profession remains characterised by experienced individuals 
and has difficulty in attracting young talent
FERMA Global Risk Manager Survey Report - 2024  |  19
More than half (53%) of respondents possess more than 10 years of experience, and 17% report having 
between four and six years of experience, mirroring another 17% who indicated having between 7 and  
10 years of experience. This ranking is constant no matter whether in Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), 
or in Insurance Management (IM), or in both.
In terms of total annual remuneration, the distribution among respondents globally reflects a varied 
landscape, with remuneration levels remaining relatively steady compared with 2022.
Gender disparity is particularly pronounced in higher salary brackets, which is consistent with women 
being more represented in the under 35 age bracket and less experienced profiles. The notable difference 
between gender lies in the following categories:
- More than € 200k: 13% of men fall into this category compared with only 8% of women;
- Between € 151k and € 200k: 14% of men, 12% of women;
- Between € 40k and € 60k: 12% of men and 17% of women; 
- Less than € 40k: 11% of both genders.
