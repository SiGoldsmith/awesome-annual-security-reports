Foreword

We are delighted to present the results of the 2024 Global Risk Manager Survey.

The survey has taken place every other year since 2001\-2002 and represents a comprehensive picture of the views 
of Risk Managers from across Europe. This year, for the first time, the survey was expanded to include responses 
from members of risk management associations across the world, as well as the PwC global network. We would 
like to thank our partners (ALARYS, Club Franco Risk, IRMSA, PARIMA, RIMS, and RMIA) for their valuable 
contributions to making this a global study and enabling us to gather a range of views from across 77 countries. 

Today’s risk landscape is characterised by a need to adapt to immediate short\-term challenges at the same time as 
integrating longer term concerns, such as climate change adaptation and the green transition, into enterprise risk 
management (ERM) frameworks.

The survey highlights the fact that Risk Managers have extended their influence across the organisation and are 
playing a pivotal role in ERM training as well as in promoting and strengthening a risk culture.

We are seeing a growing integration between Risk Managers and Sustainability functions. Risk Managers 
are increasingly involved and influential in the Environmental, Social \& Governance (ESG) activities of their 
organisations, which are a key area of investment for most. 

The quantification of risk remains a challenge, but is a clear focus for Risk Managers, many of whom are using new 
technologies to support them in this area. 

When we consider the strategic insurance priorities of Risk and Insurance Managers, we see a clear focus on long\-
term stability. Risk and Insurance Managers signalled that they increasingly wish to negotiate long\-term insurance 
contracts and make more use of self\-insurance vehicles like captives, to move away from the short\-term nature 
of yearly policy renewals and take into account the looming possibility of certain business activities or locations 
becoming uninsurable in the future. 

In the current climate of polycrisis and interconnected risk, the role of the Risk Manager is becoming more strategic 
than ever. And this continues to evolve against a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty, climate crisis and a digital 
economy, among other emerging risks. 

This international survey shows that the Risk Manager is stepping up to the challenge, helping to build resilient 
organisations that not only mitigate these risks but take advantage of the opportunities of this dynamic environment.

Talent management and data breach have emerged in the Top 5 short\-term risks 
The three other risks remain in the Top 5 of short\-term concerns, however, 
cyber\-attacks and uncertain economic growth have disappeared from the 
Top 3 medium\-term threats. 

At a three\-year horizon, a complete shift was seen, with the entry of two risks 
previously viewed as short\-term: geopolitical uncertainties and regulation. 

This year marks a significant pivot in long\-term risk priorities with only 
environmental concerns cited within the top long\-term risks.

Geopolitical uncertainties dominate short\- and medium\-term concerns, with climate 
and environmental threats topping the concerns in the long term. 

The geopolitical landscape has become more unpredictable, with ongoing conflicts like the 
Ukraine\-Russia tensions and the Israel\-Palestine situation adding layers of complexity and 
uncertainty. 
At the same time, the worsening of climatic conditions, evidenced by the rising frequency and 
intensity of extreme weather events, presents significant challenges. This shift demands 
robust project and risk management and strategic planning to mitigate associated risks.
These evolving risks require Risk Managers to expand their roles, becoming strategic partners 
within their organisations. This involves developing more nuanced approaches to risk 
assessment and mitigation that are attuned to changing geopolitical, environmental, and 
demographic dynamics

Key findingsExpanding involvement of the Risk Manager throughout the organisation

The survey illustrated a greater contribution of Risk Managers to: 
• Risk mapping: large involvement in global and strategic risk map; little involvement in 
legal and carbon neutrality risk maps; and moderate involvement for ESG, anti\-corruption, 
cyber, security and supply\-chain risk maps.
• Strategic committees: half of Risk Managers are invited to Board and Executive 
Committees; more than half chair or are members of a Risk Committee. 
• Collaboration with the lines of defence, specifically with ESG. 

91%

of Risk Managers are involved in corporate strategy

To perform their activities, Risk Managers mostly use:

1\. Spreadsheet and slides presentations 
2\. Risk Management Information System (RMIS) or Governance Risk and Control (GRC) tools 

from a vendor 

3\. RMIS or GRC in\-house tool
4\. Advanced data\-visualisation tools 
5\. A combination of Artificial Intelligence and generative AI 

Although quantification activities remain a challenge, Risk Managers are investing in new 
technologies to address this.

Same challenges remain over time to develop the use of technology for ERM activities: 
• The heavy investment it represents for the function (50%) 
• The lack of perception of the added value for the function (36%)

Risk management related to the digitalisation of the organisation

Collaboration between ERM teams and Information Technology (IT) and Information Security 
(IS) teams remains strong in 2024, as it was in 2022\.

89%

of Risk Managers work on AI\-related risk management, mainly performing 
regulatory monitoring, or deploy internal policy concerning AI usage.

Key findingsMethodology

The data in this report were collected from an anonymous web\-based survey distributed through 
FERMA’s member associations and other continents’ associations, as well as the PwC global network 
between January and April 2024\. 

Until now a European survey, this year the study was extended globally, and responses were gathered 
from 1041 respondents in 77 countries around the world:

Continent

EUROPE
821

NORTH AMERICA

AFRICA
37

SOUTH AMERICA

Although the analysis of the results is conducted on a global scale and ensures a comprehensive understanding 
of the overall trends and insights, responses remain largely from Europe (79%). The dominance of European 
responses is acknowledged, and the low number of respondents in Africa, South America, Asia, and Oceania 
limits the ability to draw conclusions based on geography. 

The differences between continents are highlighted in specific inserts to express the 
differences between the global results, mainly driven by Europe, and the other continents. 

Responses were aggregated into the eight clusters below that are representative in terms of number of 
respondents and geography.

• Oceania (22\): Australia (18\) and New Zealand (4\)

The survey included 56 questions divided into seven categories:

• Your profile (5 questions)

• Your organisation (9 questions)

• Risk Management within the organisation (19 questions)

• Insurance management (6 questions)

• Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) (9 questions)

• Technology risk management (4 questions)

• Digitalisation of the ERM function (4 questions)

Some questions are triggered by the answers to others. Therefore, the number of respondents may vary 
from one question to another. Additionally, some questions were not mandatory so the number of 
respondents per question differs.

Specific survey questions targeted each profile (ERM and IM), providing insights into their respective risk 
management activities. 

The report comprises: a detailed description of the survey respondents; a summary of how Risk Managers 
saw risks in 2024 in an uncertain political and economic context; and the analysis of answers to the sets of 
questions listed above. 

To accompany the report, we have produced 12 files summarising the data per country, continent, 
or group of countries. The repartition of countries within these files is as below:

Profile of survey respondents

Age and gender

The gender distribution among Risk Managers 
has seen minimal change over the years, with the 
proportion of women increasing slightly to 36% 
from 32%.

This gender breakdown remains consistent across 
different sectors, with women being most represented 
in the industry sector at 39% and least in financial 
services at 33%.

In certain geographic areas, women are less well represented. For example, in Asia women 
accounted for only 14% of Risk Managers and in South America 25%. Other continents are 
more balanced, for instance North America where 51% of Risk Managers were women.

There is a gradual increase in the number of women in the profession, notably in the age range 
of between 31 and 35 years old, and this continues to be seen in the age range of those less than 
30 years old.

More than half (53%) of respondents possess more than 10 years of experience, and 17% report having 
between four and six years of experience, mirroring another 17% who indicated having between 7 and 
10 years of experience. This ranking is constant no matter whether in Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), 
or in Insurance Management (IM), or in both.

This high level of experience varies quite significantly in proportion depending on the 
continents where respondents are based: Africa has a significant 22% of respondents 
with fewer than three years of experience (compared with 13% globally). Several clusters 
have a higher proportion of experience of longer than seven years: Asia with 91%; South 
America with 85%; Oceania with 82%; and North America with 75%.

In terms of total annual remuneration, the distribution among respondents globally reflects a varied 
landscape, with remuneration levels remaining relatively steady compared with 2022\.

Gender disparity is particularly pronounced in higher salary brackets, which is consistent with women 
being more represented in the under 35 age bracket and less experienced profiles. The notable difference 
between gender lies in the following categories:

• More than € 200k: 13% of men fall into this category compared with only 8% of women;

• Between € 151k and € 200k: 14% of men, 12% of women;

• Between € 40k and € 60k: 12% of men and 17% of women; 

• Less than € 40k: 11% of both genders.

As in previous editions, respondents include 
mainly Risk or Insurance Managers from 
large organisations, whereas in small and 
medium sized companies, risk management 
responsibilities are often covered in the 
scope of other functions (such as the CFO 
or the Legal Officer). 

Small organisations are more prevalent in the responses collected from South America 
(43%), Africa (35%), and Oceania (27%), and are not represented in Asia.

• The industrial sector was the primary sector to which respondents’ organisations belonged with 41% of 

responses, decreasing by 16% points since the previous survey in 2022\. 

• Financial services followed closely, accounting for 29% of respondents including sectors such as 

insurance (which represented 13% of the total respondents) and banking (9%). This proportion has 
increased from 25% since 2022\.

• Services represented 19% of respondents, an increase from 14% in 2022, covering areas like professional 

and business services, technology, retail, media or healthcare. 

• The public sector accounted for 11% of respondents, encompassing government entities, infrastructure, 
public services, and regulators and representing an increase from 4% since the last edition of the survey.

This trend is mainly driven by Europe as large differences appear in other geographies: 
Africa and South America are mainly represented by Financial Services. North America 
and Oceania are well\-balanced between all sectors.

This year marks a change of representation between 
the three profiles with a larger proportion of ERM profile 
compared with previous editions (\+12% points) and a 
significant decrease of IM profile (\-17% points). The proportion 
of profiles with both titles has increased by 5% points.

• Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) profile: oriented 

towards overall risk management of the organisation. Business 
risks are identified, analysed, treated, and reduced.

• Insurance Management (IM) profile: oriented towards 

insurable risks, including loss prevention and risk transfer.

• Mixed ERM / IM profiles work on insurance, loss prevention 

and wider risk management issues.

Both the ERM/IM profiles’ and ERM profiles’ teams are typically composed of two to three Full 
Time\-Equivalent (FTEs), representing 35% and 34% respectively. IM teams are larger with 31% staffed 
by four to ten FTEs.

Financial Services teams seem to be larger as 27% have more than 10 FTE in their Risk Management 
teams, while this ranges from 13% to 16% in other sectors.

In small organisations, 87% of ERM teams consist of fewer than four people, whereas this is true for 
only 60% of IM departments. The discrepancy persists in medium\-sized organisations where 68% of 
ERM teams are staffed by fewer than four people compared with only 45% of IM teams. However, in large 
organisations, staffing levels for both IM and ERM departments are more aligned.

Among the top 5 other functions, business continuity, internal control and compliance responsibilities 
remain from 2022, although the proportion of compliance decreased by 6% points due to increased 
specialisation by the dedicated compliance department, and internal control moved from 5th to 2nd 
position. The percentage share of internal audit increased to 8% from 6% to enter the top 5, along with 
strategy (newly suggested).

Eight percent of Risk Managers said that their scope includes strategy, reflecting the stronger connection 
between strategic activities and a risk\-based approach. Additionally, ESG (Environmental, Social, and 
Governance) considerations have begun to come under Risk Managers’ responsibilities. This reflects 
the growing integration of ESG into risk management frameworks, highlighting the synergy in addressing 
sustainability and ethical practices alongside traditional risk management activities (refer to part II).

Developing risk maps became the most common responsibility in 2024, up from second and swapping 
position with ERM training and culture, reflecting an increased focus on detailed risk assessment. The 
proliferation of risk maps within the organisation requires a strengthening of risk culture in organisations 
and, notably, greater awareness of the first line of defence. Risk training, beyond developing and 
consolidating the process, is needed to ensure a cohesive and comprehensive approach to risk 
management. Risk quantification has entered the top three responsibilities as Risk Managers are 
asked to provide tangible evidence of risks by employing quantification methods. This approach helps to 
define the ERM governance framework and processes and align risk management more closely 
with the company’s strategy by enhancing decision\-making capabilities for governance (both activities 
have remained in the top 5 responsibilities since 2022\). Design and implementation of controls and 
prevention closely follows in the ranking, demonstrating that the effectiveness of risk control measures 
and potential areas for improvement are increasingly demanded of Risk Managers. This involves thorough 
monitoring of action plans and a well\-structured and equipped process. 

• In Europe, the multiplication of risk maps is partly driven by regulatory expectations, 

such as anti\-bribery and corruption rules or ESG materiality assessments.

• By contrast, in Oceania 88% of Risk Managers are fully responsible for ERM culture and 
training, while 78% are fully responsible for aligning and integrating risk management 
with business strategy and the same proportion of respondents is responsible for 
developing risk maps.

• North America follows the global trend but shows that Risk Managers have a greater 
degree of responsibility with 76% fully responsible for developing risk maps, 72% for 
ERM culture, 66% for ERM governance and 50% for aligning ERM and strategy.
• Responses from the African continent indicate a higher proportion of the ERM 

respondents is fully responsible for risk quantification (62%).

Since 2022, four areas remain among the main activities for Insurance Managers: 

1\. Insurance policy management, claims handling, and loss prevention;

2\. Design and implementation of risk financing strategies, including insurance and alternative solutions;

3\. Assistance to other functional areas in contract negotiation, project management, acquisitions and 

investments;

4\. Design and implementation of risk controls / prevention.

Definition of risk appetite and development of risk maps have dropped out of the top 6 and are replaced 
by the elaboration of the risk assurance map, newly proposed in 2024, and risk quantification, 
demonstrating the importance and reliance on such exercises among the risk management activities and 
broader responsibilities of Insurance Managers.

This new question in 2024 highlights the reporting lines for Risk Managers and shows a diverse distribution: 
26% report to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO); 21% report to the Board; and 21% to the Chief Executive 
Officer (CEO). 

A small percentage report to Internal Audit (2%) or Internal Control (2%) or both (4%), indicating a clearer 
separation between these departments. 

Interestingly, 3% of Risk Managers report to the Chief Strategy Officer, highlighting the increasing 
importance of the Risk Manager’s role in the execution of the strategy and the alignment of risk management 
activities with business strategies.

ERM profiles have strong connections with governance, with 25% reporting to the Board, 24% to the CEO, 
and 17% to the CFO. By contrast, Insurance Managers tend to have a more financial\-oriented reporting 
structure, with 44% reporting to the CFO, reflecting the financial aspect of insurance management, while only 
12% report to the CEO and 9% to the Board, indicating less direct access to top management.

How do Risk Managers see traditional 
and emerging risks in the new world 
of constant crisis? 

The world has fundamentally changed since 2020; crises are no longer shocks, and organisations have 
learned to live with them, developing their resilience, and even learning to seize the opportunities hidden 
behind the crises. A new era of emerging risks has begun, and risk management has become a major 
concern for leaders. Risks are not only expanding rapidly but also becoming increasingly interconnected.

The survey asked Risk Managers to select and rank the major threats to their organisation’s growth 
prospects at different time horizons (12 months, 3 years, and 10 years). The results are presented as follows:

• Top 5 short\-term risks, compared below with previous surveys;

• Top 15 short\-term risks, highlighting their evolution from the previous survey and the new risks identified;

• Two top 3 risks: in a medium term and long\-term perspective.

We observe differences in risks based on varying time horizons, highlighting the need to address 
different timeframes in risk identification exercises and in defining control measures or action plans. 
This approach mirrors the methodologies used in ESG\-related analyses. The goal is to integrate short\-term, 
medium\-term, and long\-term views on risks and opportunities into a unified risk management framework.

Top 5 critical threats to the organisation within the next 12 months

There is broad consistency in the top\-ranked critical threats cited by respondents over the past few years. 
These critical risks dominate the list because of their potentially devastating effects on businesses. 
Cyber\-attacks and data breaches continue to be top threats as digitalisation increases the potential 
scope for attack. Concerns about geopolitical uncertainties and an uncertain economic environment 
reflect the ongoing global instability, notably due to the intensification of tension with the Russia\-Ukraine 
war and the Israeli\-Palestinian conflict, and their repercussions on business operations. The focus on talent 
management highlights the strategic importance of human capital in driving business success and resilience.

The survey results show a dynamic risk environment where technology, workforce issues, and economic 
factors play critical roles. Companies must adapt their risk management strategies to address these 
emerging threats and ensure organisational resilience.

The number of cyber\-attacks continues to increase, exacerbated by the ongoing reliance on digital 
connections and the potential vulnerabilities of hybrid working environments. Organisations are facing more 
sophisticated threats, deriving from new technologies \- notably Artificial Intelligence \- targeting both remote 
and on\-site employees.

In 2024, the geopolitical landscape is marked by heightened tensions and conflicts that significantly 
impact global risk management. The ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia has led to widespread 
economic sanctions, supply\-chain disruptions and energy crises, affecting industries and markets 
worldwide. This conflict has not only strained international relations but also exacerbated concerns about 
cybersecurity, as both state\-sponsored and independent cyber\-attacks have surged. 

The Israeli\-Palestinian conflict remains a source of instability in the Middle East, further complicating 
international diplomatic efforts and creating volatile conditions for businesses operating in or relying on 
resources from the region. These geopolitical tensions highlight the need for robust risk management 
strategies to navigate the complexities of global trade, security, and economic stability.

Cyber\-attacks and geopolitical uncertainties are present in the top 5 risks for all sectors. 

Financial Services named regulation in its top 5 replacing talent management, consistent with the ongoing 
pressure from regulations in this sector.

Industry is more concerned by supply chain or distribution failure than by data breaches, as this sector 
remains the most impacted by the supply chain difficulties observed in recent years that have been 
amplified by the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, and natural disasters.

The public sector highlights HR risks ahead of uncertain economic growth.

Services is more aligned with the global results, with three risks closely mirroring the top 5 (5th ex aequo): 
generative AI use, regulation and fraud or theft. 

On a continent basis, the top short\-term risks are viewed differently:

Africa views the use of technologies and generative AI as two emerging risks of greater 
concern than geopolitical or talent worries. Africa is experiencing rapid technological 
advancements and digital transformation. While these technologies offer significant 
opportunities for growth and development, they also bring risks, such as cybersecurity 
threats, digital divides, and regulatory challenges. The pace of change can outstrip the 
ability of governments and businesses to effectively manage these risks.

Asia sees supply chain failure and changing customer behaviour in the top 5\. Asia is a 
major centre of global production, with many countries in the region playing a key role in 
global supply chains. Interruptions in these chains, whether due to pandemics, natural 
disasters, or geopolitical conflicts, can have serious consequences for companies based 
in Asia and those that depend on products manufactured in the region. Consumer 
behaviours are rapidly evolving, influenced by factors such as technology, cultural 
preferences, environmental concerns, and economic changes. In Asia, where there is a 
great diversity of markets and cultures, companies must constantly adapt to meet the 
changing expectations of consumers. As customers begin to ask more questions about 
environmental and other ESG\-related concerns, companies must adapt to new consumer 
preferences or risk losing relevance.

The survey highlights significant shifts in the risk landscape for the next 12 months. 

Six new risks have emerged in the Top 15 for 2024:

• Talent management

• HR risk (culture, values, psychosocial risk, well\-being)

• Failure to innovate

• Generative AI

• Data breach

• Inflation

The prominence of talent management and HR risk evidences companies navigating changes in 
workforce expectations, remote work, and employee well\-being, and the increasing focus on retention of 
employees, as a response to the ongoing challenges in the labour market, with all sectors more or less 
affected. 

The inclusion of failure to innovate and generative AI underscores the pressure on companies to keep 
pace with technological advancements and harness new technologies effectively, in order not only to 
maintain competitiveness but also to ensure viability. 

Data breach is a critical threat, reflecting the heightened awareness and frequency of cyber incidents. 

Inflation has become a top concern due to the increased costs of energy, materials and labour, as well as 
the increase in interest rates.

FERMA Global Risk Manager Survey Report \- 2024 \| 31

 
 
Additionally, the risk of use of new technologies is tied in 15th place with speed of technological 
change. These underscore a heightened awareness and acknowledgment of the challenges and 
opportunities presented by new technologies and their impact on organisational growth.

Conversely, six risks have dropped out of the top 15:

• Increased societal pressure

• Social instability

• Pandemic risk / health crisis

• Terrorism

• Climate change

• Environmental damage

Companies are better prepared for various crises, drawing on their experience from the past five 
years of navigating multiple unforeseen risks.

In 2022, the top 3 critical risks within the 
next three years were: changing customer 
behaviour; cyber threats; and uncertain 
economic growth. Over two years, the top 
concerns have drastically changed and 
two of these threats are now only observed 
among the short\-term threats.

Regulations have evolved and strengthened in recent years, forcing organisations to adapt and modify 
their way of working to ensure compliance. Compliance regulations for anti\-money laundering, anti\-bribery 
and corruption have been reinforced and large projects to adapt processes within organisations were set 
in motion. ESG regulations now require organisations to take a step forward with TCFD, CSRD, and Green 
Deal with even larger projects and the need to adapt business and/or strategic models.

The speed of technological change, and the increased use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, 
raises significant financial, ethical, and legal questions. The growing dependence on these technologies 
creates vulnerabilities in the event of technological failure or cyber\-attacks. The workforce is challenged to 
adapt while organisations must use technological advances to maintain their competitiveness. 

The current geopolitical uncertainty remains a source of concern over the short and mid\-term horizons. 
The escalation of tensions among major powers, the increasing prevalence of armed conflict, and the 
persistence of terrorism pose major threats to international peace and security. They also pose risks to 
companies with potential threats to business operations and supply chains.

Organisations need to invest in these areas and adapt their business and strategic models towards 
environmental and low\-carbon transitions. Risk Managers need to position themselves at a strategic level 
and work with subject\-matter experts to ensure that their organisations have an appropriate strategy to 
meet stakeholders’ expectations: a sustainable strategy and model, that is socially and environmentally 
respectful, maintaining the viability of the organisation in a constrained environment. 

Climate change adaptation is ranked as a medium\-term concern for Africa and North 
America, and environmental damages and natural disasters are respectively in the top 3 
threats within the next three years for Asia and South America. All continents except Asia 
consider two of their three top risks in the long term to be related to the environment 
either through climate\-change adaptation or the carbon\-neutrality transition.

This raises questions about the prioritisation of risks. Operational risks and short\-term concerns such as 
regulatory compliance and supply\-chain disruption tend to be more thoroughly considered and managed. 
Work to accompany organisations with the strategic threats and climate emergency pose significant 
challenges that are hard to tackle and have been perceived as a threat in the long term for the past five years.

Generative AI use, an emerging and rapidly advancing risk, has risen up the list of concerns organisations try 
to cautiously integrate. Cyber\-attacks, which were the second highest risk lacking consideration in 2022, have 
dropped to 10th position with 15% of responses in 2024\. Geopolitical uncertainties have risen to second 
from third place.

There is a need for the Risk Manager, who traditionally focused on operational and short\-term risks, to take the 
lead in guiding the company on the sustainability of its strategic and business models. This involves laying the 
groundwork for medium and long\-term risk management, ensuring the company’s resilience and adaptability in 
the face of evolving challenges.

The global risk map and the strategic risk map are those for which Risk Managers are most frequently fully 
responsible.

For all risk mapping exercises, about one third of respondents validate or coordinate and provide the 
methodology, and 12% on average are fully responsible for other risk maps as well. 

All types of risk maps are at least performed by 75% of respondents’ organisations (70% for the net\-zero 
transition risk map).

In North America, about half of respondents’ organisations do not perform a series of risk 
maps: net\-zero transition (61%), anti\-corruption (58%), supply\-chain (48%), ESG (47%), and 
legal (43%). 
In Oceania, 45% are not performing any ESG and legal risk maps. 
In South America, about 45% are not performing any anti\-corruption, net\-zero transition 
or supply\-chain risk maps.

demonstrating the increasing importance of the risk management function being at the core decision centre. 
Risk Managers’ presence in strategic committees (newly suggested in answers) has margin of improvement.

Risk Managers’ participation in the audit committee ranks 3rd with 43% either a permanent member or 
invited and participate on an ad\-hoc basis.

Additionally, two third of the respondents’ organisations hold a Risk committee (either dedicated or included 
in audit committee), with the highest direct involvement either by chairing the committee or by being a 
permanent member.

Overall, collaboration between Risk Managers and the first and second lines of defence remain 
stable compared with 2022\.

Some 40% of Risk Managers have close, regular collaboration with the first line of defence; 42% with the

Relations with comparison

Evolution since 2022

New

The radar above shows the lines of defence by levels of interactions: 

 First rank partners – with whom the risk management function has a regular or close relationship, 
based on a clear mandate 
 Second rank partners – with whom the risk management function has a more distant relationship 
and occasional collaboration 
 Third rank partners – with whom relationships can be improved, as there is little or no relationship or 
involvement 

The functions from the first line where the relationship or involvement is the most limited are with Merger and 
Acquisitions and Investments and Investor Relations. The most significant increase in collaboration with the 
first line relates to ESG, with close collaboration rising by 12 points, following the same trend as two years 
ago (also an increase of 12 points).

Analysing the focus of Risk Managers within the corporate strategy, there are notable changes and 
emerging priorities in 2024:

• 70% of respondents work on strategic risk response, a 9% points increase from 2022;

• 53% analyse sustainability risks and impacts, up from 40% in 2022;

• The discovery of opportunities related to strategic risks increases from 28% in 2022 to 47%. 

This suggests there is better alignment of risk management with the corporate strategy and the interest 
for strategy functions to work with a fully embedded risk\-based approach to reveal opportunity and 
adapt business strategy.

• The digital stakes are another main focus with 32% of Risk Managers working on digital 

transformation (compared with 16% in 2022\), and 20% on the Artificial Intelligence impact (newly 
suggested in 2024\).

Regarding the contributions to strategic risks response, 50% of Risk Managers are working on disruption 
risks, 44% consider geopolitical risks and related opportunities, and 37% are performing scenario 
testing on the business plan. 

This ranking can vary significantly depending on the respondents’ continents:
• In South America opportunities related to strategic risks rank first;
• They are ranked in second position in Africa;
• In Asia geopolitical risk and related business impacts rank second.

Risk management tools and risk culture are also both focuses on the two lines of horizon. 
It demonstrates the will of risk management function to use new technologies, tools and data to improve 
 its efficiency, and its fundamental role in strengthening the risk culture in day\-to\-day operations. 

Risk\-based planning to identify resource requirements is the least pressing consideration for the 
next 1 to 2 years, but is the second most important for the next 3 to 5 years. In the immediate term, 
organisations are likely focusing on building resilience capabilities, aligning stakeholders in understanding 
existing and emerging risks. As organisations look towards the medium to long term, risk\-based planning 
becomes a critical consideration to allow organisations to align their resources with their strategic 
objectives and risk appetite.

• Respondents from North America exhibit a significant difference for the two timelines: 
integration of Risk Management and Sustainability / ESG is the least important area 
of investment for the next 2 years but the major one on a 3 to 5 years horizon. 
In the short\-term the focus is on risk mitigation and resilience. 

• Oceania seeks to invest in risk appetite and assessment in the short\-term, rather 
than on integrating ERM and ESG (second to last), and focuses on risk culture at 
a medium\-term horizon.

• South America also is looking at risk assessment and monitoring over the short\-term, 
with integration of ERM and ESG being third to last for the near future but the main 
priority over the next 3 to 5 years.

The maturity of the Enterprise 
Risk Management model

This year’s survey reveals the level of maturity in managing basic risk management activities.

Half of respondents’ organisations have the highest maturity score for their risk assessment 
approach. They conduct an annual comprehensive risk assessment, including identification of 
emerging risks, and with specific monitoring of key risks.

internal and external data to monitor relevant risks and dedicated tools / dashboard;

2\. But some 23% are less mature, relying solely on internal data for KRI to monitor relevant risks and 

dedicated tools / dashboards;

Difficulty quantifying sustainability risks remains the main challenge in 2024, and this is directly related 
to the next two most highly ranked challenges. This is a complex process that requires grappling with the 
limited availability of data to enable precise quantification of ESG\-related risks, such as internal 
data about the company’s activities and resources. Additionally, quantifying risks requires knowledge of 
sustainability risks within ERM team that is still lacking some organisations. 

 50 \| FERMA Global Risk Manager Survey Report \- 2024

However, significant progress has been made in defining and qualifying sustainability risks. This challenge 
has moved downwards from being the second biggest challenge to the fourth (\-7% points) since 2022\. This 
improvement aligns with the increased collaboration between Risk Managers and ESG teams: the challenge 
of limited collaboration between Sustainability and ERM teams decreased by 5% points.

Moreover, 44% of respondents have a regular, close collaboration based on a clear mandate (\+12% points) 
and 10% have sustainability under their responsibility (\+4% points). This trend indicates a convergence 
between the ERM and sustainability approaches.

Risk Managers are now playing a crucial role in ESG\-related activities, with a significant decrease in the 
percentage of those not informed (from an average of 24% in 2022 to 10% in 2024\). The three main areas 
where Risk Managers have full responsibility or provide validation are:

• The analysis and mapping of ESG risk

• The definition of the ESG risk framework 

• The reporting of the ESG risks to the Board or its Committees 

This emphasises the importance of Risk Manager providing the appropriate methodology and framework 
to ensure a consistent methodology in analysing, mapping and reporting on risks. Additionally, 15% of 
Risk Managers are fully responsible for ESG risk mapping; 37% validate or coordinate and provide the 
methodology; 30% are informed; and 17% report that their organisations do not perform ESG risk mapping 
(refer to part I ). 

The involvement of the Risk Manager in ESG is evident in their participation in ESG committees: 21% chair 
or are permanent members; 25% are invited; and 16% receive the meeting minutes. Only 37% are not 
involved in any capacity (refer to part I ).

Climate change adaptation remains the number one critical threat for organisations within the next 10 years, 
despite being also ranked third among risks that are considered not adequately treated. Consequently, 
evaluating climate risks and impacts remains the top priority for companies. Some 60% of organisations 
identify climate change risks in their risk maps, up from 54% in 2022\. The number of Risk Managers working 
on different climate\-change scenarios has increased by 5 percentage points and quantifying the financial 
impact of physical climate change risks represents a top 3 activity. 

Work on transitional risk seems to be more integrated within corporate strategy and therefore less of a focus 
for Risk Managers than getting a more holistic and strategic approach based on scenario, demonstrating a 
higher level of maturity.

• In Africa, 50% of respondents work on climate change risks, 67% in Oceania.
• In North America, a majority work on resilience to physical risk.
• In Northern Europe, 60% also work on different climate\-change scenarios.

Interestingly, 70% of respondents’ organisations perform a specific dedicated risk mapping exercise on the

Rights\-related activities.

The financial services sector has the greatest potential for improvement in social matters, with less than 
20% of activities being deployed on average. While other sectors may have faced long\-standing challenges 
related to social issues, the financial services industry has been less impacted by Human Rights concerns for 
instance, such as child labour issues with third parties.

The evolution of Sustainability reporting regulations has resulted in a strengthening of the identification and 
assessment of these risks for 19% of respondents. The adoption of double materiality is 3rd, mainly driven 
by Northern and Western Europe that ranked it as their 2nd main evolution from regulatory requirements. 

Indeed, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) (refer to adjacent insert) came into force 
in Europe with the aim of encouraging sustainable development in businesses and identifying those that are 
disciplined in this regard. The information expected will be disclosed and allow for a better assessment of 
what is referred to as double materiality:

• risks and opportunities arising from social and environmental issues that impact the company (financial 

materiality);

• impacts of the company’s activities on people and the environment (impact materiality).

 56 \| FERMA Global Risk Manager Survey Report \- 2024

Most regions around the world have developed Sustainability reporting regulations to enforce 
companies’ ownership of their sustainability impact and practices.

Europe: The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) entered into force in 2023\. It modernises 
and strengthens the rules concerning the social and environmental information that companies must 
report. It requires all large companies and all listed companies to disclose information assessed through 
the double materiality approach. The new rules will ensure that investors and other stakeholders have 
access to the information they need to assess the impact of companies on people and the environment and 
for investors to assess financial risks and opportunities arising from climate change and other sustainability 
issues. 

United States: ESG disclosure simplification Act (House of Representatives 202\) requires public 
companies to disclose more information about their ESG practices. SEC Climate\-Related Disclosures/ESG

Focus on ESG\-related risks reporting to external stakeholders

Most respondents (40%) said that the financial statements and sustainability reports of their organisations 
include integrated risk disclosure incorporating disclosure on ESG\-related risks, reflecting the highest level 
of maturity. Additionally, 59% of respondents fall within the top 2 maturity levels for ESG disclosure, while 
15% report no external ESG risk disclosure, indicating a robust integration of ESG considerations.

The role of 
the Risk Manager 
in the digital 
transformation

FERMA Global Risk Manager Survey Report \- 2024 \| 59

Use of technologies widespread across 
all risk management activities 

In the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the rapid acceleration of technological change, digitalising risk 
management activities is essential to maintain pace and relevance. Investing in digital risk management 
tools is the second most important priority of Risk Managers within the next 1 to 2 years (refer to part I ). 
However, despite the clear advantages of digital risk management solutions, persistent barriers to further 
investment continue to hinder their full adoption. 

Artificial Intelligence enters the top 5 of technologies used in risk management activities

Spreadsheet and slides presentations are by far the most used applications (by 88% of respondents), 
for performing all ERM activities represented.

These are followed by Risk Management Information System (RMIS) or Governance Risk and Control 
(GRC) tools, either in\-house systems or purchased from vendors, which are equally used (40% and 
39% respectively). Interestingly, in\-house tools represent the same proportion as tools from the market, 
probably because they allow users to collaborate on shared internal data. The respondents use a RMIS 
or a GRC tool to perform risk assessment and risk mapping activities, risk monitoring, and action plan 
monitoring. 

The use of advanced data\-visualisation tools has increased by 4 points since 2022 and these are now 
used across all ERM activities. 

The results show an increased use of Artificial Intelligence to perform ERM activities from 9% in 2022 to 
13% in 2024 as well as the use of generative AI (13%) which is a new category this year. In total, 26% of 
the respondents use AI to perform some of their activities. 

All the listed technologies are used across all the described activities. Each technology is applied to 
roughly the same extent for each activity.

 60 \| FERMA Global Risk Manager Survey Report \- 2024

More digitalised risk management and quantification activities

Risk identification and assessment remains the main technology\-backed activity of Risk Managers. 
Interactive visualisation of risk maps has more than doubled from 33% of respondents in 2022 to 
71%, closely followed by action plan monitoring which increased from 27% in 2022 to 70%. The use of 
technology in the risk reporting process slightly increased by 10 points, but now ranks in fourth position

Quantification is newly proposed and enters the top 5 with 67% of respondents citing it as an activity 
using technology and it is the second ranked technology\-backed activity for the Services sector (74%). 
Key Risk Indicators (KRI) monitoring is the second activity for the Financial Services (73%), while it is the 
seventh ranked, with 64%, for all other sectors. 

The notable rise in the use of technologies for interactive visualisation of risk maps and action plan 
monitoring indicates that Risk Managers are prioritising dynamic and real\-time insights to enhance the 
decision\-making process. The slight increase in risk reporting and the introduction of quantification in the 
top activities indicate a shift towards more precise data\-driven approaches. 

Scenario analysis is now performed through technologies by 50% of the respondents, compared with 
31% in 2022\. The rise of scenario analysis leveraging technological advancements is driven by the need to 
address complex risks, comply with regulatory requirements, support strategic decision\-making, integrate 
ESG considerations and enhance overall risk awareness.

A minority of Risk Managers perform alert feedback and predictive risk analysis, supported by digital 
technologies.

The claims process is more digitalised and went up from 21% to 57% this year when looking at Insurance 
Managers’ results.

Challenges remain to develop more data and technology usage for Risk Managers

Despite the advantages in efficiency, automation and gaining capacity for anticipating risk, Risk Managers 
face obstacles to more wide adoption of new technologies:

• The heavy investment it represents for the function (50% in 2024, 45% in 2022, 50% in 2020\) ;

• The lack of perception of the added value for the function (36% in 2024, 39% in 2022, 52% in 2020\).

These findings align with the results on the corporate strategy focus where the digital transformation of 
the organisation and /or internal function was chosen by 32% of respondents, putting it at eighth position, 
closely followed by the impact of AI on the business model and/or internal functions cited by 20% of 
respondents (refer to part I ).

Managing risks arising from emerging 
technologies

While Risk Managers are working on their own function’s digitalisation, they contribute to dealing with 
the risks arising from emerging technologies used or likely to be used within the organisation. As new 
technologies emerge at a rapid pace, organisations face a plethora of potential risks and the Risk Manager’s 
role is crucial in safeguarding the organisation’s assets, reputation, and continuity of operations. 

A stable close relationship between risk management teams and IT and IS teams

Maintaining a close relationship with the IT and IS functions is imperative to allow Risk Managers to 
gain insights into emerging technologies, understand potential risks, and develop proactive strategies to 
address them effectively. This partnership fosters a culture of risk awareness and resilience within the 
organisation, enabling it to adapt and thrive in the face of technological disruptions. As expected in this 
environment, Risk Managers maintain a high level of collaboration with IT (52% versus 49% in 2022\), and 
Information Security teams (53% in 2024 versus 52% in 2022\).

Technological risk mapping requires expertise

Risk Managers are less involved in cybersecurity / IT / data risk mapping than in other areas (such as 
corruption, ESG), and are mainly informed of such risk map (44%). However, almost half of respondents are 
involved: 25% coordinate and provide the methodology; 12% validate; and 11% are fully responsible for 
performing those risk mapping exercises (refer to part 1 ).

The combination of these three risks in most cases seems to indicate Risk Managers are treating these 
risks at a macro level. More granular analysis is often delegated to specialist functions as they require 
expertise. Indeed, such risks hide very different related\-risks and mitigation actions, for instance for cyber 
risks: ransomware, malware infection, denial of service, or IP/ credential thefts. While Risk Managers are 
key to providing the methodological guidelines, the assessment itself remains with subject\-matter experts.

Early involvement of Risk Managers in the adoption of new technologies

Cyber\-attacks and data breach are in the Top 5 of threats within the next 12 months. It is interesting to 
observe that within 10 years, most technological threats are no longer in the Top 10\. 

Some 79% of Risk Managers are involved in the risk management of technological and/or digital

Growing regulation of Artificial Intelligence.

With the accelerated technological development of Artificial Intelligence and associated risks (access to 
historical data, the creation of unverified information deepfakes, etc.), governments are working towards 
regulating its usage.

Several regions and countries has developed regulations such as:
• AI Act in Europe
• Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights in the United States
• Algorithmic Accountability Act in the United States
• Artificial Intelligence and Data Act in Canada
• Interim Measures for the Management of Generative AI in China

The EU Artificial Intelligence Act was adopted by the European Parliament in June 2023\. The proposed 
law on AI follows a risk\-based approach, which provides rules tailored to the level of risk generated 
using AI. It has set 4 different levels of risk and associated requirements, from minimal risk with limited 
requirements to unacceptable risk with forbidden usage of certain types of AI.

The objectives are to:
• Ensure that algorithms protect individuals and their fundamental rights.
• Enable European actors to gain competitiveness against other actors.

It will apply to all actors using AI\-based systems in Europe.

Managers 
exploring 
alternative risk 
transfer solutions 

FERMA Global Risk Manager Survey Report \- 2024 \| 67

Insurance market conditions remained 
tough over the past 12 months

Overall, the market continues to be influenced by broader economic trends, regulatory changes, and evolving 
risk landscapes, necessitating careful navigation by both insurers and insureds. In this context, Insurance 
Managers must understand market trends and provide appropriate analysis to decision\-makers to continue 
adapting strategies and efficiently cover risks.

The most impactful trends in the insurance market from the 12 past months show consistency with the results 
from previous survey: increase in premiums remains the most significant trend; reduction in capacity and 
exclusion of specific risks follow. Wording changes moves up to fourth position, from sixth in 2022\.

Africa stands out by ranking “lack of innovative insurance solutions” in second place 
(compared with fifth position globally), highlighting the significant market demand in Africa 
to manage risks in a market that currently lags in insurance development and maturity. 

Consequently, Insurance Managers rely on the same insurance strategy changes to their insurance 
programmes as in 2022:

• Changes to the insurance buying pattern, to reduce premium expenses in a fluctuating insurance 

market, and review their coverage with regards to the risks landscape evolution. Additionally, new insurance 
market conditions and solutions emerge and require Insurance Managers’ awareness and assessment.

• Strengthen loss prevention activity, to anticipate further hardening conditions on the insurance market 

and remain attractive for insurers.

 68 \| FERMA Global Risk Manager Survey Report \- 2024

Africa and Oceania rank this as their top insurance strategy over the past 12 months.

• Negotiate long\-term agreements, to stabilise costs and coverage and secure favourable terms and 

conditions, in a context where the insurance market seeks to adapt to constant crisis. Insurance Managers 
are forced to strike a balance between their assessments of risks over a long\-term horizon and insurance 
contracts that are still frequently short\-term in scope.

• In addition, implementation or further use of captive facilities may appear beneficial when considering 

long\-term risk.

More than half of respondents think some of their business activities or locations will become

there was a large reduction in cyber risk coverage only for 8% of respondents in 2024, a considerable 
improvement compared with the 33% reported in 2022\. This trend indicates a stabilisation or re\-evaluation 
of cyber risk strategies, with fewer companies experiencing drastic changes in their cyber risk coverage.

a reduction in 2024\. Natural catastrophe risks continue to be a significant concern for insurers and insureds 
alike, with limited progress in expanding coverage options.

More than two\-thirds, 37%, of Insurance Managers report a reduction for property damage and/or

Increased adoption of captives in 
risk management strategies

Slight increase in setting up a captive as a strategy for the next two years

In 2022, 73% of respondents indicated a preference for risk retention, compared with 62% in 2024, 
reflecting the importance of risk transfer within risk management solutions. This change indicates a growing 
interest in more structured and alternative approaches. 

The use of existing captive remains the second most commonly cited strategy of Insurance Managers, 
while the creation of captive insurance or reinsurance companies rose to 17% of responses in 2024 from 
12% in 2022\. This suggests that organisations are seeking more tailored and controlled mechanisms to 
manage their risks.
