Survey Report
2024

We are delighted to present the results of the 2024 Global Risk Manager Survey.
The survey has taken place every other year since 2001-2002 and represents a comprehensive picture of the views
of Risk Managers from across Europe. This year, for the first time, the survey was expanded to include responses
from members of risk management associations across the world, as well as the PwC global network. We would
like to thank our partners (ALARYS, Club Franco Risk, IRMSA, PARIMA, RIMS, and RMIA) for their valuable
contributions to making this a global study and enabling us to gather a range of views from across 77 countries.
Today’s risk landscape is characterised by a need to adapt to immediate short-term challenges at the same time as
integrating longer term concerns, such as climate change adaptation and the green transition, into enterprise risk
management (ERM) frameworks.
The survey highlights the fact that Risk Managers have extended their influence across the organisation and are
playing a pivotal role in ERM training as well as in promoting and strengthening a risk culture.
We are seeing a growing integration between Risk Managers and Sustainability functions. Risk Managers
are increasingly involved and influential in the Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) activities of their
organisations, which are a key area of investment for most.
The quantification of risk remains a challenge, but is a clear focus for Risk Managers, many of whom are using new
technologies to support them in this area.
When we consider the strategic insurance priorities of Risk and Insurance Managers, we see a clear focus on long-
term stability. Risk and Insurance Managers signalled that they increasingly wish to negotiate long-term insurance
contracts and make more use of self-insurance vehicles like captives, to move away from the short-term nature
of yearly policy renewals and take into account the looming possibility of certain business activities or locations
becoming uninsurable in the future.
In the current climate of polycrisis and interconnected risk, the role of the Risk Manager is becoming more strategic
than ever. And this continues to evolve against a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty, climate crisis and a digital
economy, among other emerging risks.
This international survey shows that the Risk Manager is stepping up to the challenge, helping to build resilient
organisations that not only mitigate these risks but take advantage of the opportunities of this dynamic environment.

### Varying threats arising from different temporal perspectives

The results highlight the importance of managing different timeframes in risk management.

FERMA Global Risk Manager Survey Report - 2024  |  9

**Top 5 risks within the next 12 months**

*   Cyber-attacks
*   Geopolitical uncertainties
*   Uncertain economic growth
*   Talent management
*   Data breach

**Top 3 risks within the next 3 years**

*   Regulation
*   Geopolitical uncertainties
*   Speed of technological change

**Top 3 risks within the next 10 years**

*   Climate change adaptation
*   Carbon neutrality transition
*   Natural disaster

*   Talent management and data breach have emerged in the Top 5 short-term risks
*   The three other risks remain in the Top 5 of short-term concerns, however, cyber-attacks and uncertain economic growth have disappeared from the Top 3 medium-term threats.
*   At a three-year horizon, a complete shift was seen, with the entry of two risks previously viewed as short-term: geopolitical uncertainties and regulation.
*   This year marks a significant pivot in long-term risk priorities with only environmental concerns cited within the top long-term risks.
*   Geopolitical uncertainties dominate short- and medium-term concerns, with climate and environmental threats topping the concerns in the long term.
*   The geopolitical landscape has become more unpredictable, with ongoing conflicts like the Ukraine-Russia tensions and the Israel-Palestine situation adding layers of complexity and uncertainty.
*   At the same time, the worsening of climatic conditions, evidenced by the rising frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, presents significant challenges. This shift demands robust project and risk management and strategic planning to mitigate associated risks.
*   These evolving risks require Risk Managers to expand their roles, becoming strategic partners within their organisations. This involves developing more nuanced approaches to risk assessment and mitigation that are attuned to changing geopolitical, environmental, and demographic dynamics.

**Image Description:** A graphic showing three columns labeled "12 months", "3 years", and "10 years". Each column lists the top risks for that timeframe. The 12 months column lists "Cyber-attacks", "Geopolitical uncertainties", "Uncertain economic growth", "Talent management", and "Data breach". The 3 years column lists "Regulation", "Geopolitical uncertainties", and "Speed of technological change". The 10 years column lists "Climate change adaptation", "Carbon neutrality transition", and "Natural disaster".

### Expanding involvement of the Risk Manager throughout the organisation

The survey illustrated a greater contribution of Risk Managers to:

*   Risk mapping: large involvement in global and strategic risk map; little involvement in legal and carbon neutrality risk maps; and moderate involvement for ESG, anti-corruption, cyber, security and supply-chain risk maps.
*   Strategic committees: half of Risk Managers are invited to Board and Executive Committees; more than half chair or are members of a Risk Committee.
*   Collaboration with the lines of defence, specifically with ESG.

**Image Description:** A table showing the level of responsibility of Risk Managers for various ERM activities. The activities listed are "Definition of risk appetite", "Alignment and integration of Risk Management as part of strategy", "Risk quantification", "Definition of ERM governance, framework, processes, and/or tools", "ERM training and culture", and "Development of risk maps". For each activity, the table shows the percentage of Risk Managers who are "Not done within my company", "I am informed", "I validate", and "I am fully responsible".

*   **91%** of Risk Managers are involved in corporate strategy (fully, mostly, or partially), stable compared with 2022.

### Pivotal role of the Risk Manager in ESG activities

Climate-change adaptation and the Social aspects of ESG growing in importance

Integration between Risk Management and Sustainability / ESG is the main area of investment for both the next 1 to 2 years, and the next 3 to 5 years, showing the will to mature in this area.

*   **57%** of Risk Managers contribute to the analysis and mapping of ESG-related risks
*   **43%** participate in the definition of an ESG risk framework
*   Difficulty quantifying sustainability risks remains the main challenge in 2024.

**Climate change**

*   **81%** of Risk Managers’ organisations address climate change risks by integrating them into their risk mapping. + 6% points
*   **1/3** perform a dedicated risk mapping exercise on the carbon neutrality transition.

**Social**

*   **60%** of the respondents are engaged in activities related to social risks.
*   **3/4** have or are setting up dedicated Human Rights risk maps.

The integration of ESG/Sustainability challenges in risk management continues to grow

**Image Description:** A pie chart showing that 57% of Risk Managers say they are involved in the assessment of ESG-related risks, while 43% are not.

*   **70%** of Risk Managers say they are involved in the assessment of ESG-related risks (in 2022, 35% said they were playing a role and 21% were planning to become involved).

FERMA Global Risk Manager Survey Report - 2024  |  11

### Ongoing enhancement of ERM and involvement in digital transformation

**Use of technology in risk management activities**

**Image Description:** A series of horizontal bar graphs showing the percentage of Risk Managers using different technologies for various risk management activities. The technologies listed are "Spreadsheet and slides presentations", "Specific integrated Risk Management Information Systems tool", "In-house tool to perform risk management activity", "Advanced tools for visualisation and data analysis", "Artificial Intelligence technologies", "Generative AI", "Web applications", "Process automation technologies", "Internet of things", "Blockchain", and "Drones". The risk management activities listed are "Risk analysis and assessment", "Interactive visualisation of risk mapping", "Risk reporting process", "Action plan monitoring", "Quantification of risk impact", "Risk mitigation", "Key Risk Indicator (KRI) monitoring", "Scenario analysis", "Predictive risk analysis", "Claims process", and "Alert feedback".

Risk management related to the digitalisation of the organisation

1.  Spreadsheet and slides presentations
2.  Risk Management Information System (RMIS) or Governance Risk and Control (GRC) tools from a vendor
3.  RMIS or GRC in-house tool
4.  Advanced data-visualisation tools
5.  A combination of Artificial Intelligence and generative AI

Although quantification activities remain a challenge, Risk Managers are investing in new technologies to address this.

Same challenges remain over time to develop the use of technology for ERM activities:

*   The heavy investment it represents for the function (50%)
*   The lack of perception of the added value for the function (36%)

Collaboration between ERM teams and Information Technology (IT) and Information Security (IS) teams remains strong in 2024, as it was in 2022.

*   **89%** of Risk Managers work on AI-related risk management, mainly performing regulatory monitoring, or deploy internal policy concerning AI usage.

To perform their activities, Risk Managers mostly use:

### Tougher insurance market conditions lead to alternative strategies

**Over the past 12 months**

**Top 3 trends that impacted the insurance market:**

1.  Increase in premium
2.  Reduction in capacity
3.  Exclusions for specific risks

Consequently, 42% of Insurance Managers observe a reduction in natural catastrophe coverage, the most affected policy of those asked about in this study.

In this context, Insurance Managers adapted their insurance strategy by:

*   Changing their insurance buying pattern (54%): reviewing needs, limits and sub-limits
*   Strengthening loss prevention activity (44%)
*   Negotiating long-term agreements (30%)
*   Setting up or marking further use of captive facilities (28%)

**Over the next two years**

Risk retention remains the primary strategy (62%), closely followed by the use of an existing captive for 35% of Insurance Managers, with another 17% of them inclined to create a captive insurance / re-insurance vehicle.

Parametric insurance enters the top strategies used by respondents in this year’s study, and is cited by 19% of the respondents.

A stable proportion of respondents report that they have been using a captive or similar vehicle since the study in 2020. However, this year, a further 10% of respondents said they are considering implementing this risk transfer solution.

**Image Description:** A horizontal bar graph showing the risk financing strategies used by Insurance Managers. The strategies listed are "Risk retention", "Use an existing captive", "Create a captive insurance/ re-insurance company", "Parametrics", "Use alternative risk transfer vehicles", "Mutualisation", and "Other".

*   **53%** of Insurance Managers think some risks, activities, or locations will become uninsurable in the near future.

# Methodology

and survey
respondents

FERMA Global Risk Manager Survey Report - 2024  |  15

The data in this report were collected from an anonymous web-based survey distributed through
FERMA’s member associations and other continents’ associations, as well as the PwC global network
between January and April 2024.
Until now a European survey, this year the study was extended globally, and responses were gathered
from 1041 respondents in 77 countries around the world:

**Methodology**

**Geographic Distribution**

*   **53%** WESTERN EUROPE
*   **14%** NORTHERN EUROPE
*   **12%** NORTH AMERICA
*   **11%** CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE
*   **4%** AFRICA
*   **2%** ASIA
*   **3%** SOUTH AMERICA
*   **2%** OCEANIA

Although the analysis of the results is conducted on a global scale and ensures a comprehensive understanding
of the overall trends and insights, responses remain largely from Europe (79%). The dominance of European
responses is acknowledged, and the low number of respondents in Africa, South America, Asia, and Oceania
limits the ability to draw conclusions based on geography.
Responses were aggregated into the eight clusters below that are representative in terms of number of
respondents and geography.

**Respondent Counts by Region**

*   **821** EUROPE
*   **111** NORTH AMERICA
*   **37** SOUTH AMERICA
*   **28** AFRICA
*   **22** ASIA
*   **22** OCEANIA

**Continent**

**Group of countries**

The differences between continents are highlighted in specific inserts to express the
differences between the global results, mainly driven by Europe, and the other continents.

  16  |  FERMA Global Risk Manager Survey Report - 2024

The breakdown of countries included within these continents or clusters is as follows:

*   Western Europe (554 respondents): Italy (167), France (124), Spain (44), Germany (39), Switzerland
    (36), Greece (33), Belgium (29), Luxembourg (22), Netherlands (20), Malta (12), United Kingdom (10),

*   Asia (22): UAE (7), India (3), Hong Kong, China, and Singapore (2), Bahrain, Israel, Japan, Malaysia,
    Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam (1)
*   Oceania (22): Australia (18) and New Zealand (4)

The survey included 56 questions divided into seven categories:

*   Your profile (5 questions)
*   Your organisation (9 questions)
*   Risk Management within the organisation (19 questions)
*   Insurance management (6 questions)
*   Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) (9 questions)
*   Technology risk management (4 questions)
*   Digitalisation of the ERM function (4 questions)

Some questions are triggered by the answers to others. Therefore, the number of respondents may vary
from one question to another. Additionally, some questions were not mandatory so the number of
respondents per question differs.
Specific survey questions targeted each profile (ERM and IM), providing insights into their respective risk
management activities.
The report comprises: a detailed description of the survey respondents; a summary of how Risk Managers
saw risks in 2024 in an uncertain political and economic context; and the analysis of answers to the sets of
questions listed above.
To accompany the report, we have produced 12 files summarising the data per country, continent,
or group of countries. The repartition of countries within these files is as below:

*   One file per continent except Europe: North America, South America, Africa, Oceania, Asia
*   Italy (167)
*   Nordic & Baltic countries (141): Sweden (58), Denmark (32), Lithuania (23), Finland (15), Norway (12)
    and Estonia (1)
*   Central and Eastern Europe (126): Turkey (79), Romania (14), Slovenia (12), Bulgaria (10), Czech
    Republic, Albania, Azerbaijan and Poland (2), Hungary, Belarus, and Kosovo (1)
*   France (124)

# Profile of survey respondents

The gender distribution among Risk Managers
has seen minimal change over the years, with the
proportion of women increasing slightly to 36%
from 32%.
This gender breakdown remains consistent across
different sectors, with women being most represented
in the industry sector at 39% and least in financial
services at 33%.
There is a gradual increase in the number of women in the profession, notably in the age range
of between 31 and 35 years old, and this continues to be seen in the age range of those less than
30 years old.
For the age group between 31 and 35 years, there has been a shift in the last two years: in 2022, 23%
were women, whereas in 2024, 37% are women, marking a 14 percentage points increase. This reflects
a stark generational difference in gender distribution, with a trend towards greater gender balance
among younger age groups.

### Age and gender

**Image Description:** A pie chart showing the gender distribution of respondents, with 36.3% being female, 63.4% being male, and 0.3% being other.

**Image Description:** A table showing the gender repartition by age range. The age ranges are "More than 60 years", "Between 56 and 60 years old", "Between 46 and 55 years old", "Between 36 and 45 years old", "Between 31 and 35 years old", and "Less than 30 years old". For each age range, the table shows the percentage of male and female respondents.

In certain geographic areas, women are less well represented. For example, in Asia women
accounted for only 14% of Risk Managers and in South America 25%. Other continents are
more balanced, for instance North America where 51% of Risk Managers were women.

  18  |  FERMA Global Risk Manager Survey Report - 2024

Most risk management professionals are
experienced, with 63% of respondents
falling between the ages of 36 and 55
years old. By contrast, Risk Managers
under the age of 36 represent just 14%
of respondents in 2024, marking a slow
progression from 12% in 2022.

**Image Description:** A bar graph showing the age distribution of respondents. The age ranges are "Less than 30 years old", "Between 31 and 35 years old", "Between 36 and 45 years old", "Between 46 and 55 years old", "Between 56 and 60 years old", and "More than 60 years old".

*   **9%** Less than 30 years old
*   **14%** Between 31 and 35 years old
*   **34%** Between 36 and 45 years old
*   **28%** Between 46 and 55 years old
*   **9%** Between 56 and 60 years old
*   **4%** More than 60 years old

Participants from Africa and Asia tend to be younger overall: 22% of African respondents
are under 36 years of age, while 27% from Asia fall into this age bracket.
Asia is showcasing a balanced representation across age groups. Most respondents
- 41% - fall between the ages of 46 and 55, with 27% falling between 36 and 45 years old
and a further 27% between 31 and 35 years old.

The profession remains characterised by experienced individuals
and has difficulty in attracting young talent

FERMA Global Risk Manager Survey Report - 2024  |  19

More than half (53%) of respondents possess more than 10 years of experience, and 17% report having
between four and six years of experience, mirroring another 17% who indicated having between 7 and
10 years of experience. This ranking is constant no matter whether in Enterprise Risk Management (ERM),
or in Insurance Management (IM), or in both.
In terms of total annual remuneration, the distribution among respondents globally reflects a varied
landscape, with remuneration levels remaining relatively steady compared with 2022.
Gender disparity is particularly pronounced in higher salary brackets, which is consistent with women
being more represented in the under 35 age bracket and less experienced profiles. The notable difference
between gender lies in the following categories:

*   More than € 200k: 13% of men fall into this category compared with only 8% of women;
*   Between € 151k and € 200k: 14% of men, 12% of women;
*   Between € 40k and € 60k: 12% of men and 17% of women;
*   Less than € 40k: 11% of both genders.

### Professional experience and remuneration

**Image Description:** A bar graph showing the years of experience in ERM/IM. The categories are "Less than 1 year", "1-3 years", "4-6 years", "7-10 years", and "More than 10 years".

*   **53%** More than 10 years
*   **17%** 7-10 years
*   **17%** 4-6 years
*   **10%** 1-3 years
*   **3%** Less than 1 year

Years of experience in Entreprise Risk Management (ERM) / Insurance Management (IM)

This high level of experience varies quite significantly in proportion depending on the
continents where respondents are based: Africa has a significant 22% of respondents
with fewer than three years of experience (compared with 13% globally). Several clusters
have a higher proportion of experience of longer than seven years: Asia with 91%; South
America with 85%; Oceania with 82%; and North America with 75%.

**Image Description:** A bar graph showing the total annual remuneration of respondents. The categories are "Less than € 40k", "Between € 40k - € 60k", "Between € 60k - € 100k", "Between € 101k - € 150k", "Between € 151k - € 200k", and "More than € 200k".

*   **11%** More than € 200k
*   **13%** Between € 151k - € 200k
*   **23%** Between € 101k - € 150k
*   **28%** Between € 60k - € 100k
*   **13%** Between € 40k - € 60k
*   **11%** Less than € 40k

Total annual remuneration (including bonus and compensation)

The profession remains currently dominated by experienced profiles.

### Total annual remuneration by continent

**Image Description:** A series of bar graphs showing the total annual remuneration of respondents by continent. The continents listed are "Oceania", "South America", "North America", "Europe", "Asia", and "Africa". For each continent, the graph shows the percentage of respondents in each remuneration category: "More than € 200k", "Between € 151k - € 200k", "Between € 101k - € 150k", "Between € 60k - € 100k", "Between € 40k - € 60k", and "Less than € 40k".

### Average remuneration per profile

*   **ERM** € 96k
*   **IM** € 121k
*   **Both** € 120k
*   **All** € 109k

Insurance Managers are more highly valued than ERM profiles,
with an average difference of € 25k in compensation.
A real added-value is perceived for profiles with dual expertise.

A closer look at regional trends reveals noteworthy patterns

*   In Africa, 41% earn less than € 40k, whereas only 5% earn more than € 200k.
*   Conversely, in South America, the distribution is more spread in the first three
    remuneration ranges, while earnings above € 200k represent 7% of respondents.
*   Asia and Oceania show a large proportion of respondents earning more than € 101k (55%).
*   North America, however, shows 43% of respondents earning more than € 151k (and 72%
    more than € 101k), and only 5% less than € 60k.

### Organisation and sector

**Image Description:** A pie chart showing the distribution of respondents by type of organisation. The categories are "Listed entity", "Privately held entity", "Public entity", "Branch of a listed entity", "Not for profit", and "Entity owned by venture capitalist".

**Type of organisations’ distribution**

*   **36%** Listed entity
*   **35%** Privately held entity
*   **7%** Public entity
*   **5%** Branch of a listed entity
*   **12%** Not for profit
*   **4%** Entity owned by venture capitalist

High representation of large organisations, listed or privately-owned entities.

**Image Description:** A bar graph showing the distribution of respondents by sector of activity. The categories are "Industry", "Financial services", "Services", and "Public sector".

**Distribution by sector of activity**

*   **41%** Industry
*   **29%** Financial services
*   **19%** Services
*   **11%** Public sector

A better spread of sector of activity within the respondents.

As in previous editions, respondents include
mainly Risk or Insurance Managers from
large organisations, whereas in small and
medium sized companies, risk management
responsibilities are often covered in the
scope of other functions (such as the CFO
or the Legal Officer).

*   The industrial sector was the primary sector to which respondents’ organisations belonged with 41% of
    responses, decreasing by 16% points since the previous survey in 2022.
*   Financial services followed closely, accounting for 29% of respondents including sectors such as
    insurance (which represented 13% of the total respondents) and banking (9%). This proportion has
    increased from 25% since 2022.
*   Services represented 19% of respondents, an increase from 14% in 2022, covering areas like professional
