44 About WatchGuard

In this report, we cover:

**Network-based malware trends:**

WatchGuard Fireboxes have three different network-based anti-malware detection services that block hundreds of thousands of network and malware attacks every day. They include signature-based malware detection, machine learning, and behavioral detection. This section highlights the most prominent and widespread malware our unified threat management (UTM) products saw during Q1. We illustrate the top threats by volume, by most Fireboxes affected, and by region. We cover the differences in malware seen over encrypted connections and how much malware bypasses signature-based detection (which we call zero-day malware). We also highlight interesting malware samples in greater detail. During Q1, we saw network malware volume drop significantly; however, zero-day malware over encrypted connections remains high. We also saw three malware variants on our top 10 list that seem associated with the GoldenSpy campaign.

**Network attack trends:**

The Firebox’s Intrusion Prevention Service (IPS) blocks many client- and server-based network exploits. This section highlights the most common network attacks we saw during Q1, which include common web browser vulnerabilities, web applications, flaws in various web servers and frameworks, and many other network service vulnerabilities. This quarter we saw network attack volume increase quarter-over-quarter (QoQ). One network exploit new to our top 10 list targeted HAProxy, a popular Linux load balancer application. Meanwhile, ProxyLogon remained in the #2 spot on our top attack list.

**Top malicious domains:**

Using data from our DNSWatch service, we share trends about the malicious web links your users click. We prevent your users from reaching these domains, thus protecting your organization, but we still report on the most popular malicious domains they accidentally clicked on. This quarter, DNSWatch found evidence of PandoraSpear, an Internet of Things (IoT) botnet that targets smart TVs.

**Endpoint malware trends:**

We also track the malware trends we see at the endpoint from our WatchGuard EPDR and AD360 products. These malware trends seem to often differ greatly from what network security devices see. While network-detected malware declined, endpoint malware detections increased by 75%. However, the amount of unique and new malware we detected declined. Higher malware volume with less unique malware means that threat actors seemed to spam older threats during Q1, and signature-based detection caught the vast majority of it quickly. Of the browsers used as a malware infection vector, Chromium ones, like Chrome, led the pack. We also found that malicious Excel documents are the most prevalent type of Office document to hide malware.

**The right defenses for the latest attack trends.**

While most this report talks about the latest attack trends, the actual point of it is to give you the current intelligence you need to adjust your defense strategy. Like the anecdote from our introduction, if you know how attacker techniques evolve, you might be able to adjust your protections to avoid that ransomware infection. Throughout this report, and at the end, we share various practical security tips and strategies that could protect you from the attacks we see in the wild.

## INTRODUCTION

Every quarter, I introduce this report with a metaphor or quote on why following trends in cybersecurity is important to doing better at protecting yourself. This time, I figured we’d try a fictional anecdote that isn’t too far from examples of reality.

### The Tale of the Underprepared Hospital

In 2023, a midsize hospital, we’ll call it “MediCare Health,” operated with an arguably reasonable level of cybersecurity measures. They had traditional firewalls, basic antivirus software, and regular employee training sessions on basic cybersecurity hygiene. However, the hospital’s IT team wasn’t particularly vigilant about staying updated on the latest cybersecurity trends and assumed their existing measures were sufficient.

However, ransomware attacks were becoming increasingly sophisticated, targeting specific industries with tailored tactics. A new major trend in ransomware was the exploitation of remote access services that didn’t use multi-factor authentication (MFA) or the use of “double extortion,” where attackers not only encrypted data but also threatened to release sensitive information unless a ransom was paid. Ransomware actors also used more living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques and evasive malware to get past basic defenses. These were significant evolutions from how previous ransomware actors launched their attacks.

Despite the changing and growing threat, MediCare Health didn’t update their ransomware defense strategy. They were unaware of the new trends so never considered additional measures such as improved, more-advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, or MFA for all their employees’ remote logins.

As a result, in early 2024 MediCare Health fell victim to ransomware. The attackers had monitored the hospital’s network for weeks, understanding the critical nature of the data and the hospital’s operations. They broke in with a stolen credential that they used to log in to a remote access service, which did not use MFA. They launched a double extortion attack, encrypting patient records and threatening to release confidential medical information if a hefty ransom wasn’t paid.

The hospital’s IT team was caught off guard. Their backup systems were outdated, and without EDR software and a good incident response plan, they missed the attack until it was too late. In fact, they didn’t even take advantage of their service provider’s managed detection and response (MDR) service. The attackers demanded a ransom of $22 million, and the hospital faced the daunting possibility of patient data being exposed publicly.

The attack had severe consequences. The hospital had to shut down its systems temporarily, affecting patient care and delaying treatments. They eventually decided to pay the full ransom to prevent the data from being released, but the incident not only cost them tens of millions in ransom but even more in system restoration and lost revenue. Additionally, their reputation suffered greatly, and trust among patients was severely damaged.

The moral of the story? It should be obvious. Attackers change their techniques as we change our defenses. What worked yesterday may not work today as threat actors evolve due to our protection strategies. If their old techniques don’t work, they move on to new ones. This is a completely fictional anecdote, but you might notice it shares many similarities to incidents that have happened.

Our quarterly Internet Security Report is designed to help you avoid becoming the victim of this anecdote. By offering the latest quantifiable threat intelligence about cyberattacks our products see each quarter, we hope to uncover the latest attack trends for you, so that you can make the appropriate updates to any defenses you might have missed.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This quarter, our malware trends almost reflectively mirror the opposite of our last report. During Q4 2023, network-based malware detections were up, and endpoint malware detection was down. For Q1 2024, network malware detection dropped by almost half (49%). Meanwhile, endpoint malware volume rose over 75% – the complete opposite of before.

Last quarter, evasive malware detected by our behavioral and machine-learning anti-malware services was up. This quarter, all our advanced malware detection results are down, but signature-based detections are up, both for network and endpoint products. After many years of warning you that you’ll miss over half of malware if you don’t use more advanced detection services, this quarter the good old signature-based detection did most the work.

The network attack story is quite similar. Last time, network attacks had decreased 10%, but during Q1 they increased by 13%. Last quarter, attackers tried more unique network exploits (meaning a greater diversity of types of attacks), this quarter unique attacks are down 16%. Meanwhile, there are some similarities between both quarters too. ProxyLogon – a critical Microsoft Exchange vulnerability that could lead to remote code execution – remained #2 on our top 10 network attack list. We said it before, but if you didn’t patch this over a year ago, you should get on that.

*   Total network-based malware detections dropped nearly in half, down 49%. This was a surprise and distinctly the opposite of last quarter, where it had risen 80%. Malware detections from all our proactive anti-malware services, APT Blocker and IntelligentAV (IAV), were down significantly as well. The only service with a slight increase was our signature-based Gateway AntiVirus service (GAV). However, the amount of malware detected over encrypted connections increased.
*   On the flipside, endpoint malware detections increased greatly, growing over 75% QoQ. To some extent, this makes sense. If products catch less malware at the network, the endpoint likely will see more threats.
*   Malware hiding behind encryption (TLS) increased to 69% in Q1. As we continue to mention, you will miss more than half of malware over a network unless you decrypt HTTPS web traffic. It’s a free feature – enable it.
*   Our “per Firebox” malware results for various network malware detection services:
    *   Average total malware detections per Firebox: 1,224 (~49% decrease)
    *   Average malware detections by GAV per Firebox: 562 (8% increase)
    *   Average malware detections by IAV per Firebox: 587 (58% decrease)
    *   Average malware detections by APT Blocker per Firebox: 75 (85% decrease)
*   We extrapolate that if all the currently active (licensed) Fireboxes with some services were reporting to us and had all malware detection services enabled, we would have had 472,991,544, or almost half a billion malware detections during Q1 2024.
*   Zero-day malware dropped to 36% of all malware during Q1. As a reminder, we define zero-day malware as malware that evades signature-based protection, only detected by more proactive techniques. Our zero-day malware number has historically been much higher; 50% or more. This is the first time in a long time we have seen it drop so low. While that does mean signature-based detection caught a lot last quarter, we still recommend our more proactive anti-malware services.
*   The Pandoraspear botnet, which targets smart TVs running an open-source Android OS, jumped into our top 10 most widely detected malware list, highlighting the potential risk of vulnerabilities in IoT devices for enterprise security.
*   A new variant of the Mirai malware family that targeted TP-Link Archer devices emerged as one of the most-widespread malware campaigns of the quarter. The Mirai variant reached nearly 9% of all WatchGuard Fireboxes around the globe.
*   Network attacks increased 13% quarter over quarter (QoQ), but remain down considerable year-over-year (YoY). On the other hand, unique network attacks, which show the variety of different network exploits attackers use, declined 16%.
*   An HAProxy vulnerability was among the top network attacks of the quarter. HAProxy is a Linux-based load balancer application. The vulnerability, which was first identified in 2023, shows how weaknesses in popular software can lead to a widespread security problem.
*   ProxyLogon continues in the #2 spot of top-exploited attacks during Q1. As a reminder, this was a critical, remote code execution vulnerability against Microsoft Exchange servers that you should have patched long ago. It remains in the number two spot on our top 10.

Now that you know the top highlights from this quarter’s report, it’s time for you to dive into the fascinating and hopefully insightful details. Remember, we aren’t just sharing these malicious trends for fun, but will share practical defensive tips and strategy along the way.

*   The exploits in our top 10 network attacks by volume account for 57% of all detections. Showing that these flaws are by far the ones threat actors (and pen testers) spam the Internet with.
*   Overall, endpoint malware detections increased over 75% by pure volume – a pretty significant increase over previous quarters. Perhaps this increase corresponds to our decrease in network-based malware protections?
*   However, our endpoint protection products only blocked 88 unique malware variants per 100k machines, which is an over 18% decline compared to Q4 2023. Remember, this has nothing to do with volume, but more to do with distinctly unique new variants of malware, which also happen to sometimes evade signature-based protection. When malware detection volume increases, but unique variants per machine decreases, it suggests that attackers might be spamming old variants of malware to many victims, which will easily get detected by our signature-based techniques.
*   Endpoint ransomware attacks continue to decrease, dropping about 23%. Ransomware seems to have plateaued recently. Its decrease is likely due to many takedown efforts by the authorities, such as Lockbit. We do expect to see these variants eventually return despite their takedowns.
*   This quarter, Chromium-based browsers were found to be responsible for producing more than three-quarters (78%) of the total volume of malware originating from attacks against web browsers or plugins, a significant rise compared to the previous quarter (25%).
*   Malicious scripts continue to decline as the most prevalent malware delivery vector. While malicious PowerShell and JavaScript scripts are still the most common living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques for delivering malware, they have continued to decline as Windows binaries have increased.
*   DarkGate leverages malicious AWS and faked Akamai subdomains to lure victims. Remember, some legit domains allow customers to create dangerous subdomains. Meanwhile, attackers still like to squat on domains that seem close to the real one.

## FIREBOX FEED STATS

### HELP US IMPROVE

Our data comes from Fireboxes in our Firebox Feed and the more Firebox admins that provide the anonymous data the better we can make our reports. If you configure your Firebox to do so, we will have more accurate information in this report to apply to your network. So please configure your Firebox to enable device feedback by following these steps.

1.  Upgrade to Fireware OS 11.8 or higher (we recommend 12.x)
2.  Enable device feedback in your Firebox settings
3.  Configure WatchGuard proxies and our security services, such as GAV, IPS, APT Blocker, and DNSWatch, if available

### WHAT IS THE FIREBOX FEED?

The Firebox Feed is our source of anonymized primary data from Firebox customers that have opted in to sharing threat detections with WatchGuard. This data allows us to view the specific malware and exploit activity that threat actors are using against small and midsize organizations worldwide.

In this section, we detail the high-level quarter-over-quarter trends while also diving into the specific top threats that generate either the most alert volume or impact the most unique networks. Through these lenses, we identify trends in the categories of malware or network attacks targeting WatchGuard customer networks and use that information to prescribe specific tips for a strong defense.

We break the Firebox Feed up into three main sections built off telemetry from five security services running on Firebox appliances:

*   Gateway AntiVirus (GAV): Signature-based malware prevention
*   IntelligentAV (IAV): Advanced AI-based malware prevention
*   APT Blocker: Sandboxed, behavioral-based malware prevention
*   Intrusion Prevention Service (IPS): Network-based client and server exploit prevention
*   DNSWatch: Domain-based threat prevention

## MALWARE TRENDS

Most of the data we use from the Firebox Feed comes from proxy policies on the Firebox. Unlike typical stateful packet filters, which just inspect the source, destination, and ports of network traffic, our proxies analyze the body of network packets, allowing our security services to investigate more deeply for threats. When properly configured by the network administrator, the anonymized data from these proxy services allow us to better understand the malware your Fireboxes see each quarter in the wild. By comparing to past data, we can spot changes in trends and identify new techniques that malware adapts to to try to infect more victims.

We draw our own conclusions based on this data, which we share in the report, but we also hope you can use the data to draw conclusions that fit your own business or environment. With this information, network admins, security professionals, and business owners can understand how best to protect themselves from future threats.

We had some interesting malware detection in Q1. One of the most-widespread malware detections, `Bash.MiraiB.C9B4EC13`, targets TP-Link Archer devices and uses a newer exploit (CVE-2023-1389) to gain access to affected wireless routers. It also reuses a lot of code from the Mirai botnet to evolve into a variant called the Miori botnet.

Another sample continues the GoldenSpy fiasco, where users caught government-owned companies spying on their citizens. We saw three different malware variants in our top ten malware related to the GoldenSpy campaign, which we describe in more detail in our malware analysis below. In other developments, the older Agent Tesla malware returns, which leverages an Office exploit and targets healthcare providers.

The malware types we saw during Q1 lead us to believe malware will trend towards targeting IoT devices and continue to use living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques to hide in legitimate software, hoping to enter networks without being detected. During the quarter, we saw a significantly lower volume of malware overall, but the variants we saw also leveraged more advanced attack methods. Before we dive further into these details, let’s begin with a high-level overview of the malware trends from Q1 2024.

### Top 10 Malware Detections

The Top 10 Malware table includes the most detected malware families by total detection volume from reporting Fireboxes. Let’s get into it. In Q1, we saw two new malware families, `Vundo.FKM` and `Trojan.Jeki.2`. We couldn’t find very many details on `Vundo.FKM` since we were unable to recover a sample of the original file that dropped this malware. We believe a worm-like virus drops this malware to steal passwords but can’t be sure without a sample to analyze. We were able to inspect the other newbie, `Trojan.Jeki.2`, though. It was a malicious Office document containing a macro that runs a PowerShell script to download malware containing the Pyxie remote access trojan (RAT). See our deeper analysis of this threat at the end of this section of the report.

We also found three related samples. The three different variants of `Trojan.Heur.RP.Cu2` come from China and arrive as an executable file with the name `qdfpzsShell.exe`. As hinted in the intro of this section, we believe these three samples are a continuation of the GoldenSpy malware campaign. We also found the same Fireboxes that detected these GoldenSpy samples, further detected `GenericKD.70489621` and `Ursu.6302`, which seemed unusual. However, these malware families don’t seem to relate to GoldenSpy in any other way, so we presume this correlation does not offer any causation. `GenericKD.70489621` and `Ursu.6302` download adware and malware like the `2345Explorer` we discussed in our Q1 2023 report.

`Generic.15257`, more of a potentially unwanted program (PUP), identifies the Android version of IPRoyal’s Pawns; a program that pays the user to fill out surveys. Like most PUPs and adware, it connects to servers that also spread a lot of malware. We recommend avoiding these shady programs, especially in a corporate environment.

| Threat Name             | Malware Category   | Count   | Last Seen |
| :---------------------- | :----------------- | :------ | :-------- |
| `Generic.3112968`       | Adware             | 885,177 | Q3 2023   |
| `GenericKD.70489621`    | Dropper            | 787,367 | Q3 2023   |
| `Heur.RP.Cu2@b8XQ9afj`  | Win Code Injection | 739,807 | Q4 2023   |
| `Ursu.6302`             | Dropper            | 632,623 | Q2 2023   |
| `(Android) Generic.15257` | Adware             | 472,817 | Q4 2023   |
| `Heur.RP.Cu2@bGGIINgj`  | Win Code Injection | 346,448 | Q4 2023   |
| `Linux.XORDDoS.AT`      | Dropper            | 166,790 | Q4 2023   |
| `Heur.RP.Cu2@b8XPSEbj`  | Win Code Injection | 139,265 | Q4 2023   |
| `Vundo.FKM`             | Password Stealer   | 109,364 | new       |
| `Trojan.Jeki.2`         | Office Exploit     | 45,636  | new       |

*Figure 1. Top 10 Malware Detections*

### Top 5 Encrypted Malware Detections

All Fireboxes are capable of inspecting encrypted connections and can block malware over these connections. Unfortunately, network admins only configure about one in five Fireboxes to do this. We encourage all network administrators to configure encrypted connection inspection (through our HTTPS proxy) to receive the full benefit of our malware inspection and IPS services. Since most Internet web traffic uses encryption, we believe the malware trends seen within HTTPS connections likely show the real picture. However, because so few Fireboxes enable and report on this feature, we may only have a partial view. For the Fireboxes that do report, 69% of malware detections come from these encrypted connections. To show how malware over encrypted connections differs from general malware detections, we present the Top 5 Encrypted Malware table.

| Threat Name                      | Malware Category   | Hits   |
| :------------------------------- | :----------------- | :----- |
| `Heur2.ObfDldr.9.63A9E772.Gen`    | Office Exploit     | 12,482 |
| `GenericKDZ.92453 (Agent Tesla)` | Win code Injection | 12,237 |
| `Agent.GIKS`                     | Win Code Injection | 12,120 |
| `Logan.749`                      | Password Stealer   | 10,417 |
| `Agent.IIQ`                      | Password Stealer   | 9,579  |

*Figure 2. Top 5 TLS Malware*

The top threat in our Top 5 TLS Malware table, `Heur2.ObfDldr.9.63A9E772.Gen`, is a malicious Microsoft document that exploits an Office vulnerability. Not far behind in the total number of detections, `GenericKDZ.92453` contains a variant of Agent Tesla like the one discussed in Q4 of last year. Closely behind that, `Agent.GIKS` contains a Microsoft Visual Basic Script to inject malicious code. We don’t have a sample to test, but we found a large overlap in devices reporting `GenericKDZ.92453` (Agent Tesla) with devices reporting `Agent.GIKS`. A single malware campaign likely downloaded both. Finishing off the table, we saw two known password stealers, `Logan.749` and `Agent.IIQ`.

### Top 5 Widespread Malware Detections

Now that we have covered the top malware by raw volume, let’s look at the malware we see on the most Fireboxes. This gives us an understanding of widespread malware vs just pure volume. We also believe this better represents what smaller networks see. Smaller networks won’t have the same configurations as larger ones, so malware targets these networks differently. Since larger networks see more traffic overall, their malware volume may distort our analysis of the most common threats without this normalized, widespread view.

Two of the top threats in our Top 5 Widespread Malware table, `RTF-ObfsObjDat.Gen` and `MathType-Obfs.Gen`, are malicious documents exploiting Microsoft Office vulnerabilities, which spread mostly in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). An interesting malware family, `Bash.MiraiB.C9B4EC13` contains a short script that matches a recent campaign to exploit the TP-Link Archer devices. As the name suggests, it contains a variant of the Mirai botnet. We will cover it in more detail later. Finally, `Zmutzy.1305` (a loader/dropper that installed Agent Tesla in the past) and `JS.Agent.USF` (a JavaScript redirector) are two malware variants we saw and discussed last quarter. A staggering 63% of Fireboxes in India saw `JS.Agent.USF`.

| Threat Name          | Top 3 Countries by %   | EMEA % | APAC % | AMER % |
| :------------------- | :--------------------- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
| `RTF-ObfsObjDat.Gen` | Greece - 28.54% Hong Kong - 24.14% Germany - 22.04% | 16.16% | 6.58%  | 4.71%  |
| `Bash.MiraiB.C9B4EC13`| Sweden - 22.77% Denmark - 15.71% Cyprus - 14.77% | 6.44%  | 7.52%  | 8.67%  |
| `MathType-Obfs.Gen`  | Greece - 23.33% Hong Kong - 13.79% Turkey - 13.27%  | 9.40%  | 2.95%  | 3.86%  |
| `JS.Agent.USF`       | India - 62.56% New Zealand - 14.94% Brazil - 14.93%  | 5.50%  | 7.86%  | 9.04%  |
| `Zmutzy.1305`        | Cyprus - 15.91% Greece - 14.64% Hong Kong - 14.48% | 7.67%  | 5.67%  | 2.56%  |

*Figure 3. Most-Widespread Malware*

### Geographic Threats by Region

Identifying threats geographically helps us better understand the regions malware targets most. To calculate these percentages, we first add the total number of malware detections in each region. However, since each region varies in the number of Fireboxes reporting in, we next divide the number of detections over the number of Fireboxes in that region to get a normalized number of detections per Firebox in the region. To make it easier to read, we finally convert these numbers to percentages. This provides a chart to see what regions detect the most malware without regional Firebox sales skewing results.

| Region | % Share |
| :----- | :------ |
| AMER   | 22.5%   |
| EMEA   | 14.71%  |
| APAC   | 62.76%  |

*Figure 4. Geographic Threats by Region*

[A pie chart visually representing the data in the table above, showing the percentage share of malware detections by region: Americas (22.5%), EMEA (14.71%), and APAC (62.8%).]

This quarter, we, by far, saw the most malware volume in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region at 62.7% of regional malware. This was a 20-point increase in malware detections in APAC compared to Q4 2023. The increased volume mostly comes from the unusually high number of `Heur.RP.Cu2` variants detected in China. Malware detections in the Americas (AMER) dropped by 16 points for a total of 22.5% and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) dropped almost 5 points to 14.7%. In the past, the EMEA and the AMER regions consistently led in malware detections. Over the last few years, especially as we have normalized our statistics to the number of Fireboxes in each region, we have found APAC continues to see increases in malware. We find it very interesting to see that region leading so greatly in malware detections in Q1. It is hard for us to draw any conclusions about the “why” from the qualitative telemetry we have, but we will continue to watch these changes.

### Catching Evasive Malware

Evasive malware is malware created to avoid detection using many techniques, but especially ones that can bypass signature-based detection. We still can detect this malware with the use of APT Blocker and IAV though. These detection systems don’t rely on signatures but on the structure of the file and by detonating the malware in a sandbox to determine what behaviors the potentially suspicious executables do on their destinations systems. We see that malware caught by APT Blocker and IAV tend to use new and advanced techniques to infect systems. Actors who create evasive malware already know how to create more damaging malware. They will use what they know to infect systems for better access and persistence.

Not all Firebox customers buy and use WatchGuard’s Total Security Suite, which is the security service license needed for our more advanced malware detection services. To create the chart below, we only use data from Fireboxes that have all three anti-malware services installed and enabled. That way we can directly compare the percentage of malware detected by our signature-based service and our more advanced and proactive ones. During Q1 2024, 36% of zero-day malware used advanced evasive techniques to bypass our signature-based anti-malware (GAV). We also compare how this ratio changes for malware arriving over encrypted web connections. For this, we must use data from an even smaller subset of Fireboxes that also have TLS decryption and inspection enabled. When it comes to malware arriving over encrypted connections, zero-day malware accounts for 64% of malware, a complete flip of the non-encrypted number.

[A pie chart visually representing the percentage of zero-day malware: 36% for non-encrypted traffic and 64% for encrypted (TLS) traffic.]

While our encrypted zero-day malware percentage seems pretty average, the non-encrypted zero-day malware has dropped lower than we can remember it having been before. We are not sure why this number has decreased so much. Over the many years we have published this report, our zero-day malware percentage has seemed to average 50% or even higher in most quarters. Seeing it drop to 36% feels unusual. That said, as we have mentioned earlier, we believe our encrypted malware findings better represent the state of actual malware trends. Over 90% of web traffic is encrypted, so all the action happens there. The only reason we haven’t switched to only sharing the encrypted view is because just 20% of Firebox administrators take advantage of our powerful HTTPS decryption proxy. We highly recommend administrators use this feature to get the best protection from our anti-malware services. In short, even though our unencrypted zero-day malware number dropped to 36%, we believe the real total is closer to the 64% number we see in encrypted connections.

To summarize, to protect yourself from zero-day malware we recommend you buy and install and configure the Total Security Suite to get the IAV and APT Blocker services to catch some of this evasive malware. We also recommend that if you are not using our TLS decryption capabilities (the HTTPS proxy), you are not even scanning the majority of your web traffic for malware at all. You really must enable decryption in order to get the best return on your anti-malware services. Finally, while our network malware defenses are fantastic, and will prevent the huge majority of malware from even entering your network, things will sometimes get through. That is why you should leverage our full Unified Security Platform architecture, including our powerful Endpoint Protection, Detection and Response (EPDR) to benefit from many additional anti-malware protections for your endpoints as well.

### Individual Malware Sample Analysis

#### `Bash.MiraiB.C9B4EC13`

This widespread sample we found contains a short script that connects to the IP `103[.]14[.]226[.]142` that is associated with the Mirai botnet. This script attempts to download more malware from the IP but we couldn’t get a sample to investigate what it attempted to download. Often these malicious scripts will rely on a “key” to send to the server to receive a response. This key comes from another file that we couldn’t obtain either. We believe we caught an intermediary file in the infection process.

One line in the script caught our eye.

`exec=”your device just got infected to a bootnoot “`

A search of this line in other malware packages found it associated with the Miori botnet – a close variant of the Mirai botnet sharing much of the same code. We know the Miori botnet from the TP-Link Archer exploit CVE-2023-1389. This command injection vulnerability can take control of the TP-Link device and add it to the botnet.

#### GoldenSpy and GoldenHelper

We found a few different variants of related malware campaigns mostly coming from devices in China. GoldenSpy includes `Jaik.210739` later called `Trojan.Heur.RP.Cu2` and its variants. Based on our research, this looks like a continuation of issues that a seemingly legitimate Chinese tax program had when it was caught spying on its users. To cover up its malicious intent, GoldenHelper attempts an update to secretly remove its spyware. You can read more about this already researched malware campaign [here](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/j/goldenhelper-a-new-variant-of-goldenspy-malware.html).

To hide in plain sight, the malware stops and deletes files that have similar names as the Windows audio service. Its own filename, `audiosrv2.exe`, closely resembles the legitimate Windows audio service file, `audiosrv.exe`. It runs the command below to stop the malware service:

`taskkill /f /im audiosrv2.exe`

The only explanation we can think of for naming itself similarly to a legitimate Windows file is in hope of hiding its malicious purpose.

We also saw that these files were deleted when running in a sandbox.

`C:\Windows\SysWOW64\audiosrv2.exe`

`C:\Windows\System32\audiosrv2.exe`

We don’t see much happening after this, likely because it doesn’t find the files it wants to modify. With the help of our team, we pulled some more strings out of the sample. One string, `skfpd.exe`, looks similar to the four-letter naming convention in GoldenHelper `skpc.dll`.
