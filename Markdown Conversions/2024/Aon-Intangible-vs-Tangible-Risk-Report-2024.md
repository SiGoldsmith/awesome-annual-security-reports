Artificial Intelligence Affects Cyber and IP Value and Risk

A. Evolution of Intangible Risks 

Generative artificial intelligence and cybersecurity are the top CEO concerns according to a 2024 survey1\. While the 
European Union’s new artificial intelligence law2 was designed to bridge the gap between concerned intellectual 
property creators and AI providers, the measure may actually embolden copyright holders to go to court.3 Additional 
2024 intangible assets\-related studies suggested the following:

 ● Misinformation and disinformation driven by artificial 
intelligence (“AI”) pose the most severe global risks in 
the next two years.4 

 ○ Providers of AI products/solutions range from some 
of the largest technology leaders in the world5 to 
innovative AI assistant start\-ups6

 ○ We are at the very early stages of a highly complex 
multi\-decade AI transformation where the upside 
rewards and downside perils are uncertain7

 ○ From nonbinding guidelines to restrictions, 

AI regulation varies amongst nations8 

 ● Intellectual Property (“IP”) is one of the greatest 

 ● Cyber incidents are the biggest threats facing 

sources of value creation in the corporate world, but 
it is also one of the most underutilized, which creates 
unintended enterprise level risks9 

 ○ AI affects IP risk and uncertainty10 

organizations13 

 ○ Businesses are 67% more likely to experience a 

cyber incident than a physical theft and almost five 
times as likely to have a cyber attack as a fire.14

Insurance mandates superior risk management practices 
and facilitates lower Total Cost of Risk17 for today’s 
evolving intangible assets. Increased safety resilience in 
artificial intelligence, cyber\-related products/services, 
intellectual property and evolving technology digital 
assets/services might be rewarded with:

 ● Superior insurance coverage and lower premium 
options, which protects organizations’ balance 
sheets against catastrophic losses;

 ● Third party, independent underwriters’ review 

(and suggestions for improvements) of intangible 
asset providers’ and users’ risk management;

 ● A stamp of insurance carrier risk management 

verification, which differentiates organizations to 
meet customer contract requirements and satisfy 
regulatory obligations; and

 ● Risk capital18 and human capital19 service providers

1IntroductionC. Better Decisions for Intangible Asset Investment 

and Protection

The most valuable organizations make risk management 
cost\-benefit decisions predicated upon quantifiable, 
objective, fact\-based data. The return on intangible 
assets investment is unclear24\. The estimated ROI 
magnitude range is enormous25\. A February 2024 
report states that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman seeks to 
raise up to $7 trillion, which had many tech\-industry 
observers raising eyebrows. The amount easily exceeds 
the market cap of any company—including Microsoft, 
which recently hit $3\.1 trillion and surged past Apple as 
America’s most valuable company.26 

Similarly, the range of estimates regarding frequency 
and severity of potential losses from intangible assets 
is enormous27\. The insurance industry typically builds 
actuarial loss models based on decades of data.28 

However, due to the dynamic and fluid nature of 
intangible assets, we will never have decades worth 
of static intangible assets and risks data. Therefore, 
“retain risk” versus “transfer risk” decisions require fresh 
thinking.29 Compliance with accepted industry standards 
should be the minimum baseline.30

In this report, we compare the relative:

 ● Value of certain tangible31 compared to certain 

intangible assets32

 ● Quantification of potential losses from tangible 

compared to intangible assets

 ● Insurance protection of tangible compared to 

intangible assets

Large, complex, global organizations 
that execute a data and analytics\-based 
enterprise risk management process are 
better positioned to maximize value and 
mitigate risks from their intangible assets.

29 The most calamitous failures of prediction usually have a lot in common. We focus 
on those signals that tell a story about the world as we would like it to be, not how 
it really is. We ignore the risks that are hardest to measure, even when they pose 
the greatest threats to our well\-being. We make approximations and assumptions 
about the world that are much cruder than we realize. We abhor uncertainty, even 
when it is an irreducible part of the problem we are trying to solve.” Silver, Nate.

transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or together with 
a related contract; or arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of 
whether those rights are transferable or separable from the entity or from other 
rights and obligations.

1IntroductionHow can organizations make better decisions regarding 
allocation of their finite resources to protect against 
tangible and intangible perils? At its most basic, 
insurance is a financial instrument — a way to manage 
the cost of future risk. It’s pretty simple. On the one 
hand, you can self\-insure risk, holding onto it yourself 
and bearing the full cost of a loss (unless you have 
transferred it contractually in an indemnity agreement 
with a counterparty). Or you can pay an insurance 
company a premium to take some or all of that risk from 
you. The biggest challenges to address intangible assets 
risks are identification/quantification of the exposures 
and then taking a different, proactive mindset to 
mitigate such risks. 

For example, there are recent studies that set forth 
the relative ROI of various cyber risk management 
mechanisms. Allocating cyber resiliency resources 
based on their relative increase/decrease effect on 
expected losses is a better decision\-making mindset. 
The following chart sets forth factors that decrease/
increase the total cost of a data breach on an average 
relative basis.33

1IntroductionGiven the intersection of tangible and intangible assets 
in many instances with the advent of the Internet of 
Things/5G,34 growth of AI robotics, metaverse/Web 3\.0,35 
virtual reality gaming, quantum computing, blockchain,36 
etc. it is difficult to separate the actuarial modelling of 
intangible and tangible risks – but it is necessary and 
useful. For instance, the tangible assets of Property, 
Plant \& Equipment (despite lower relative value) are 
insured three times greater (60 percent vs 19 percent) 
than information assets.37

Cyberattacks, especially ransomware38 are surging39 
despite increased cyber security.40 Yet, cyber insurance 
pricing continues to decrease due to insurance carrier 
competition. Something has got to give.

1Introduction 
Generative AI, which creates material such as images, 
music and text, results in perils such as intellectual 
property infringement,41 hallucinations,42 security/
privacy breaches43 and bias44 garnering most of the 
litigation news. However, some developing AI products, 
such as AI robots, face perils that are different from 
content misinformation, such as mistakes that can lead 
to bodily injury and/or tangible property damage. AI 
raises particular risk transfer challenges because AI 
exposures may implicate potential losses that do not fit 
neatly in to existing insurance buckets.45 Courts may 
struggle to extend or limit existing tort/case, statutory 
and contract law with respect to AI. Where there are 
multiple AI providers, users, vendors, distributors, 
customers and others in the supply chain,46 allocation 
of liability looms large.

Furthermore, most traditional insurance policies do not 
explicitly address AI\-related risks. Insureds should clarify 
the scope of coverage and potential exclusions. The 
“silent cyber” cases, whereby historical property, crime, 
and general liability policies did not affirmatively “cover” 
or “exclude” cyber perils, resulted in extensive litigation 
between insurance companies and insureds. 

Insurance policies address artificial intelligence perils in 
one of three ways:

 ● Affirmative coverage47

 ● Specific exclusions48

 ● Silent,49 which creates ambiguity50

With all that’s going on in the 
economy, whether its artificial 
intelligence, whether it’s intellectual 
property, whether it’s cyber 
dependency, or regulatory change 
related to intangible assets, our ability 
to continue to innovate, to create 
new products to bring new services 
to our clients, effectively stay one 
step ahead of where the economy 
and where these issues are going, 
is vital to us being able to provide 
advice and products to make better 
decisions for their businesses.

1IntroductionRisk management typically considers frequency and 
severity of perils. With respect to intangible assets 
(especially artificial intelligence and cyber), we should 
add velocity of evolving risk profiles. Organizations 
must proactively address intangible risks through 
tailored insurance policies that align with their unique 
circumstances.51 As the intangible assets landscape 
continues to evolve, a collaborative effort between 
stakeholders,52 led by legal counsel, risk management, 
finance/treasury, business units, information technology, 
and compliance \- and mandated by management \- 
is crucial to help ensure that the potential perils of 
intangible assets are effectively managed and mitigated.

Interestingly, the S\&P companies that cited “AI” on Q4 
2023 earnings calls have seen a better average stock 
price performance over the past 12 months compared to 
the S\&P 500 companies that did not.53

51 Note that procuring a robust cyber insurance program could be a consideration 
in determining whether a cyber incident is “material” for purposes of the new 
SEC four day mandatory disclosure rule (Aon \| Financial Services Group \- SEC 
Sharpens Focus on Cybersecurity with New Disclosure Rule). For instance, assume 
that two organizations in the same industry, geography and revenue band suffer an 
identical cyber incident \= $25 million in potential losses each. Company “A” has a 
$50 million limits cyber insurance program and Company “B” declined to purchase 
cyber insurance due to budget cuts (and Company “B” does not have any other 
insurance policy that addresses the loss). There is an argument that Company 
“A” may not be required to disclose the cyber incident as “material” (because it is 
protected against the loss by its cyber insurance policy) while Company “B” not 
only has to disclose the incident within 4 days, but will also suffer the uninsured 
$25 million hit to its balance sheet. (Why Private Companies Should Pay Attention 
to the SEC’s New Cybersecurity Disclosure Rules (cosecure.com)

1IntroductionA High\-level Overview of the Consolidated Global Findings

Most organizations (67 percent of respondents) use 
or intend to use (19 percent) artificial intelligence (AI) 
products or services. There is growing interest in 
adopting AI to strengthen their organizations’ security 
posture. According to a recent Ponemon Institute study, 
AI improves IT security staff’s productivity and the ability 
to detect previously undetectable threats.54 Sixty\-four 
percent of respondents say their organizations use or 
plan to use (21 percent) cryptocurrency or non\-fungible 
token assets.

The Valuation of PP\&E, Information Assets and Probable 
Maximum Loss (PML)

The value of Information Assets Probable Maximum 
Loss (“PML”)55 is higher than PP\&E. Organizations 
estimate the average PML resulting from stolen or 
destroyed information at approximately $1,155 million. 
In contrast, the average value of the largest loss that 
could result from damage or total destruction of PP\&E 
is approximately $846 million. Business disruption has 
a greater impact on information assets ($324 million)56 
than on PP\&E ($144 million). 

The value of information assets is higher than tangible 
asset values. The average total value of information 
assets is $1,239 million, which is slightly higher thanthe 
average total value of PP\&E, which is approximately 
$1,088 million for the organizations represented in this 
research. 

The likelihood of a loss is higher for information assets 
than for PP\&E. Organizations estimate the likelihood 
that they will sustain a loss relating to information 
assets totaling no more than 50 percent of PML over the 
next 12 months at 5 percent and 100 percent of PML 
at 3 percent. The likelihood of a loss relating to PP\&E 
totaling no more than 50 percent of PML over the next 
12 months is an average of 2 percent and at 100 percent 
of PML it is 0\.55 percent.

Insurance coverage is higher for tangible assets (PP\&E) 
than for intangible assets (information assets). On 
average, approximately 60 percent of PP\&E assets are 
covered by insurance and approximately 32 percent 
of PP\&E are self\-insured. While the likelihood of a loss 
is higher for information assets than for PP\&E, only 

“

an average of 19 percent of information assets are 
covered by insurance, while self\-insurance is higher for 
information assets at 58 percent.

Thirty percent of respondents believe no disclosure 
of a material loss to information assets not covered by 
insurance is required. This is a stunning data point given 
that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s 
new Form 8\-K rules for reporting material cybersecurity 
incidents took effect (other than for smaller reporting 
companies) December 18, 2024\.57 In contrast, only 
14 percent of respondents believe no disclosure of a 
material loss to PP\&E assets not covered by insurance 
is required. 

Forty\-two percent of respondents say their organizations 
would disclose a material loss to information assets and 
PP\&E in a footnote in the financial statements. Twenty\-
one percent of respondents would disclose a material 
loss to PP\&E as a contingent liability on the balance 
sheet (FASB 5\) and only 13 percent would disclose 
a material loss to information assets as a contingent 
liability on the balance sheet.

55 Probable Maximum Loss (PML) is defined as the value of the largest loss that could result from a disaster, assuming the normal functioning of passive protective features 

(i.e., firewalls, nonflammable materials, etc.) and proper functioning of most (perhaps not all) active suppression systems (i.e., sprinklers). 

56 While the survey results suggest Probable Maximum Loss at approximately $324 million, a growing number of organizations are using Risk Decision Platform Analysis and Cyber 

Modeling to suggest potential losses in excess of $500 million to over $1 billion and are seeking cyber insurance limit premium quotes and policy terms for such amounts.

1Introduction 
Cyber Risk Exposure Increases 

Fifty\-six percent of organizations had a material 58 or 
significantly disruptive security exploit or data breach 
one or more times in the past 24 months. The average 
total financial impact of these incidents was $5 million.59 
Sixty\-six percent of these respondents say the incident 
increased their company’s concerns over cyber liability. 

Data breaches and security exploitations caused by 
negligence or mistakes increases significantly. The 
most frequent type of incident was one that was caused 
by negligence or mistakes that resulted in the loss 
of business confidential information (53 percent of 
respondents). Fifty percent of respondents say it was a 
cyberattack that caused a disruption to business and IT 
operations. Forty\-seven percent of respondents say a 
system or business process failure caused disruption to 
business operations.

More organizations are becoming aware of the economic 
and legal consequences from an international data 
breach or security exploit. Eighty\-nine percent of 
respondents are either fully (41 percent) or somewhat 
aware (48 percent) of the consequences that could result 
from a data breach or security exploit in other countries 
in which their company operates. Only 11 percent of 
respondents say they are not aware of the consequences, 
a significant decline from 20 percent in 2017\.60

The use of third parties to assess cyber risk has 
declined. To determine the cyber risk to their company, 
27 percent of respondents say the company hired a third 
party to conduct an assessment or audit, a decrease 
from 33 percent. However, formal internal assessments 
are slowly increasing (from 15 percent in 2015 to 25 
percent of respondents this year). Twenty\-two percent 
of respondents say their organizations did an informal 
(ad hoc) internal assessment. Only 18 percent of 
respondents say it was based on intuition or gut feel.

Organizations’ exposure to cyber risk is increasing. 
While organizations are predicting that their cyber risk 
exposure will increase, 32 percent of respondents say 
there is no plan to purchase standalone cyber insurance. 
Sixty\-nine percent of respondents believe their company’s 
exposure to cyber risk will increase and 21 percent of 
respondents say it will stay the same. Only 10 percent 
of respondents expect it to actually decrease.

Only 44 percent of respondents are prepared for a 
cyber or IP “black swan”. A black swan is an event that 
is an “outlier” as it lies outside the realm of regular 
expectations. According to the research, 44 percent of 
respondents say ab external cyber and/or intellectual 
property incident can become a Black Swan for the firm.61

15

58 In the context of this study, the term “materiality” takes into consideration monies expended for first\-party losses, potential third\-party liabilities, value of lost time, litigation costs, 

reputation damages and revenue losses. This term is broader than “materiality” as defined by GAAP and SEC requirements.

59 This included all costs, including out\-of\-pocket expenditures such as consultant and legal fees, indirect business costs such as productivity losses, diminished revenues, legal 

actions, customer turnover and reputational damages.

1IntroductionFew cyber insurance policies cover ransomware 
payments and costs to recover from the attack. 
The top three costs are forensics and investigative 
costs, replacement of lost or damaged equipment and 
notification costs to data breach victims, 68 percent, 
62 percent and 59 percent of respondents respectively). 
Only 34 percent of respondents say their insurance 
reimburse costs related to ransomware.

The Use of Cyber Insurance to Mitigate the Financial 
Consequences of Data Breaches and Security Exploits.62

Cyber liability is a top 10 business risk. However, 
70 percent of respondents say their organizations are 
still not purchasing standalone cyber insurance coverage. 
The average limit for those organizations purchasing 
cyber insurance is $17 million.

More than half of respondents (53 percent) say it was 
error and negligence that was the root cause of their 
data breach or security exploit, yet only 33 percent of 
respondents say their insurance covers these types 
of incidents. Seventy\-eight percent of respondents 
say it covers external attacks by cyber criminals and 
76 percent of respondents say it was malicious or 
criminal insiders.

1IntroductionVulnerability of IP Assets

As a complement to a cyber risk policy, few 
organizations have a trade secret theft insurance policy 
and/or an intellectual property liability policy. 
Only 35 percent of respondents say they have a trade 
secret theft insurance policy and a similar percentage 
of respondents (34 percent) have an intellectual 
property liability policy. 

Most organizations’ insurance does not cover all 
consequences of an IP event. Only 32 percent of 
respondents say it covers an allegation that their 
company is infringing third\-party IP rights. Thirty\-six 
percent of respondents report that their policy covers a 
challenge to their company’s IP assets while 33 percent 
of respondents say it covers third\-party infringement 
of their company’s IP assets. One\-third of respondents 
(33 percent) say the policy does not cover IP events.63

The percentage of respondents who say their 
organizations have a strategy to manage IP risks 
increases. Sixty\-one percent of respondents say their 
enterprise risk management activities include risks 
to their IP, a significant increase from 53 percent of 
respondents in 2022\.

IP security exploits involving patents has increased 
significantly. In the past two years, 50 percent of 
respondents say their company experienced a 
material IP event.64 The IP material event can be best 
described as an infringement of company rights 
(37 percent of respondents), challenge to company 
rights (33 percent of respondents) or an allegation of 
an organization’s infringement of third\-party rights 
(30 percent of respondents).

Most of these incidents involved trade secrets 
(36 percent of respondents). However, exploits 
involving patent rights increased from 25 percent of 
respondents to 32 percent of respondents. 
Organizations represented in this research estimate 
that the average total value of their IP assets such as 
trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and 
know\-how is $600 million. An average of 47 percent 
of organizations’ total assets are IP assets.

While most organizations do not have specific IP 
insurance policies, there is significant interest in 
purchasing them. Sixty\-four percent of respondents 
are very interested or interested in purchasing a trade 
secret insurance policy and 62 percent say their 
organizations would purchase an intellectual property 
liability policy.

17

63 A detailed review of insurance policies indicates that IP coverage is much lower than survey responses reflect – especially for patent infringement and trade secrets theft, which 

detailed reviews show less than 5% of organizations have insurance coverage for trade secrets or patents.

64 “IP event” includes “challenge to company rights,” “infringement of company rights,” and “allegation of company infringement of third\-party rights” pursuant to Question 25c in the 

Appendix hereto.

The Valuation of Property, Plant and Equipment (PP\&E) 
Information Assets and Probable Maximum Loss

This report features the consolidated findings of all 
regions in this research. Separate reports will be created 
for the North America, EMEA, Asia\-Pac and LATAM 
regions. The complete global consolidated audited 
findings are presented in the Appendix of this report.

All respondents are familiar with the cyber risks facing 
their company. In the context of this research, cyber risk 
means any risk of financial loss, disruption or damage 
to the reputation of an organization from some sort of 
failure of its information technology systems.66 We have 
organized the report according to the following topics:

 ● The Valuation of Property, Plant and Equipment 

(PP\&E), Information Assets and Probable Maximum 
Loss (PML)

 ● Cyber Risk Exposures Increase

 ● The Use of Cyber Insurance to Mitigate the 

Financial Consequences of Data Breaches and 
Security Exploits

 ● The Vulnerability of IP Assets

The Valuation of Property, Plant and Equipment (PP\&E), 
Information Assets and Probable Maximum Loss (PML)

Organizations continue to value information assets 
slightly higher than they do PP\&E. According to Figure 1, 
on average, the total value of PP\&E, including all fixed 
assets plus SCADA and industrial control systems is 

approximately $1,088 million for the organizations 
represented in this research. The average total value 
of information assets, which includes customer records, 
employee records, financial reports, analytical data, 
source code, models, methods and other intellectual 
properties, is slightly higher, at $1,239 million.

2Key FindingsThe value of PML is higher for information assets than 
for PP\&E. Organizations estimate the average PML 
resulting from the theft or destruction of information 
assets at approximately $1,155 million, according 
to Figure 2\. This assumes the normal functioning of 
passive protective cybersecurity solutions such as 
perimeter controls, data loss prevention tools, data 
encryption, identity and access management systems 
and more. 

In contrast, the value of the largest loss that could result 
from damage or total destruction of PP\&E is, on average, 
approximately $846 million. This also assumes the 
normal functioning of passive protective features such as 
firewalls, nonflammable materials, proper functioning of 
active suppression systems, fire sprinklers, raised flooring 
and more.

2Key FindingsThe impact of business disruption to information asset 
losses is more significant than the impact to PP\&E. 
According to Figure 3, business disruption has a greater 
impact on information assets ($324 million)67 than on 
PP\&E ($144 million).

67 While the survey results suggest Probably Maximum Loss in the neighborhood of 
$324 million, a growing number of organizations are using Risk Decision Platform 
Analysis and Cyber Modeling to suggest potential losses in excess of $500 million 
to over $1 billion and seek cyber insurance limit premium quotes and policy terms 
for such amounts.

2Key FindingsThe likelihood of a loss is higher for information assets 
than for PP\&E. Organizations estimate the likelihood 
that they will sustain a loss relating to information assets 
totaling no more than 50 percent of PML over the next 
12 months at 5 percent and 100 percent of PML at 
3 percent, as shown in Figure 4\. The likelihood of a loss 
relating to PP\&E totaling no more than 50 percent of 
PML over the next 12 months is an average of 2 percent 
and at 100 percent of PML it is 0\.55 percent.

2Key FindingsThere is a significant difference between the insurance 
coverage of PP\&E and information assets. On average, 
approximately 60 percent of PP\&E assets are covered 
by insurance and approximately 32 percent of PP\&E 
assets are self\-insured (Figure 5\). Only an average of 
19 percent of information assets are covered by 
insurance. Self\-insurance is higher for information 
assets at 58 percent.

a material loss to information assets not covered by 
insurance is required. In contrast, only 14 percent of 
respondents say no disclosure is necessary for a 
material loss to PP\&E assets not covered by insurance 
is required. Figure 6 focuses on how organizations 
would disclose a material loss. Forty\-two percent of 
respondents say their company would disclose a material 
loss to PP\&E and information assets not covered by 
insurance in the footnotes of its financial statements. 

Twenty\-one percent of respondents say their 
organizations would disclose a material loss to PP\&E 
as a contingent liability on the balance sheet (FASB 5\). 
Thirteen percent of respondents say an information 
loss would be reported as a contingent liability.

2Key FindingsCyber Risk Exposures Increase

Fifty\-six percent of respondents say their organizations 
had a material or significantly disruptive security exploit 
or data breach one or more times in the past 24 months. 
The average total financial impact of these incidents 
was $5 million. According to Figure 7, 66 percent of 
these respondents say the incident increased their 
company’s concerns over cyber liability.

2Key FindingsData breaches and security exploits caused by negligence 
or mistakes increases significantly. Figure 9 lists the 
security incidents that 56 percent of the organizations 
in this research had. The most frequent type of incident 
was one that was caused by negligence or mistakes that 
resulted in the loss of business confidential information 
(53 percent of respondents). 

Fifty percent of respondents say it was a cyber attack that 
caused a disruption to business and IT operations. Forty\-
seven percent of respondents say a system or business 
process failure caused disruption to business operations.

2Key FindingsThe use of third parties to assess cyber risk has declined. 
According to Figure 10, to determine the cyber risk 
to their company, 27 percent of respondents say the 
company hired a third party to conduct an assessment

increasing (25 percent of respondents). Twenty\-two 
percent of respondents say their organizations did an 
informal (ad hoc) internal assessment. Only 18 percent 
of respondents say it was based on intuition or gut feel.

2Key FindingsMore organizations are becoming aware of the economic 
and legal consequences from an international data 
breach or security exploit. As revealed in Figure 11, 
89 percent of respondents are either fully (41 percent) 
or somewhat aware (48 percent) of the consequences 
that could result from a data breach or security 
exploit in other countries in which their company 
operates. Only 11 percent of respondents say they are 
not aware of the consequences, a significant decline 
from 20 percent in 2017\.

2Key FindingsOrganizations’ exposure to cyber risk is increasing. 
While organizations are predicting that their cyber 
risk exposure will increase, 32 percent of respondents 
say there is no plan to purchase standalone cyber 
insurance. As the data in Figure 12 show, 69 percent of 
respondents believe their company’s exposure to cyber 
risk will increase and 21 percent of respondents say 
it will stay the same. Only 10 percent of respondents 
expect it to actually decrease.

2Key FindingsMost organizations are postponing the purchase of 
a standalone cyber insurance. Thirty\-two percent of 
respondents say their organizations have no plans 
to purchase a standalone cyber insurance policy. 
Only 18 percent of respondents say their company will 
purchase standalone cyber insurance policy in the 
next 12 months. Half of respondents (50 percent) 
say they will purchase a standalone cyber insurance 
policy in the next 24 months (28 percent) or more 
than 24 months (22 percent). 

According to Figure 13, the main reasons for not 
purchasing a standalone cyber security insurance 
policy are: coverage is inadequate based on their 
exposure (38 percent of respondents), premiums are 
too expensive (37 percent of respondents) and there 
are too many exclusions, restrictions and uninsurable 
risks (29 percent of respondents).

2Key FindingsMost organizations are not preparing for a Black Swan 
event as part of their enterprise risk management 
approach, although 44 percent of respondents say 
their organizations had an external cyber or IP incident 
that became such an event. A Black Swan is an event 
that is an “outlier” as it lies outside the realm of regular 
expectations.68 As shown in Figure 14, while 44 percent 
of respondents say an external cyber and intellectual 
property incident has become a Black Swan event for 
their organizations, only 44 percent of respondents say 
preparation for such an event is part of their enterprise 
risk management approach.69

68 A black swan is an unpredictable event that is beyond what is normally expected 
of a situation and has potentially severe consequences, such as the COVID\-19 
pandemic. Black swan events are characterized by their extreme rarity, their severe 
impact, and the widespread insistence they were obvious in hindsight.

69 Due to their severe impact, “black swans” should be considered by the board of 
directors. Is cyber risk a D\&O risk? (ethicalboardroom.com). While data on gray 
swan events are lacking, preparation is still possible to anticipate and combat 
these relatively rare but significantly risky events. Black and Grey Swans: 5 Ways

2Key FindingsThe Use of Cyber Insurance to Mitigate the Financial 
Consequences of Data Breaches and Security Exploits

Only 30 percent of respondents say their organizations 
have cyber insurance included within a Technology 
Errors or Omission or similar policy, not including 
Property, General Liability or Crime policy and 
responded to the questions in this section.

Since 2017, fewer organizations believe their cyber 
insurance coverage is sufficient. Despite the extent 
of cyber risk, which exceeds that of PP\&E risk, only 
30 percent of respondents say their organizations 
currently have cyber insurance coverage with an 
average limit of $17 million. 

As Figure 15 reveals, 56 percent of these respondents 
believe their insurance is sufficient with respect to 
coverage terms and conditions, exclusions, retentions, 
limits and insurance carrier financial security, 
a significant decline from 63 percent in 2017\.70

70 The Future of Insurance to Address Cyber Perils. Insurance Thought Leadership.

2Key FindingsMore than half of respondents (53 percent) say it was 
error and negligence that was the root cause of their 
data breach or security exploit, yet only 33 percent of 
respondents say their insurance covers these types 
of incidents. Figure 16 lists the types of incidents 
organizations’ insurance covers. As shown, 78 percent 
of respondents say it covers external attacks by cyber 
criminals and 76 percent of respondents covers was 
malicious or criminal insiders. 

Risk capital providers must bring the 
breadth of their expertise, relationships 
and analytics to unlock traditional and 
alternative capital, which is accessed 
regardless of market, geography or 
financial instrument to create greater 
value and help organizations grow.

2Key FindingsFew cyber insurance providers are covering ransomware 
payments and costs to recover from the attack. Figure 18 
lists the various reimbursements and services insurance 
organizations offer. The top three are forensics and 
investigative costs, replacement of lost or damaged 
equipment and notification costs to data breach victims, 
68 percent, 62 percent and 59 percent of respondents 
respectively). Thirty\-four percent of respondents say 
their insurance reimburse costs related to ransomware.

2Key FindingsAccess to forensic, legal and regulatory experts are 
other services provided. According to Figure 19, the 
primary services provided by the insurer are access 
to cyber security forensic experts and legal and 
regulatory experts (both 81 percent of respondents, 
respectively). This is followed by assistance in the 
remediation of the incident (55 percent of respondents) 
and access to specialized technologies and tools 
(52 percent of respondents).

2Key FindingsThe Vulnerability of IP Assets

The IP events that existing insurance policies cover. 
According to Figure 20, of the 67 percent of 
respondents with cyber insurance that have policies 
covering IP events, 36 percent of respondents say 
their organizations’ existing insurance policy covers a 
challenge to their IP assets, 33 percent say it covers 
third\-party infringement of their IP assets and 31 percent 
of respondents say it covers an allegation that their 
company is infringing third\-party IP rights.71

71 Evolution of Insurance Coverage for Intellectual Property Litigation 

Policyholders and coverage practitioners should be aware of changes 
in available coverage.

2Key FindingsDespite the potential risk, few organizations have a 
trade secret theft insurance policy and/or an intellectual 
property liability policy. As shown in Figure 21, only 
35 percent of respondents say they have a trade secret 
theft insurance policy and a similar percentage of 
respondents (34 percent) have an intellectual property 
liability policy.72

72 A detailed review of insurance policies indicates that IP coverage is included in 

existing policies at a much lower rate than survey responses reflect – especially for 
patent infringement and trade secrets theft, which detailed reviews show less than 
5% of organizations have insurance coverage for trade secrets or patents.

2Key FindingsWhile most organizations do not have specific IP insurance 
policies, there is significant interest in purchasing them. 
According to Figure 22, 64 percent of respondents 
are very interested or interested in purchasing a trade 
secret insurance policy and 62 percent say their 
organizations would purchase an intellectual property 
liability policy.

2Key FindingsCyber liability and IP risks rank in the top 10 of all 
business risks facing organizations. According to 
Figure 23, 56 percent of respondents consider cyber 
risk as the number one or two business risk (21 percent 
of respondents) and among the top five (35 percent 
of respondents). Similarly, 53 percent of respondents 
rate the risk to their company’s intellectual property (IP) 
among the top 5 off all business risks (19 percent \+ 
34 percent).

Even though calculating the frequency and severity 
of intangible asset risks compared to intangible asset 
value relative to other organization assets is not a 
perfectly scientific mathematical exercise, we cannot 
afford to ignore the risks that are hardest to measure 
– especially when they may pose the greatest threats 
to our organizations. “The most calamitous failures 
of prediction usually have a lot in common. We focus 
on those signals that tell a story about the world as 
we would like it to be, not how it really is. We ignore 
the risks that are hardest to measure, even when they 
pose the greatest threats to our well\-being. We make 
approximations and assumptions about the world that 
are much cruder than we realize. We abhor uncertainty, 
even when it is an irreducible part of the problem we are 
trying to solve.”73

2Key FindingsThe percentage of respondents who say their 
organizations have a strategy to manage risks to IP 
increased. Organizations represented in this research 
estimate that the average total value of their IP 
assets such as trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade 
secrets and know\-how is $600 million. An average of 
47 percent of organizations’ total assets are IP assets.

As shown in Figure 24, 61 percent of respondents say 
their enterprise risk management activities include 
risks to their IP, a significant increase from 2022\.

3Appendix 1\. Methods \& CaveatsCaveats

There are inherent limitations to survey research that need 
to be carefully considered before drawing inferences 
from findings. The following items are specific limitations 
that are germane to most web\-based surveys.

Non\-response bias: The current findings are based 
on a sample of survey returns. We sent surveys to 
a representative sample of individuals, resulting 
in a large number of usable returned responses. 
Despite non\-response tests, it is always possible that 
individuals who did not participate are substantially 
different in terms of underlying beliefs from those who 
completed the instrument. 

Sampling frame bias: The accuracy is based on 
contact information and the degree to which the list is 
representative of individuals who are involved in their 
company’s’ cyber and enterprise risk management. 
We also acknowledge that the results may be biased 
by external events such as media coverage. We also 
acknowledge bias caused by compensating subjects to 
complete this research within a specified time period. 

Self\-reported results: The quality of survey research 
is based on the integrity of confidential responses 
received from subjects. While certain checks and 
balances can be incorporated into the survey process, 
there is always the possibility that a subject did not 
provide accurate responses.
