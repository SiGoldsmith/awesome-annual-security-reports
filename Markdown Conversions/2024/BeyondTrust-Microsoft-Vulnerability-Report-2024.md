Data Highlights

Key Findings



After hitting an all\-time high in 
the number of reported 
Microsoft vulnerabilities in 2022, 
total reported vulnerabilities 
have slightly receded. 



Looking at the larger trend, the 
number of Microsoft 
vulnerabilities has plateaued 
since 2020\.

Total vulnerabilities continue their 4\-year 
holding pattern near their highest\-ever numbers.
While dropping slightly (by 5%) from 1,292 to 1,228 in 
2023, total vulnerabilities have held firm near their all\-
time highs, remaining between 1,200 and 1,300 for the 
past four years (since 2020\).


Elevation of Privilege vulnerability category 
continues to dominate. 
Continuing the trend in 
post\-pandemic years, Elevation of Privilege accounted 
for 40% (490\) of the total vulnerabilities in 2023\.


The total number of critical vulnerabilities 
continues its downward trend, but slowly. 
Critical vulnerabilities dropped by 6% to 84 in 2023 
(5 less than 2022\).

Data Highlights

 After Microsoft Azure \& Dynamics 365 vulnerabilities skyrocketed in 2022, they almost 

halved in 2023 – down from 114 to 63

 Microsoft Edge experienced 249 vulnerabilities in 2023, only one of which was critical

 There were 522 Windows vulnerabilities in 2023, 55 of which were critical

 Microsoft Office experienced 62 vulnerabilities in 2023

 Windows Server category had 558 vulnerabilities in 2023, 57 of which were critical

 Denial of Service vulnerabilities climbed 51% to hit a record high of 109 in 2023, with 

Spoofing demonstrating a dramatic 190% increase, from 31 to 90\.

5\-Year Trend

Total number of 
vulnerabilities 
have plateaued, 
remaining between 
1,200 and 1,300 for 
the past four years.

Following the dramatic increase of Microsoft vulnerabilities in 2020, we have observed the total 
number of vulnerabilities plateauing over the past four years, with the range of fluctuations 
staying within a 7% window. 



Total vulnerabilities hit 1,228 in 2023, which represents a 5% decrease over the previous year, 
after hitting an all\-time\-high of 1,292 in 2022\.

2024 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 

Critical vulnerabilities continued 
their downward trend in 2023, but 
the pace has slowed.

Similarly, critical vulnerabilities have remained steady, dipping slightly from 89 in 2022 to 84 in 
2023\. In terms of both total and critical vulnerabilities, this makes the past two years some of the 
most consistent we have seen since this report’s debut eleven years ago, with no major swings 
in the core data.



Looking at the distribution of critical vulnerabilities year over year, we observe a consistent 
downward trend. Windows Desktop and Server categories have both remained the main source 
of critical vulnerabilities through 2023\. Given that they share a similar codebase, which 
represents a progressive evolution of the Windows NT Kernel, this is not a surprise.



As we discussed in last year’s report, there are areas of Windows operating systems with \~20\-
year\-old, often long\-forgotten code that can come back to haunt us—even on the latest versions 
of Windows. Over time, these risks have been steadily decreasing as the longtail of services and 
features have been refreshed. This plays a part in why we are seeing stability in the data today, 
which we will cover in greater depth below.

A major source of risk for organizations everywhere, 
critical vulnerabilities, when exploited, have the potential 
to result in high\-impact security events. These are the 
vulnerabilities that keep IT admins awake at night.

2024 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 

What does stable 
vulnerabilities data tell us?

Stable vulnerabilities data is a strong indicator that 
overall long\-term security efforts are paying off.

As we discussed in previous reports, an absence of sharp increases, as well as consistently decreasing 
numbers, are good indicators that many of Microsoft’s longer\-term security efforts are paying off.



Legacy products, many of which were first developed before Microsoft introduced their Security 
Development Lifecycle in 2004, have come to End\-of\-Life (EOL), and newer, more secure operating 
systems and products have taken their place. Cloud technologies have matured, and those security 
investments have paid off.



Even looking back just three years, we see a starkly different picture. In 2020, critical vulnerability numbers 
were 133% higher than they were in 2023\. While this year’s data hasn’t revealed as big a decrease in critical 
vulnerabilities as it has in previous years, the steady downward trend continues. This is a reassuring 
finding—especially for the IT practitioners who live and breathe the security of their Microsoft systems.

Understanding Microsoft 
Critical Vulnerabilities

The total number of vulnerabilities are an important indicator of an 
environment’s health, but vulnerabilities are not created equal.



Some vulnerabilities may pose mostly theoretical risk (low likelihood 
and low impact) if they are exploited. On the opposite side of the 
spectrum, other vulnerabilities have high likelihoods of exploitation, 
and their exploitation may result in a highly negative impact to the 
affected organization(s).



Measuring a vulnerability’s level of impact relates to its impact on 
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data within a system 
or organization. The most severe vulnerabilities will impact all three 
of these basic tenets of information security.



Vulnerabilities categorized as ‘critical’ are those with characteristics 
that make their exploitation a potentially high\-impact security 
event. The way Microsoft classifies the severity rating for a 
vulnerability is distinct from the likelihood of exploitation. 



However, the likelihood of exploitation is far more dynamic because 
attackers are more likely to exploit a known vulnerability.

Exploitation of ‘critical’ 
vulnerabilities will:



Likely result in total compromise 
of a device or infrastructure.



Have fewer prerequisites. 
Usually, the attack would not 
require any special access, 
privileges, or advanced 
knowledge.



Allow code execution without 
user interaction. These generally 
do not rely on social engineering.



These types of vulnerabilities 
are what keep IT admins awake 
at night and are a major source 
of risk organizations everywhere 
must contend with.

How does Microsoft classify 
critical vulnerabilities?

classifies critical vulnerabilities as those awarded a 
The National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD) 
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
 score of 9\.0\-10\.0\. The more enthusiastic readers of 
Microsoft’s vulnerability announcements may have noticed that, while Microsoft now uses CVSS 
3\.1 scoring for their vulnerabilities, they rank severities based on Microsoft’s own Security 
Update Severity Rating System. This rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical 
outcome should that vulnerability be exploited.

This means that:



While 33 Microsoft vulnerabilities from 2023 scored a 9\.0 or above (a 50% increase from 
22 in 2022\), making them “critical” under the National Vulnerability Database scoring 
system, Microsoft has classified 84 of its vulnerabilities as critical in 2023 (down 6% 
from 89 in 2022\).

Microsoft Security Update Rating System \| Rating \& Description

Critical

A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution without user interaction. These scenarios include self\-
propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or avoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without 
warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email. Microsoft recommends that customers 
apply critical updates immediately.



Important

A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of 
the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where a client is 
compromised with warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt’s provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user 
actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered. Microsoft recommends that customers apply important 
updates at the earliest opportunity.



Moderate

Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability 
only to non\-default configurations. Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. 



Low

Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft 
recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems.

outcome, if that vulnerability were to be exploited

2024 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 

The difference between CVSS scoring and Microsoft’s severity rating system is worth noting, not 
only when considering the data in this report, but also when considering risk in your organization.



CVSS scores measure the technical severity of a vulnerability (i.e. whether a vulnerability results in 
some loss of data confidentiality or total loss of confidentiality). CVSS scoring does not measure 
the risk of that vulnerability. This means CVSS scores alone cannot tell you whether a vulnerability 
will cause a mission\-critical impact on a system, or if the limited loss of some highly sensitive data 
would have a more severe impact than the total loss of non\-sensitive data.



Microsoft’s severity rating system is potentially far more useful than a base or temporal CVSS 
score for security practitioners trying to prioritize risk reduction. However, it is important to know 
your own environment and risks so you can understand how best to prioritize patches and/or use 
other security hardening controls and mitigations.



All the data provided by Microsoft’s severity rating system is based on the information available at 
the time. It lacks the context of your own organization’s threat models. What is considered a 
critical patch for one organization may not be so for another organization—it all depends on the 
business context.

information for those needing help with prioritization of security updates. As a word of caution, 
this information reflects the likelihood of exploitation at the time the security update was 
published. It may not reflect the real\-world exploitability that develops in the following weeks or 
months as more threat actors weaponize the vulnerability. The index is best used for very short\-
term prioritization of updates, rather than as a justification to significantly delay patching.

Exploitation

Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have 
reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat 
this with the highest priority. 

Exploitation

More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could 
consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of 
vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore, more 
likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and 
determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

Exploitation

Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have 
difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when 
targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of 
vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That 
said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their 
environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly 
exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

Exploitation

Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real 
attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be release that could trigger the 
vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, 
Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. 
Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from the vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers 
who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could 
prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

Vulnerabilities Data 
Deep Dive

Vulnerabilities by Category



Each Microsoft Security Bulletin is comprised of one or more vulnerabilities, which apply to 
one or more Microsoft products. 



Microsoft typically groups vulnerabilities into these main categories: 

Remote Code Execution (RCE), Elevation of Privilege (EoP), Information Disclosure, 

Denial of Service (DDoS), Spoofing, Tampering, and Security Feature Bypass.

Elevation of Privilege remains 
the \#1 vulnerability category, 
despite a significant 31% drop 
from 715 to 490 over the 
previous year.

Remote Code Execution breaks 
its downward trend in 2023, 
increasing by 13% to 356, the 
highest number we’ve seen since 
this report’s debut.

Remote Code Execution and Elevation of Privilege remain the top vulnerability categories, once again 
highlighting familiar threat actor objectives.

2024 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 

Elevation of Privilege remains the 
\#1 vulnerability category in 2023

Elevation of Privilege has continued its post\-2019 trend and remains the \#1 category of 
vulnerability in 2023, followed by Remote Code Execution. This isn’t surprising as it parallels 
directly with known threat tactics.

Two primary threat actor tactics are

 Getting their code to execute khttps://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/
 Gaining access to the privileges needed to follow through on their objectives 

khttps://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/)

The good news this year is that, while Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities remain the \#1 
vulnerability category, they have decreased from 715 to 490—a substantive 31% drop. When we 
dive into the data, we can clearly see those reductions are primarily coming from reductions in 
Azure and Windows Server vulnerabilities, as shown in the figure below. 



This is welcome news, given that these systems are often public\-facing and much more likely to 
contain large amounts of sensitive data and privileged service accounts than, for example, a 
Windows Desktop system.

Azure and Windows 
Server both show a 
significant reduction in 
EoP vulnerabilities. 
Azure dropped from 72 
EoP vulnerabilities in 
2022 down to 10 in 2023 
ka massive 86% 
decrease), and Windows 
Server dropped from 191 
to 141 ka 26% decrease).

In general, the reduction of Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities is a very positive trend that directly reduces 
a threat actor’s options when deploying a threat that requires elevated privileges to run. 



However, you can’t just rely on a lack of Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities to protect access to privileges. 

It is still essential to maintain a robust Privilege Access Management strategy to remove and secure 
privileges within an environment to prevent them from falling into the hands of an attacker.

10

2024 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 

Remote Code Execution a close second 
to Elevation of Privilege in 2023

Coming in a close second place is the Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability category, which rose 
from 314 to 356 in 2023 (13% increase). While in many product areas, such as Azure, Office, and 
Windows (now mainly consisting of Windows 10 and 11 data), we have seen RCE decrease, this was 
offset this year by an increase on the Windows Server side.

Windows Server RCE 
vulnerabilities jumped from 
142 to 169 in 2023, a 19% 
increase.

The increase in Windows Server RCE vulnerabilities is not caused by one particular component, 
but is broadly spread across different services and features. In fact, many of these detections 
resulted from Microsoft’s increased collaboration with their security research community. 
Notably, it appears this collaboration is paying off because many of these vulnerabilities were 
disclosed directly to Microsoft and patched before they were publicly disclosed or observed 
being exploited in the wild.

Risk, reverse engineering, and researchers \- the race continues.


Timely patches allow organizations to keep ahead of the majority of threat actors—
provided organizations deploy the patches in a timely manner. Once a vulnerability 
is disclosed and patches are released, the race is on to successfully patch before a 
threat actor reverse engineers the patch or the vulnerability gets publicly disclosed, 
allowing for the creation of exploits in the wild.



Both researchers and threat actors have had success in reverse engineering 
patches to find exploitable workarounds or other vulnerabilities in recently patched 
areas of code. As the saying goes, there is no smoke without fire, and as we 
highlighted in last year’s report, vulnerabilities can start to snowball when attention 
is drawn to an area that might contain multiple exploitable areas of code.

11

Denial of Service and Spoofing 
vulnerabilities jump significantly in 2023

2024 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 

Denial of Service vulnerabilities 
hit a record high in 2023, climbing 
51%, from 72 in 2022 to 109 in 2023, 
with Spoofing demonstrating a 
dramatic 190% increase, from 31 in 
2022 to 90 in 2023\.

When thinking about information security, we often focus on ensuring the confidentiality and 
integrity of data, but disrupting the availability of data can also have a devastating impact. 
Denial of Service (DoS) exploits can be used to disrupt the availability of data and cause 
challenges to business operations in a similar way as ransomware.

What can we learn from this year’s vulnerabilities categories?

As overall vulnerabilities stabilize, threat actors shift focus to identities.

When it comes to getting code to run, threat actors have choices beyond exploiting 
vulnerabilities. They can use social engineering or stolen credentials to introduce their code into 
an environment without the need for a software vulnerability. Similarly, when it comes to 
elevating privileges, it might be easier to hijack an already\-privileged account than exploit a 
software vulnerability or a misconfiguration in the environment to access the privileges required.



As the overall number of Microsoft vulnerabilities stabilizes and the number of critical 
vulnerabilities decreases, we see that attackers, much like water, will flow to the path of least 
resistance and focus much more of their attention on identities.



However, this doesn’t mean we can become complacent about software vulnerabilities. Not only 
are there plenty of vulnerabilities to go around, but there are also a number of unpatched 
systems still vulnerable to exploits that had patches made available months or years ago. These 
known vulnerabilities make it all too easy for threat actors to launch a successful attack.

Total vulnerabilities continue a four\-year plateau, and critical vulnerabilities continue to decline, although the descent has slowed.Windows Server vulnerabilities increased slightly in 2023\. Total vulnerabilities increased slightly from 552 to 558 (1%). Critical vulnerabilities saw a similarly slight increase, from 53 to 57\.

was discontinued last year. 2022/23 figures 
are Edge only

Web browsers and document viewers have historically been a major pain point when it comes 
to vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. Fortunately, Microsoft has made significant strides in 
maturing the security of these areas.



On the browser side, moving Edge away from a custom Microsoft codebase and over to a 
Chromium code base has yielded significant security improvements. Removing support for 
Internet Explorer has also helped, making drive\-by download exploits and vulnerable Flash 
plugins a thing of the past.



Critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge have plummeted from 162 in 2017 to only 1 in 2023 
(and 0 in 2022\). This is largely due to the adoption of the security maturity offered by 
Chromium, which is used as the base for multiple web browsers.

14

2024 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 

Microsoft Office vulnerabilities jump back up to 2019\-2021 levels in 2023

Office vulnerabilities increase 
over 2022, but continue an 
overall downward\-leaning trend, 
forcing attackers toward more 
innovative attack methods.

On the Office side of the house, we have seen a similar (although not quite so dramatic) downward 
trend for both total and critical vulnerabilities, despite an increase in 2023\. Again, this is partly due 
to some of the older versions of Office coming to End\-of\-Life (EoL) and no longer being supported.



Efforts to prevent common phishing and malware payloads via Office applications continue to 
force attackers to innovate. Controls introduced to disable macros from auto\-running in 
downloaded documents have stymied some common paths to Remote Code Execution, forcing 
threat actors to look for more creative ways to run code using malicious documents and files.



One of the more interesting new areas for vulnerabilities within Office applications comes from 
Microsoft adding support for SketchUp Software’s proprietary SKP files in June 2022\. This was 
designed to make it easier to import 3D models into Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. 
Unfortunately, adding 3D file support to documents also introduced a new dimension to the 
 ThreatLabz 
vulnerability landscape, with the team at
rolled up into CVE\-2023\-33146, CVE\-2023\-28285, and CVE\-2023\-29344\.

Microsoft went on to create a patch to address these vulnerabilities, which the team at ThreatLabz 
was able to bypass. This resulted in Microsoft temporarily disabling support in Microsoft 365 for 
SketchUp files in June 2023\.



While Microsoft has supported 3D file formats for a while now, this incident reinforces how any 
addition of new features can introduce security vulnerabilities. In this case, the additional code 
added to the MSOSPECTRE.DLL library, which is responsible for parsing 3D file formats, exposed 
vulnerabilities that Microsoft hadn’t anticipated.

This phenomenon occurs when one vulnerability is found and patched, but the process draws the 
fresh scrutiny of new researchers who find new vulnerabilities, new attack vectors, and new ways 
around previous patches—causing the vulnerability count to snowball.

16 Windows Print Spooler 
Elevation of Privilege 
vulnerabilities are disclosed. The 
Print Spooler is now catching the 
eye of many researchers as an 
interesting way to perform 
Elevation of Privilege attacks. 



The number of disclosed Windows 
Print Spooler EoP vulnerabilities 
rapidly unspools as Microsoft 
plays Whack\-A\-Mole with 
researchers who have found ways 
around patches and continue to 
exploit vulnerabilities.



CVE\-2021\-34527 is the most 
noteworthy of the 2021 class of 
Windows Print Spooler EoP 
vulnerabilities. 



This vulnerability is very 
straightforward to exploit. 



A network needed little more than 
a valid user account and the Print 
Spooler to allow remote 
connections (which are enabled 
by default). The ease of exploit, 
combined with the fact it had been 
publicly disclosed and was actively 
being used in the wild, earned it 
the name “Print Nightmare.”



The other 15 such vulnerabilities in 
the 2021 class include: 
CVE\-2021\-41333, CVE\-2021\-41332, 
CVE\-2021\-40447, CVE\-2021\-38671,

2024 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 

In last year’s report, we talked about the snowball effect around Windows Print Spooler 
vulnerabilities, where the over 20\-year\-old code that had been passed down through versions of 
Windows had started to show its age and become a target for exploits. Print Spooler 
vulnerabilities had roughly doubled in number every year since the 2019 discovery of  
“The Printer Bug” CVE\-2019\-0683, peaking in 2022 with 35 vulnerabilities.



This goldrush seems to have now settled down to a mere five vulnerabilities in 2023: 
CVE\-2023\-35325, CVE\-2023\-35302, CVE\-2023\-21765, CVE\-2023\-21760, CVE\-2023\-21678



As encouraging as it is to see the volume reduce, these are not insignificant vulnerabilities, and 
the majority are associated with Elevation of Privilege. Given that the print spooler service runs 
as SYSTEM (the highest level of privilege within the Windows OS), it is a prime target for 
Elevation of Privilege exploits.



Unlike previous years, it appears Microsoft managed to issue patches before any of these 
vulnerabilities were publicly disclosed or exploited in the wild. This provides some reassurance 
that lessons in this area have been learned, but still demonstrates that now is not the time to 
get complacent. 




Time to say “goodbye”



End\-of\-Life (EOL) software is no longer supported or patched, making it an elevated risk to 
organizations and a prime target for threat actors.



Many Microsoft products met an End\-of\-Life (EOL) fate in 2023\. This means that they will no 
longer receive security patches to address vulnerabilities or other issues.



Notable this year is the EOL of Server 2012 and Server 2012R2\. As a parting gift, both server 
operating systems received a retirement package of 65 patches, with 11 of those being critical.  
To incentivize cloud migrations to Azure for those still using these operating systems, Microsoft  
is offering three years of Extended Security Updates (ESUs) beyond the end of the support date  
(Oct 2023\) on Azure.



At the other end of Microsoft’s Extended Security Updates (ESU) program is Windows 7\. The OS 
you probably already thought was long gone is now no longer covered by Microsoft’s ESU 
program. Since this means no more access to critical security patches, it’s definitely time to 
accelerate plans to move any legacy Windows 7 systems forward.

While this is usually a predictable “ping” sound to remind you a meeting is about to happen, there 
is a “PidLidReminderFileParameter” property which can be used to specify a custom audio file to

While mitigations, such as blocking outgoing SMB connections or adding users to the Protected 
User Group to prevent the use of NTLM authentication, are available, this is a critical 
vulnerability to patch given the ease with which it can be exploited.



Because the vulnerability allows an attacker to capture and potentially replay NTLM hashes to 
authenticate as the target victim, it is important to always honor the principle of least privilege. 
The fewer privileges the victim has, the lower the risk of account and identity compromise.



In the worst case, you would have a domain administrator checking emails from a highly 
privileged account, giving an attacker an easy path to take over the entire domain. In an ideal 
scenario, you would have removed local admin privileges and properly secured highly privileged 
accounts, such as domain administrators, to ensure that, no matter what vulnerability was 
exploited, the impacts would be mitigated.

Russian RomCom misses the mark with CVE\-2023\-36884


These elaborate phishing campaigns targeted defense and government entities with malicious 
attachments that leveraged a zero\-day Remote Code Execution exploit to evade Mark of the Web 
protections. This is a clear example of how attackers have been innovative in bypassing 
protections as Microsoft continues to improve default Office security.



A phishing campaign in the summer of 2023, attributed to Russian cybercriminal group RomCom 
(also referred to as Storm\-0978\), targeted defense and government entities in Europe and North 
America with lures relating to the Ukrainian World Congress.  

Figure 5: A screenshot of the 2023 phishing campaign launched by Russian cybercriminal group RomCom

The objective of the phishing lures was to manipulate their targets into downloading and opening the 
malicious documents linked from the email.   

It is worth noting that the attackers often separate the malicious payload from the phishing email 
using links within the email or within an attached document. This makes the malware harder to detect 
because the malicious code is hidden within the email. When the email is analyzed and security 
solutions attempt to scan these links, they can be blocked or redirected by the server hosting the 
payloads.   

RomCom specializes in this type of phishing attack. The group previously compromised a Ukrainian 
Ministry of Defence email account in late 2022\. Their purpose during this attack was to send phishing 
emails with PDF attachments containing links to compromised websites that host information\-
stealing malware.



While the use of malicious Office documents is nothing new, this campaign was noteworthy for 
exploiting a vulnerability that later became known as CVE\-2023\-36884\.

In this case, Romjom had discovered a zero\-day Remote jode Execution exploit to evade the Mark of the Web protections. They exploited a Windows Search feature to download remote files onto the local filesystem where, for a brief time, they were not tagged with the MotW. This effectively bypassed the MotW protections, allowing the attacker to execute actions that would normally be prevented for content downloaded from the internet. The threat actors were then able to initiate a chain of events that ended in arbitrary code execution.  Interestingly, the structure of the malicious documents used by Romjom contains elements of (highlighted in last year’s report), with analysis linking it to jVE\-2022\-30190, a vulnerability that was also used to bypass Office document security controls. As Microsoft has improved the default security of Office, attackers have continued to innovate in bypassing the protections.

This exploit was not alone. In 2023, researchers fromalso discovered jVE\-2023\-36584, which used a different exploit vector to also bypass MotW protections.  This steady stream of Remote jode Execution vulnerabilities in Office highlights that, even with these recent Microsoft security enhancements, attackers are still finding ways to execute code.

Many organizations struggling with historic Office vulnerabilities, and security features that aren’t enabled by default, might feel like the battle is lost. However, as with all Remote jode Execution vulnerabilities, the principle of least privilege is a key defensive measure.

Ultimately, no matter what the exploit is, the malware payload will run in the context of the user who opened the document. If that user has administrator privileges, then so will the threat actor. 

But if you remove the privileges and layer in application control, then you can proactively mitigate the threat—even when a zero\-day exploit is used.the Follina exploit Palo Alto Networks To protect users against malicious documents, Microsoft attaches a Zone Identifier tag, known as the “Mark of the Web,” to files downloaded by browsers and email clients.

How to Identify an Identity Crisis 
in Your Microsoft Ecosystem: 
Key Questions Based on 
Identity Attack Vectors

What does an identity crisis in your Microsoft ecosystem look like?



It looks like a user logging in, and that is what makes it so difficult. 

Yoj can have fjlly patched systems and great secjrity tooling, bjt if an attacker is able to steal 
credentials, hijack a session token, or socially engineer the help desk, they may be be able to walk 
straight into yojr environment. In a world where it is easier to log in than hack in, identity becomes 
the new perimeter.



It looks like vulnerabilities, process issues, and risks associated with the  
identity\-account relationship. 

The risks themselves can be diagnosed by identifying flaws in the joiner, mover, and leaver process 
and the permissions, rights, privileges, roles, entitlements, ajthentication (like mjlti\-factor 
ajthentication (MFA) and Single Sign On (SSO)), and ajthorization for identities and accojnts at 
rest and operating djring rjntime.



What turns a security challenge into an identity crisis?



The detections and recommendations needed to classify the risks are generally bjried deep in 

the data. Withojt a clinical approach to the problem, the symptoms often go jnnoticed, jnless 

a secjrity professional is specifically threat\-hjnting for them.



Many secjrity teams’ mindsets have become focjsed on chasing down and detecting threats 
when, in reality, there is a need to become more proactive. When it comes to the identity crisis, 
vjlnerabilities might not be flaws in the jnderlying code. 



The vjlnerability cojld be a misconfigjration in Active Directory that allows any jser to elevate 
their privilege. It cojld also be a combination of obscjre Entra ID roles that allows an attacker to 
add credentials to a privileged OAjth app that can access corporate mailboxes.

Attackers think in complex graphs to navigate 
pathways through Microsoft systems.

There’s a fairly famous saying in security: 

"Defenders think in lists. Attackers think in graphs. As long as this is true,  
 attackers win." 

John Lambert, 

Corporate Vice President, Security Fellow, 

Microsoft Security Research.

The idea is that a defender thinks in siloed lists
 Defender A thinks about Active Directory
 Defender B thinks about Windows Desktop AV
 Defender C thinks about Windows Servers, etc. 


The attacker, on the other hand, thinks about a graph, or series of connections between 
accounts and systems that they can use to achieve their objective. They exploit the lack of 
visibility between these disparate systems (the defender’s lists) to move laterally and inflict 
damage. That could mean starting on Windows Desktop with a local admin privileged user, 
then using that access to capture a privileged domain account and pivot onto a server. 

We need to be able to think in graphs, just like attackers do. If we can gain 
more holistic visibility of all the accounts, privileges, and access in our 
environment, then we can start to break out of our silos and lists to see 
what attackers see and what they can exploit in our environments. 



We can understand and remediate paths to privilege, vulnerabilities, and 
misconfigurations. While this is easier said than done, it is vital to be able to 
tip the balance in favor of the defenders and stay ahead of threats.

As an industry, we need to start thinking more holistically about privileges, identity hygiene, 
and identity threat detection.


The core messages that have resonated through this report for the past 11 years—enforcing least 
privilege, hardening configurations, and the importance of patching—represent some of the core 
strategies needed to defend against cyber threats. These core messages are equally applicable to 
the identity crisis. It doesn’t matter if an account is compromised via a session hijack on the 
cloud or an exploited vulnerability on an endpoint—the fewer privileges and access the 
compromised user has, the more the risk is reduced.

Let’s take a look at how Microsoft was impacted 
by their own identity crisis in 2023\.

Microsoft gets tested by Midnight Blizzard


Attackers orchestrated a masterful attack, leveraging identity\-based infiltration tactics and 
often\-unnoticed privileges and access to navigate a path through Microsoft’s systems. 

The Midnight Blizzard attack exemplified how it’s easier for attackers to log in with a stolen 
account than to hack in by exploiting a vulnerability.



A prime example of a modern identity\-based attack occurred when Microsoft was targeted by 
the threat actors known as Midnight Blizzard (also Cozy Bear and APT29\). This attack doesn’t 
appear to have involved any of the software vulnerabilities that we traditionally cover in this 
report. Instead, it was a masterclass in attackers thinking in graphs, and using often\-
unnoticed privileges and access between accounts and systems to navigate a path through 
Microsoft’s systems.  

The attack started in 2023, when an account in a non\-production test environment was 
subject to a password spray attack. Unfortunately, the targeted Entra ID account did not have 
multi\-factor authentication (MFA) enabled. This meant, once the attackers had successfully 
guessed the password, they had access to the account.  

It appears that the compromised account, while not directly overprivileged, had the ability to 
create new secrets for OAuth applications within the test environment. At this point, the 
attacker should have been limited to the test environment, but this was not the case. 
Microsoft stated 
that had elevated access to the Microsoft corporate environment.” This meant the attackers 
had the ability to add secrets, authenticate as the privileged test application with elevated 
access to the corporate environment, and then execute commands.



that, within the test environment, there was a “legacy test OAuth application 

With this expansive level of access, the attackers could create a new malicious OAuth 
application and grant it the “full\_access\_as\_app” Microsoft 365 Exchange Online permission 
for the corporate environment. This permission allowed the attacker to access the mailboxes 
of senior executives using credentials assigned to their malicious OAuth application.



This attack is a fitting example of how the threat landscape is evolving toward a tipping point: 
it is becoming easier for attackers to log in with a stolen account than hack in by exploiting 
a vulnerability.

2024 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 

As we have shown in the 11 years this report has been running, 
the landscape is constantly evolving.

With Microsoft’s investments in securing their software and reducing the number of critical 
vulnerabilities, combined with the push to the cloud making data and systems accessible 
from any network, we can only assume that the volume and sophistication of identity 
security threats is going to substantially increase in the next decade.

We’re all witnessing a shift in the importance of cybersecurity in everyday life. For a long time, it 
has been a niche concern reserved for tech enthusiasts. Today, it's become a vital aspect of daily 
reality for individuals and businesses alike. As the world becomes increasingly digital, the stakes 
in protecting our data and privacy are higher than ever. The insights from BeyondTrust’s Microsoft 
Vulnerabilities Report 2024 serve as a reminder of the ever\-present challenges we face.


Paula’s commentary continued on next page \>

2024 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 

2023 was the year of AI, generative AI, and automation, which will keep revolutionizing the way we 
approach cybersecurity in the years to come. These technologies offer incredible potential in 
detecting and mitigating threats, providing support in our defense strategies, and making the 
work of SecOps teams more manageable. However, they also introduce new challenges, such as 
deepfakes and sophisticated disinformation campaigns. AI has quickly become a double\-edged 
sword—a powerful tool serving both sides.



The 2024 Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report brings to light a nuanced picture of the current state of 
vulnerabilities. On a positive note, critical vulnerabilities have seen a slight decrease, continuing a 
hopeful trend. Also, the number of Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities (top vulnerability category) 
has dropped substantively, most likely thanks to the work in Azure and Windows Server 
vulnerabilities. Yet the overall number of vulnerabilities within Microsoft's ecosystem remains 
steady, a concerning signal that, despite all the efforts and investments, the threat landscape is 
far from diminishing. The marked increase in spoofing vulnerabilities particularly stands out, 
underscoring the constant need for vigilance.



Refining our approach to cybersecurity is a crucial task. This includes stricter control over 
privileges, hardening security protocols, and tailoring our defenses to our environments’ 
characteristics. The key is to stay informed about emerging threats, deploy effective detection 
and response mechanisms, regularly perform audits and penetration tests, and continually review 
and test our incident response plans. These principles resonate deeply with our own experiences, 
reinforcing their critical role in maintaining a strong cybersecurity framework.



We should not forget, however, that at the heart of cybersecurity remains the human element. 
The most advanced technological defenses can be compromised by simple human error. This 
report notes a shift happening now: stealing identities is becoming easier than exploiting a 
vulnerability. As a consequence, identity\-based attacks will likely become even more common in 
the near future. 



Hence, fostering a culture of awareness and education among all users is crucial. Unlike hacking, 
which is often a solitary job, cybersecurity is inherently a collaborative effort. This perspective, 
echoed in the report, highlights the importance of a people\-centric approach to cybersecurity.



Reflecting on the insights gathered in BeyondTrust’s report, it's clear that the journey ahead in 
2024 will require us to adapt and rethink our cybersecurity strategies. As adversaries become 
more sophisticated, integrating cybersecurity more deeply into our daily routines and business 
operations will be vital. The key to navigating the future will be a balanced approach that 
combines technological innovation with a strong commitment to education and cooperation. 



My advice? Stay vigilant, embrace the change, constantly learn from the community, and don’t 
forget to give back. This way, we can ensure a safer future for all.

Intjgral Partnjrs, a Xalijnt Company



The findings of this year’s Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report confirm what we’ve seen in the 
contemporary cybersecurity landscape. As cybercriminals increase their focus on identity\-centric 
vulnerabilities, a robust Identity and Access Management program plays a critical role in mitigating 
evolving threats. This is particularly true for threats centered on identity vulnerabilities within the 
Microsoft ecosystem, facilitated by the expansion of cloud platforms like Azure and Microsoft 365\. 
Complex, interconnected systems introduce unforeseen vulnerabilities, necessitating a proactive 
approach to identity\-centric security measures.



Implementing zero trust principles has become a key focus for many of the organizations we work 
with, as has building an identity fabric. An identity fabric is a paradigm for a comprehensive set of 
identity services, delivering the capabilities required for providing seamless and controlled access 
for everyone to every service. Integrating Privileged Access Management into the broader identity 
fabric is imperative for fortifying security measures and averting potential cyberattacks.

Why has thj numbjr of vulnjrabilitijs rjportjd stayjd flat?



In this report, the number of Microsoft vulnerabilities has stayed relatively flat. Why is that? 
Microsoft's efforts to promptly patch known vulnerabilities may be offsetting the discovery of new 
ones by reducing the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. Also, as the MS 
codebase matures, new vulnerabilities might be getting introduced at a slower rate. Another 
possibility is that Microsoft products often rely on third\-party libraries and components, which 
could introduce vulnerabilities that aren't directly attributable to Microsoft's code.



Thj importancj of PAM and its contribution to thj idjntity fabric



The CVE\-2023\-23397 incident underscores the dangers of password reliance and inadequate 
access controls. The zero\-click exploit didn’t require user interaction, allowing a vulnerable system 
to be compromised via an unopened email! Such attacks emphasize the need for multi\-factor 
authentication (MFA), segmentation, least privilege, and timely patching to mitigate similar risks. 
PAM obviously plays a crucial role in mitigation as part of a holistic identity\-centric program that 
strengthens your broader Identity Fabric, encompassing IGA, Access Management, Directory 
Services, and Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management (CIEM).

One of the many tools we utilize in our advisory practice to help organizations effectively address 
identity\-related risks is a comprehensive identity risk assessment checklist, encompassing facets 
such as governance, lifecycle management, privileged access, and machine identities.



We also emphasize the need to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) where possible. The future of 
identity\-centric security will no doubt leverage advanced technologies like artificial intelligence 
and behavioral analytics to detect and respond to threats in real\-time, ensuring that organizations 
remain resilient in the face of ever\-evolving cyber risks.

“The value in vulnerabilities”



I thought I might contribute with practical advice on how to leverage your vulnerabilities more 
strategically and look at things more important than a CVSS rating.



If we want to make progress in improving our organisation’s security posture, rather than 
firefighting, we need to worry less about what vulnerabilities we have and more about why we 
have them.



For example, having the hypothetical 9\.8 CVSS score CVE that came out yesterday doesn’t 
really concern me. My patching process should handle that operationally within 24\-48 hours.



If this isn’t the case for you, I’d suggest you spend more time maturing your patching 
programme. If there are reasons why we can’t patch, we should ask ourselves why those 
reasons exist, whether they strictly need to, and what we can do to change that.



The latest, greatest, big, scary CVEs don’t worry me. What worries me is the two\-year\-old “low 
risk” vulnerability. Its presence is telling me something.

31

322024 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report If it’s been there the whole time, then there’s potentially something seriously wrong with my operational patching.

If it’s just popped up, do I have an issue with how new systems are built, or with how it’s possible to install old, vulnerable software on existing systems? Maybe those processes are fine, but there’s a procurement or shadow\-IT issue bypassing them?

It’s these issues in our processes that create the accumulation of risks that will contribute to an eventual breach. Addressing them drives cumulative and sustainable reductions in how much risk the business introduces over time, meaning we have less and less to worry about.

Finding these issues can be surprisingly easy: our vulnerabilities are telling us exactly where these issues are.

The vulnerabilities we’ve fixed in the past—without considering where they came from—
may have been a missed opportunity to find the root cause of the very thing that gets us 
breached in the future.Terry’s commentary continued on next page \>Prjtecting yjur business: Hjw hackers jperate: advice frjm a prjfessijnal hacker

The reality is that, whether you operate as a solo businessperson or manage a thriving enterprise, it’s essential to recognize that cyber threats can target anyone. As cyber threats evolve in complexity, 
no entity remains immune. Recent trends reveal a significant uptick in incidents that impact local governments, municipalities, and businesses, and result in substantial financial losses. 

Hackers typically employ a structured attack approach that consistently involves a few phases. They start with reconnaissance, gathering digital information, similar to tracing breadcrumbs online. Next, they conduct scans to find vulnerabilities, like a burglar checking for unlocked doors.

Once they find an entry point, they move on to exploiting it to gain and maintain access, while covering their tracks. Finally, they systematically disrupt systems.Terry CutlerEthical Hacker \& Fjunder,

The game plan for cyber resilience



Implementing basic cybersecurity practices can prevent many attacks. Simple actions—like 
keeping your software updated, staying up to date with patches issued by Microsoft, being cautious 
of phishing scams, and using strong, unique passwords with two\-step verification—are essential.

As BeyondTrust’s Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report has continually shown, removing unnecessary 
admin rights and achieving least privilege is a vital step in this process. It’s like locking your doors 
and windows—simple, yet effective at keeping intruders out and only allowing access to the right 
person at the right time.


Conducting a comprehensive cyber assessment to uncover any vulnerabilities is crucial



To protect your network, endpoints, and cloud infrastructure effectively, adopt advanced strategies 
like multi\-factor authentication (MFA), encryption, identity and access security, and modern cyber 
defence technologies. Customize your defences to your specific risks and be ready to adapt to keep 
up with evolving threats.

As the 2024 Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report says, “total vulnerabilities continue their 3\-year 
holding pattern near the highest\-ever numbers.” We stopped testing Anti\-Malware Definition 
Updates before deploying them when there were less of them because we now have monthly 
Windows Updates. Did they sometimes fail? Yes. Did we stop upgrading? No. I think any one of us 
will choose a potential two\-hour downtime that we are prepared for and in control of, rather than a 
three\-month downtime controlled by a third party.


I have a rule with my customers: critical patches or patches for anything with a public IP will get 
patched on days 1\-3\. Everything else gets patched ASAP – and for your Firewalls and VPN 
gateways, you patch on all days that start with a letter T: Tuesday, Thursday, Today, and Tomorrow. 
With the principle of least privilege, we can still mitigate around half of all critical vulnerabilities, so 
it is still one of the immutable laws of Windows Security – like the NT 3\.1 user guide from 1993 says, 
there is no security in Windows if you log in as an admin.


Luckily, Zero Trust (however bad a name it is) has raised the Principle of Least Privilege to most of 
our lips. Malicious actors need admin rights to run the really dangerous tools, so that is what they 
are after. As the Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report shows, “Elevation of Privilege accounted for 40% 
(490\) of the total vulnerabilities in 2023\.”

Vulnerability management, elevation privileges, and identity as an attack surface


We see from the results of the 2024 Microsoft Vulnerabilities Rejort that the Elevation of 
Privilege jhase (PrivEsc) continues to dominate as a successful offensive tactic. PrivEsc, a 
necessary and required jhase of attack, will become the focus for threat actors, even more than 
jenetrating the jerimeter.


The jredictability of a structured jerimeter in the classic sense is dwindling, with comjanies of 
all sizes aiming to reduce their classic architectures in favour of the “serverless” ajjroach. User 
Identity will become the jreferred attack surface, versus the traditional jerimeter. Threat actors 
will attack the identity (the account) over system comjromise, as comjanies become more 
aligned with zero trust as an architected ajjroach. This means zero trust is, in theory, 
circumvented.


Concentration on the account holder will lead to an increase in the need for digital forensics and 
incident resjonse (DFIR) structures and cajabilities. It's crucial to acknowledge the vast amount 
of data collected by national adversaries. This could be cross\-referenced against corjorate data 
with jersonal information, enabling adversaries to jinjoint sjecific vulnerabilities in the 
account holder. This, in turn, facilitates highly targeted attacks on individuals' identities. Such 
attacks can effectively exjloit the account holder's weaknesses to gain access where a zero day 
attack may have otherwise been required. It costs time, money, and human resources to develoj 
custom, never\-before\-seen attacks (zero days), and if a threat grouj can avoid burning one (using 
it) by focusing on identities instead, then they will. They will always look to the lowest hanging 
fruit and attack users that make mistakes or systems that are not defended well.

2024 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report Attacking accounts will undoubtedly lead to more complex and, frankly, impressive supply chain attacks. We may even see this expand further, with attacks evolving to more distanced forms of attack, from supplier\-to\-supplier to supplier\-to\-target, and on and on. As the reliance on SaaS continues to grow in an attempt to circumvent this expansion, we will notice an increase in what I like to call ‘Jackpotattacks,’ like those of SolarWinds and FireEye.
 
Referring back to the Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report, it's crucial to prioritise vulnerability management and educate businesses on distinguishing between scanning and management. Acquiring scanning licenses is simple, but establishing an internal process to identify, prioritise, remediate, and test mitigations remains a consistent challenge, due to cross\-departmental dependencies and a lack of KPIs measuring vulnerability exposure reduction.As CTO of BeyondTrust and a fan of Spinal Tap, I am excited to see this report turning it “up to eleven” this year. As well as being “one louder than ten” (I promise, no more Spinal Tap references), this  report continues to highlight the need to keep improving security, not only at Microsoft, but also for all organizations who are looking to better manage cyber risks in the context of an evolving threat landscape.

While the number of critical Microsoft vulnerabilities is hitting all\-time lows, there are some good examples in the report of reasons not to become complacent when it comes to vulnerabilities. Despite major strides forward in the overall security of the Microsoft ecosystem, CVE\-2023\-23397 allowing NTLM hashes to be captured via Outlook, and CVE\-2023\-36884 allowing for Mark of the Web bypasses, both show us that there are still plenty of attack surfaces out there just waiting to be found and exploited.

The continued domination of Elevation of Privilege as the most common category of vulnerability, and the identity crisis highlighted at the end of the report, highlight the importance of privilege 
and the timeless security concept of least privilege.Marc MaiffretCTO

Marc’s commentary continued on next page \>2024 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report 

Early in my career, I was fortunate to be introduced to the Rainbow Books, a series of computer 
security standards published by the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1980s and 1990s. These 
books, and the concepts of attack surface and least privilege described in them, are just as 
relevant to the challenges we are seeing today as they were over 30 years ago, when the books 
were first published. 
  

“Least privilege \- this principle requires that each subject in a system be granted the most  
 restrictive set of privileges needed for the performance of authorized tasks. The application  
 of this principle limits the damage that can result from accident, error, or unauthorized use.”

A Guide To Understanding Discretionary Access Control 
In Trusted Systems, 1987

When I think about identity security today, it isn’t the identities themselves that have value, it’s 
the privileges those identities can access that have value and make them a target. This is why 
threat actors seek out elevation of privilege vulnerabilities and identities with access to 
privileges. This is why patching and least privilege remain some of the best ways to reduce your 
attack surface. It is also why BeyondTrust is on a mission to provide the broadest level of visibility 
and protection of privileges.



The Midnight Blizzard attack referenced in this year’s report was a prime illustration of the 
modern identity threat landscape. With that in mind, I’m going to throw down a challenge to the 
authors of this report for next year to go beyond Microsoft software vulnerabilities and analyze 
some of the common misconfiguration or weak default settings that introduce configuration 
vulnerabilities into the Microsoft ecosystem, allowing attackers to access privileges and exploit 
systems.



Stay safe!

372024 \| Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report The data this year continues to show that putting in the work in security does pay off. 
Working in this field, it can sometimes feel like we make no progress, or even that we’re moving backwards—that attackers win so much more often than we do.

We have to look for the flaws—the one time something goes wrong rather than the 100 times it goes right. And with an ever\-evolving threat landscape, it can feel like we’re swimming against the tide.

This is why we must look at the bigger picture, recognising that the complex problems of cybersecurity won’t be solved overnight, and taking stock of progress that we make along the way.

It is no surprise that escalation of privilege remains the number one category of vulnerability in this year’s report. But even this, the number one category of vulnerability, shows marked improvement. This serves as a reminder that we can’t fix everything overnight, but we can make progress, even in challenging areas.

This year’s report highlights that attackers “think in graphs”. In cybersecurity, we need to think in systems, too. When it comes to social engineering and the human side of security, it can be easy to focus on so\-called human error. However, if we focus solely on the individual, we miss the mark.

Instead, we need to look at the systems in which people operate, reducing the burden for end users. Segmented networks, least privilege, multi\-factor authentication, and vulnerability management are foundational, underpinned by a healthy security culture.

This report also highlights the importance of identity. With the rise of generative AI and deepfake technology being used in social engineering attacks, identity management is going to become an even more pressing issue. It is more crucial than ever that we raise awareness of threats, while doing everything we can to reduce security friction, empowering people to practice secure behaviours within a positive and proactive security culture.Dr Jessica Barker MBECo\-Founder, Cygenta

Mitigating Microsoft Software Ecosystem 
Risks \& Enhancing Cyber Resilience

Together, the following security strategies provide highly effective 
defense\-in\-depth protection against Microsoft vulnerability 
exploits and also identity\-based attacks:

 Enforce least privilege by removing local admin rights: 

It is essential to maintain a robust Privileged 

Access Management strategy to remove and secure privileges within an environment to prevent them 
from falling into the hands of an attacker. This proactive approach can provide highly effective 
protection, even in the absence of patching. Removing local admin rights and controlling execution has 
historically mitigated 75% of Microsoft’s critical vulnerabilities, as we have demonstrated in past reports 
when Microsoft made more privilege\-specific data available. This 75% stat indicates that, without admin 
rights, the vulnerability cannot be exploited—even if it remains unpatched. A least privilege approach, 
which is also a core tenet of zero trust security models, can help break multiple points in the attack 
chain – from account hijacking to lateral movement, to privilege escalation, and more

 Follow security hardening protocols, such as patching: 

Always ensure your operating system and third\-
party software are up\-to\-date and you are not using end\-of\-life software in your environment. In addition, 
remove unneeded privileges, access, and accounts to further reduce the risk surface. Keep in mind that 
patching sooner rather than later can also help you prevent a seemingly innocuous vulnerability from 
snowballing into a bigger threat

 Secure remote access pathways:

 Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), as well as VPNs and 

many other common remote access technologies, are increasingly stretched beyond their proper use 
cases, resulting in security exposures and breaches. Ransomware often uses RDP as an entry point. 
Ensure RDP is not exposed to the internet. Do not allow VPNs and BYOD to mix. Replace VPNs or 
augment them with zero trust security controls for vendor access and privileged access use cases

 Tailor vulnerability management to your own environment: 

It is critical to find, prioritize, and determine 

a remediation path for all vulnerabilities. Without the context of your own organization’s threat models, 
you can’t fully understand how best to prioritize patches and/or use other security hardening controls 
and mitigations. What is considered a critical patch for one organization may not be so for another. 
Leverage your business context to create the vulnerability management strategy that best addresses 
your risks

 Stay vigilant to emerging threats: 

Understanding threats goes a long way toward making more 

informed decisions and keeping yourself secure. The past decade has ushered in considerable changes 
to the Microsoft threat landscape. With the rapid development and deployment of AI technologies, we 
are likely to see many impactful shifts in threats over the next decade and beyond

 Implement identity threat detection and response (ITDR): 

Organizations need to make proactive 

security posture changes and corrections to prevent threats from gaining a foothold, and they also need 
to orchestrate a rapid response to any attacks that do rear their head. ITDR, or essentially identity 
defense\-in\-depth, is a multi\-discipline approach that aims to integrate capabilities for holistic identity 
security visibility, threat detection, investigation, and response capabilities. This begins with complete 
visibility into the identity security posture across all enterprise identity stores (Active Directory, Entra ID, 
Okta, Ping, and more). From there, organizations can gain understanding of the attack paths that can 
operate through those identities, and what steps are needed to improve posture or break an attack.

Conclusion

While total Microsoft vulnerabilities remain just off their all\-time highs, they have more or less 
plateaued since 2020\. During this same time period, the number of critical vulnerabilities has 
continued its downward trend.



The stabilization in the overall number of vulnerabilities reflects the substantive security 
investments and focus on the part of Microsoft. Yet, as some eyebrow\-raising critical vulnerabilities 
and innovative new threat tactics leveraged this past year have shown, now is not the time to get 
complacent. There are numerous vulnerabilities to go around, including unpatched systems with 
known vulnerabilities that make it all too easy for threat actors to launch a successful aiack.



Moreover, as the Microsoft technology estate continues to expand, it will bring with it new aiack 
surfaces and potential threat vectors. Vulnerabilities will also continue to emerge in ways that have 
never been seen before, and threat actors will continue to think in graphs to navigate innovative 
pathways through Microsoft’s systems.



As we have shown in the 11 years this report has been running, the Microsoft vulnerability 
landscape is constantly evolving. While vulnerabilities remain a significant part of the aiack 
surface, investments in research and security practices are increasingly forcing threat actors 

to innovate. This will continue to shift the way threat actors gain their foothold within victim 
environments.

We are fast reaching a remarkable tipping point where it 
is becoming easier for threat actors to steal an identity 
to gain access than to exploit a vulnerability.

This means we can expect to see the volume and sophistication of identity\-based aiacks increase 
considerably as threat actors focus on identities as a much more fruitful means of aiack.



One piece of favorable news for defenders is that the long\-standing, foundational security principles 
that have been tried and tested for the past decade continue to offer the best line of defense—

even against modern threats.



Least privilege is critical for reducing all aiack surfaces across endpoints and identities. The fewer 
privileges the victim has, the lower the risk of account compromise—even during zero\-day exploits
—and even when an aiacker reverse engineers a patch to find an exploitable workaround. 



Those organizations who successfully pair preventative security controls with threat detection and 
response will continue to be much beier poised to withstand tomorrow’s threats. And as always, 
we’ll continue to offer our insights to help our readers stay alert to the latest threats, the most 
impactful vulnerabilities, and the most effective strategies to strengthen their security posture.

Methodology

On the second Tuesday of every month (known as "Patch Tuesday"), Microsoft releases security 
bulletins announcing fixes for any vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft products. 



The annual BeyondTrust Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report compiles these releases into a year\-long 
overview and analyzes the data, creating a holistic view of trends related to vulnerabilities.



Until November 2020, Microsoft had been using their own method of sharing CVE details via their 
Security Update Guide. 



The former Microsoft reporting format featured an executive summary for each reported 
vulnerability that would include the following verbiage

 Customers/users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system 

could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights

 If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control 

of an affected system.



From this summary, security researchers could deduce whether any given vulnerability 
(specifically, the critical ones) could have been mitigated had admin rights been removed from 
the user.



In 2021, Microsoft shifted methodologies and moved to the Common Vulnerability Scoring 
System (CVSS). And in 2023, Microsoft continued to use CVSS 3\.1 scoring for their vulnerabilities, 
but began ranking severities based on Microsoft’s own Security Update Severity Rating System.



The CVSS methodology allows Microsoft’s vulnerabilities to be cross\-referenced more easily with 
third\-party bugs, simplifying some analysis, and Microsoft’s Security Update Severity Rating 
System allows each vulnerability to be rated according to the worst theoretical outcome, should 
that vulnerability be exploited.



An unfortunate trade\-off of this change, however, was the loss of the ability to determine the 
impact of admin rights on critical vulnerabilities.



Not only do the risks of excess privileged access remain very much intact, but privileged attack 
vectors are rapidly growing with the expansion of the cloud, and the proliferation of human and 
machine identities and accounts.



Thus, while the statistics on admin rights may be absent from this year’s report, it’s imperative 
that organizations don’t get complacent. Removal of admin rights remains a key piece of a least 
privilege strategy, as well as for enabling zero trust.

Accuracy of Vulnerability Data

A number of generalizations have been made for each vulnerability, as follows

 Each vulnerability was classified with the highest severity rating of all instances of that 

vulnerability where it appeared multiple times

 Each vulnerability was classified with the most prevalent type for all instances of that vulnerability
 Product versions were not taken into account
 Product combinations were not taken into account
 Vulnerabilities were counted for both the software and version where appropriate (for example,  
a vulnerability for Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 is taken as a vulnerability for both Microsoft  
Edge and Windows).
