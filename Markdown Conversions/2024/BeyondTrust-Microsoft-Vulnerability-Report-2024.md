Following our 10th anniversary edition, this year we are turning things up to 11 by asking one key question as we look across the Microsoft vulnerability landscape:

# Executive Summary

“Are organizations having an identity crisis?”

# Key Findings & Data Highlights
Through its 11 years in publication, the Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report has garnered over 16,000 downloads and helped thousands of users leverage its detailed data analysis and expert findings to improve their cyber defenses. 

This year’s edition of the report not only dissects the 2023 Microsoft vulnerabilities data, but also assesses how these vulnerabilities are being leveraged in identity-based attacks. The report also spotlights some of the most significant CVEs of 2023 (9.0+ CVSS severity scores), breaks down how they are leveraged by attackers, and explains how they can be mitigated.

A panel of some of the world’s leading cybersecurity experts will weigh in on the report findings as we collectively set our sights forward on emerging threats, new vulnerabilities, and how to best build cyber resilience across the enterprise and society at large.  

Read on to better understand, identify, and address the risks facing your organization within the Microsoft ecosystem.

- Total vulnerabilities continue their 4-year holding pattern near their highest-ever numbers.
- Elevation of Privilege vulnerability category continues to dominate.
- The total number of critical vulnerabilities continues its downward trend, but slowly.

While dropping slightly (by 5%) from 1,292 to 1,228 in 2023, total vulnerabilities have held firm near their all-time highs, remaining between 1,200 and 1,300 for the past four years (since 2020).
 
Continuing the trend in post-pandemic years, Elevation of Privilege accounted for 40% (490) of the total vulnerabilities in 2023.
 
Critical vulnerabilities dropped by 6% to 84 in 2023 (5 less than 2022).

## Key Findings
After hitting an all-time high in the number of reported Microsoft vulnerabilities in 2022, total reported vulnerabilities have slightly receded. 

Looking at the larger trend, the number of Microsoft vulnerabilities has plateaued since 2020.

## Data Highlights
- After Microsoft Azure & Dynamics 365 vulnerabilities skyrocketed in 2022, they almost halved in 2023 – down from 114 to 63
- Microsoft Edge experienced 249 vulnerabilities in 2023, only one of which was critical
- There were 522 Windows vulnerabilities in 2023, 55 of which were critical
- Microsoft Office experienced 62 vulnerabilities in 2023
- Windows Server category had 558 vulnerabilities in 2023, 57 of which were critical
- Denial of Service vulnerabilities climbed 51% to hit a record high of 109 in 2023, with Spoofing demonstrating a dramatic 190% increase, from 31 to 90.

## 5-Year Trend
Following the dramatic increase of Microsoft vulnerabilities in 2020, we have observed the total number of vulnerabilities plateauing over the past four years, with the range of fluctuations staying within a 7% window. 

Total vulnerabilities hit 1,228 in 2023, which represents a 5% decrease over the previous year, after hitting an all-time-high of 1,292 in 2022.

Total number of vulnerabilities have plateaued, remaining between 1,200 and 1,300 for the past four years.

Critical vulnerabilities continued their downward trend in 2023, but the pace has slowed.

A major source of risk for organizations everywhere, critical vulnerabilities, when exploited, have the potential to result in high-impact security events. These are the vulnerabilities that keep IT admins awake at night.

Similarly, critical vulnerabilities have remained steady, dipping slightly from 89 in 2022 to 84 in 2023. In terms of both total and critical vulnerabilities, this makes the past two years some of the most consistent we have seen since this report’s debut eleven years ago, with no major swings in the core data.

Looking at the distribution of critical vulnerabilities year over year, we observe a consistent downward trend. Windows Desktop and Server categories have both remained the main source of critical vulnerabilities through 2023. Given that they share a similar codebase, which represents a progressive evolution of the Windows NT Kernel, this is not a surprise.

As we discussed in last year’s report, there are areas of Windows operating systems with ~20-year-old, often long-forgotten code that can come back to haunt us—even on the latest versions of Windows. Over time, these risks have been steadily decreasing as the longtail of services and features have been refreshed. This plays a part in why we are seeing stability in the data today, which we will cover in greater depth below.

## What does stable vulnerabilities data tell us?
### Understanding Microsoft Critical Vulnerabilities
As we discussed in previous reports, an absence of sharp increases, as well as consistently decreasing numbers, are good indicators that many of Microsoft’s longer-term security efforts are paying off.

Legacy products, many of which were first developed before Microsoft introduced their Security Development Lifecycle in 2004, have come to End-of-Life (EOL), and newer, more secure operating systems and products have taken their place. Cloud technologies have matured, and those security investments have paid off.

Even looking back just three years, we see a starkly different picture. In 2020, critical vulnerability numbers were 133% higher than they were in 2023. While this year’s data hasn’t revealed as big a decrease in critical vulnerabilities as it has in previous years, the steady downward trend continues. This is a reassuring finding—especially for the IT practitioners who live and breathe the security of their Microsoft systems.

The total number of vulnerabilities are an important indicator of an environment’s health, but vulnerabilities are not created equal.

Some vulnerabilities may pose mostly theoretical risk (low likelihood and low impact) if they are exploited. On the opposite side of the spectrum, other vulnerabilities have high likelihoods of exploitation, and their exploitation may result in a highly negative impact to the affected organization(s).

Measuring a vulnerability’s level of impact relates to its impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data within a system or organization. The most severe vulnerabilities will impact all three of these basic tenets of information security.

Vulnerabilities categorized as ‘critical’ are those with characteristics that make their exploitation a potentially high-impact security event. The way Microsoft classifies the severity rating for a vulnerability is distinct from the likelihood of exploitation. 

However, the likelihood of exploitation is far more dynamic because attackers are more likely to exploit a known vulnerability.

Exploitation of ‘critical’ vulnerabilities will:

- Likely result in total compromise of a device or infrastructure.
- Have fewer prerequisites. Usually, the attack would not require any special access, privileges, or advanced knowledge.
- Allow code execution without user interaction. These generally do not rely on social engineering.

These types of vulnerabilities are what keep IT admins awake at night and are a major source of risk organizations everywhere must contend with.

Stable vulnerabilities data is a strong indicator that overall long-term security efforts are paying off.

## How does Microsoft classify critical vulnerabilities?
The National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD) Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) classifies critical vulnerabilities as those awarded a score of 9.0-10.0. The more enthusiastic readers of Microsoft’s vulnerability announcements may have noticed that, while Microsoft now uses CVSS 3.1 scoring for their vulnerabilities, they rank severities based on Microsoft’s own Security Update Severity Rating System. This rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome should that vulnerability be exploited.

This means that:

While 33 Microsoft vulnerabilities from 2023 scored a 9.0 or above (a 50% increase from 22 in 2022), making them “critical” under the National Vulnerability Database scoring system, Microsoft has classified 84 of its vulnerabilities as critical in 2023 (down 6% from 89 in 2022).

![The Microsoft Security Update Severity Rating System for identifying associated risk based on the worst theoretical outcome, if that vulnerability were to be exploited]

### Microsoft Security Update Rating System   |   Rating & Description
- **Critical**: A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution without user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or avoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email. Microsoft recommends that customers apply critical updates immediately.
- **Important**: A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where a client is compromised with warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt’s provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered. Microsoft recommends that customers apply important updates at the earliest opportunity.
- **Moderate**: Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations. Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update.
- **Low**: Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems.

### CVSS 3.1 Ratings
| Severity | Base Score Range |
| --- | --- |
| None | 0.0 |
| Low | 0.1 - 3.9 |
| Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 |
| High | 7.0 - 8.9 |
| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0 |

The difference between CVSS scoring and Microsoft’s severity rating system is worth noting, not only when considering the data in this report, but also when considering risk in your organization.

CVSS scores measure the technical severity of a vulnerability (i.e. whether a vulnerability results in some loss of data confidentiality or total loss of confidentiality). CVSS scoring does not measure the risk of that vulnerability. This means CVSS scores alone cannot tell you whether a vulnerability will cause a mission-critical impact on a system, or if the limited loss of some highly sensitive data would have a more severe impact than the total loss of non-sensitive data.

Microsoft’s severity rating system is potentially far more useful than a base or temporal CVSS score for security practitioners trying to prioritize risk reduction. However, it is important to know your own environment and risks so you can understand how best to prioritize patches and/or use other security hardening controls and mitigations.

All the data provided by Microsoft’s severity rating system is based on the information available at the time. It lacks the context of your own organization’s threat models. What is considered a critical patch for one organization may not be so for another organization—it all depends on the business context.

In addition to their Security Update Severity Rating System, Microsoft has also published an Exploitability Index to help customers understand the likelihood of exploitation. This can be useful information for those needing help with prioritization of security updates. As a word of caution, this information reflects the likelihood of exploitation at the time the security update was published. It may not reflect the real-world exploitability that develops in the following weeks or months as more threat actors weaponize the vulnerability. The index is best used for very short-term prioritization of updates, rather than as a justification to significantly delay patching.

![The Microsoft Exploitability Index for assessing the likelihood of exploitation at the time the security update was published]

### Microsoft Exploitability Index
| Index | Short Definition | Expanded Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation Detected | Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority. |
| 1 | Exploitation More Likely | Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore, more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority. |
| 2 | Exploitation Less Likely | Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority. |
| 3 | Exploitation Unlikely | Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be release that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from the vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release. |

# Vulnerabilities Data Deep Dive
## Vulnerabilities by Category
Each Microsoft Security Bulletin is comprised of one or more vulnerabilities, which apply to one or more Microsoft products. 

Microsoft typically groups vulnerabilities into these main categories: Remote Code Execution (RCE), Elevation of Privilege (EoP), Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DDoS), Spoofing, Tampering, and Security Feature Bypass.

Remote Code Execution and Elevation of Privilege remain the top vulnerability categories, once again highlighting familiar threat actor objectives.

- Elevation of Privilege remains the #1 vulnerability category, despite a significant 31% drop from 715 to 490 over the previous year.
- Remote Code Execution breaks its downward trend in 2023, increasing by 13% to 356, the highest number we’ve seen since this report’s debut.

### Elevation of Privilege remains the #1 vulnerability category in 2023
Elevation of Privilege has continued its post-2019 trend and remains the #1 category of vulnerability in 2023, followed by Remote Code Execution. This isn’t surprising as it parallels directly with known threat tactics.

Two primary threat actor tactics are:
- Getting their code to execute (https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/)
- Gaining access to the privileges needed to follow through on their objectives (https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/)

The good news this year is that, while Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities remain the #1 vulnerability category, they have decreased from 715 to 490—a substantive 31% drop. When we dive into the data, we can clearly see those reductions are primarily coming from reductions in Azure and Windows Server vulnerabilities, as shown in the figure below. 

This is welcome news, given that these systems are often public-facing and much more likely to contain large amounts of sensitive data and privileged service accounts than, for example, a Windows Desktop system.

In general, the reduction of Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities is a very positive trend that directly reduces a threat actor’s options when deploying a threat that requires elevated privileges to run. 

However, you can’t just rely on a lack of Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities to protect access to privileges. It is still essential to maintain a robust Privilege Access Management strategy to remove and secure privileges within an environment to prevent them from falling into the hands of an attacker.

Azure and Windows Server both show a significant reduction in EoP vulnerabilities. Azure dropped from 72 EoP vulnerabilities in 2022 down to 10 in 2023 (a massive 86% decrease), and Windows Server dropped from 191 to 141 (a 26% decrease).

### Remote Code Execution a close second to Elevation of Privilege in 2023
Coming in a close second place is the Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability category, which rose from 314 to 356 in 2023 (13% increase). While in many product areas, such as Azure, Office, and Windows (now mainly consisting of Windows 10 and 11 data), we have seen RCE decrease, this was offset this year by an increase on the Windows Server side.

The increase in Windows Server RCE vulnerabilities is not caused by one particular component, but is broadly spread across different services and features. In fact, many of these detections resulted from Microsoft’s increased collaboration with their security research community. Notably, it appears this collaboration is paying off because many of these vulnerabilities were disclosed directly to Microsoft and patched before they were publicly disclosed or observed being exploited in the wild.

Risk, reverse engineering, and researchers - the race continues.

Timely patches allow organizations to keep ahead of the majority of threat actors—provided organizations deploy the patches in a timely manner. Once a vulnerability is disclosed and patches are released, the race is on to successfully patch before a threat actor reverse engineers the patch or the vulnerability gets publicly disclosed, allowing for the creation of exploits in the wild.

Both researchers and threat actors have had success in reverse engineering patches to find exploitable workarounds or other vulnerabilities in recently patched areas of code. As the saying goes, there is no smoke without fire, and as we highlighted in last year’s report, vulnerabilities can start to snowball when attention is drawn to an area that might contain multiple exploitable areas of code.

Windows Server RCE vulnerabilities jumped from 142 to 169 in 2023, a 19% increase.

### Denial of Service and Spoofing vulnerabilities jump significantly in 2023
When thinking about information security, we often focus on ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data, but disrupting the availability of data can also have a devastating impact. Denial of Service (DoS) exploits can be used to disrupt the availability of data and cause challenges to business operations in a similar way as ransomware.

### What can we learn from this year’s vulnerabilities categories?
As overall vulnerabilities stabilize, threat actors shift focus to identities.

When it comes to getting code to run, threat actors have choices beyond exploiting vulnerabilities. They can use social engineering or stolen credentials to introduce their code into an environment without the need for a software vulnerability. Similarly, when it comes to elevating privileges, it might be easier to hijack an already-privileged account than exploit a software vulnerability or a misconfiguration in the environment to access the privileges required.

As the overall number of Microsoft vulnerabilities stabilizes and the number of critical vulnerabilities decreases, we see that attackers, much like water, will flow to the path of least resistance and focus much more of their attention on identities.

However, this doesn’t mean we can become complacent about software vulnerabilities. Not only are there plenty of vulnerabilities to go around, but there are also a number of unpatched systems still vulnerable to exploits that had patches made available months or years ago. These known vulnerabilities make it all too easy for threat actors to launch a successful attack.

Denial of Service vulnerabilities hit a record high in 2023, climbing 51%, from 72 in 2022 to 109 in 2023, with Spoofing demonstrating a dramatic 190% increase, from 31 in 2022 to 90 in 2023.

Overall, vulnerability numbers have stabilized. Total vulnerabilities continue a four-year plateau, and critical vulnerabilities continue to decline, although the descent has slowed.

Windows Server vulnerabilities increased slightly in 2023. Total vulnerabilities increased slightly from 552 to 558 (1%). Critical vulnerabilities saw a similarly slight increase, from 53 to 57.

The Windows vulnerability category showed a similar pattern, with total vulnerabilities increasing from 513 to 522 (2%), and critical vulnerabilities increasing from 49 to 55.

## Vulnerabilities by Product
Office and Edge continue to lead the way, and Azure course-corrects after a record-breaking vulnerability spike in 2022.

### Microsoft Edge continues downward vulnerability trend.
Chromium code base continues to offer significant security improvements, marked by a three-year plummet of vulnerabilities and exploits.

*2019-2021 includes Internet Explorer, which was discontinued last year. 2022/23 figures are Edge only

Web browsers and document viewers have historically been a major pain point when it comes to vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. Fortunately, Microsoft has made significant strides in maturing the security of these areas.

On the browser side, moving Edge away from a custom Microsoft codebase and over to a Chromium code base has yielded significant security improvements. Removing support for Internet Explorer has also helped, making drive-by download exploits and vulnerable Flash plugins a thing of the past.

Critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge have plummeted from 162 in 2017 to only 1 in 2023 (and 0 in 2022). This is largely due to the adoption of the security maturity offered by Chromium, which is used as the base for multiple web browsers.

### Microsoft Office vulnerabilities jump back up to 2019-2021 levels in 2023
On the Office side of the house, we have seen a similar (although not quite so dramatic) downward trend for both total and critical vulnerabilities, despite an increase in 2023. Again, this is partly due to some of the older versions of Office coming to End-of-Life (EoL) and no longer being supported.

Efforts to prevent common phishing and malware payloads via Office applications continue to force attackers to innovate. Controls introduced to disable macros from auto-running in downloaded documents have stymied some common paths to Remote Code Execution, forcing threat actors to look for more creative ways to run code using malicious documents and files.

One of the more interesting new areas for vulnerabilities within Office applications comes from Microsoft adding support for SketchUp Software’s proprietary SKP files in June 2022. This was designed to make it easier to import 3D models into Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Unfortunately, adding 3D file support to documents also introduced a new dimension to the vulnerability landscape, with the team at ThreatLabz discovering 117 unique vulnerabilities that got rolled up into CVE-2023-33146, CVE-2023-28285, and CVE-2023-29344.

Microsoft went on to create a patch to address these vulnerabilities, which the team at ThreatLabz was able to bypass. This resulted in Microsoft temporarily disabling support in Microsoft 365 for SketchUp files in June 2023.

While Microsoft has supported 3D file formats for a while now, this incident reinforces how any addition of new features can introduce security vulnerabilities. In this case, the additional code added to the MSOSPECTRE.DLL library, which is responsible for parsing 3D file formats, exposed vulnerabilities that Microsoft hadn’t anticipated.

Office vulnerabilities increase over 2022, but continue an overall downward-leaning trend, forcing attackers toward more innovative attack methods.

### Azure & Dynamics 365 vulnerabilities nearly halved in 2023.
After spiking in 2022, Azure & Dynamics 365 vulnerabilities saw an impressive 45% decrease from 114 to 63 in 2023.

After Microsoft Azure and Dynamics 365 vulnerabilities skyrocketed in 2022, they almost halved in 2023—down from 114 to 63. Considering the vast number of products and services this product area covers, the numbers are impressively low.

In last year’s report, we highlighted a cloud migration tool that caused a substantial proportion of the vulnerabilities largely associated with SQLi type vulnerabilities (who would have thought we would still be talking about SQLi today!). 

In 2023, this upward trend has course-corrected back to the level we would expect to see. This product area is predominantly newer code being developed entirely using the Microsoft Secure Development Lifecycle, and we can clearly see the benefits as compared to legacy products, which generally have higher rates of vulnerabilities.

# Vulnerabilities Spotlight
Understanding the methods threat actors are using to exploit vulnerabilities and infiltrate organizations can help you make more informed decisions to protect your organization.
## Print Spooler Snowball Slows
The goldrush of vulnerabilities—and prime targets for Elevation of Privilege attacks—may be nearing its end, but that doesn’t mean threat actors can’t still cash in.

### The Vulnerability Snowball Effect
This phenomenon occurs when one vulnerability is found and patched, but the process draws the fresh scrutiny of new researchers who find new vulnerabilities, new attack vectors, and new ways around previous patches—causing the vulnerability count to snowball.

The Print Spooler service, which contains code that is over 20 years old, is a poignant example of the vulnerability snowball effect in action.

- **2018**: “The Printer Bug” is identified. This bug allows an unprivileged user in the network to remotely trigger the Domain Controller’s Print Spooler service to authenticate to an arbitrary system. This bug allows the attacker to impersonate the Domain Controller.
- **2019**: “The Printer Bug” becomes CVE-2019-0683 and casts attention to the Print Spooler service.
- **2020**: Seven (7) Windows Print Spooler Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities are disclosed. Initially, these vulnerabilities are all local attack vectors, requiring the attacker to first have direct access to the system running the Print Spooler. However, the outcome of each is that an attacker could run arbitrary code with elevated system privileges.
  - CVE-2020-17042 Appears in late 2020. Unlike previous exploits that were locally exploitable, this one is remotely exploitable, meaning the attacker need only be on the network. This RCE attribute makes this particular vulnerability much more severe. However, this vulnerability had not been publicly disclosed and was not known to be used as an exploit in the wild before it was patched.
  - CVE-2020-1030
  - CVE-2020-1048
  - CVE-2020-1070
  - CVE-2020-1337
  - CVE-2020-17001
  - CVE-2020-17014
- **2021**: 16 Windows Print Spooler Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities are disclosed. The Print Spooler is now catching the eye of many researchers as an interesting way to perform Elevation of Privilege attacks. The number of disclosed Windows Print Spooler EoP vulnerabilities rapidly unspools as Microsoft plays Whack-A-Mole with researchers who have found ways around patches and continue to exploit vulnerabilities.
  - CVE-2021-34527 is the most noteworthy of the 2021 class of Windows Print Spooler EoP vulnerabilities. This vulnerability is very straightforward to exploit. A network needed little more than a valid user account and the Print Spooler to allow remote connections (which are enabled by default). The ease of exploit, combined with the fact it had been publicly disclosed and was actively being used in the wild, earned it the name “Print Nightmare.”
  - The other 15 such vulnerabilities in the 2021 class include: CVE-2021-41333, CVE-2021-41332, CVE-2021-40447, CVE-2021-38671, CVE-2021-38667, CVE-2021-36970, CVE-2021-36958, CVE-2021-36947, CVE-2021-36936, CVE-2021-34483, CVE-2021-34481, CVE-2021-26878, CVE-2021-1695, CVE-2021-1675, and CVE-2021-1640.
- **2022**: 35 Windows Print Spooler Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities are disclosed, more than doubling what was recorded the previous year.
  - CVE-2022-44681, CVE-2022-44678, CVE-2022-41073, CVE-2022-38028, CVE-2022-38005, CVE-2022-35793, CVE-2022-30226, CVE-2022-30206, CVE-2022-30138, CVE-2022-29140, CVE-2022-29132, CVE-2022-29114, CVE-2022-29104, CVE-2022-26803, CVE-2022-26802, CVE-2022-26801, CVE-2022-26798, CVE-2022-26797, CVE-2022-26796, CVE-2022-26795, CVE-2022-26794, CVE-2022-26793, CVE-2022-26792, CVE-2022-26791, CVE-2022-26790, CVE-2022-26789, CVE-2022-26787, CVE-2022-26786, CVE-2022-23284, CVE-2022-22718, CVE-2022-22717, CVE-2022-22041, CVE-2022-22022, CVE-2022-21999, and CVE-2022-21997
- **2023**: 5 Windows Print Spooler Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities are disclosed, a significant reduction over previous years.
  - CVE-2023-35325, CVE-2023-35302, CVE-2023-21765, CVE-2023-21760, CVE-2023-21678

In last year’s report, we talked about the snowball effect around Windows Print Spooler vulnerabilities, where the over 20-year-old code that had been passed down through versions of Windows had started to show its age and become a target for exploits. Print Spooler vulnerabilities had roughly doubled in number every year since the 2019 discovery of “The Printer Bug” CVE-2019-0683, peaking in 2022 with 35 vulnerabilities.

As encouraging as it is to see the volume reduce, these are not insignificant vulnerabilities, and the majority are associated with Elevation of Privilege. Given that the print spooler service runs as SYSTEM (the highest level of privilege within the Windows OS), it is a prime target for Elevation of Privilege exploits.

Unlike previous years, it appears Microsoft managed to issue patches before any of these vulnerabilities were publicly disclosed or exploited in the wild. This provides some reassurance that lessons in this area have been learned, but still demonstrates that now is not the time to get complacent.

Many Microsoft products met an End-of-Life (EOL) fate in 2023. This means that they will no longer receive security patches to address vulnerabilities or other issues.

Notable this year is the EOL of Server 2012 and Server 2012R2. As a parting gift, both server operating systems received a retirement package of 65 patches, with 11 of those being critical. To incentivize cloud migrations to Azure for those still using these operating systems, Microsoft is offering three years of Extended Security Updates (ESUs) beyond the end of the support date (Oct 2023) on Azure.

At the other end of Microsoft’s Extended Security Updates (ESU) program is Windows 7. The OS you probably already thought was long gone is now no longer covered by Microsoft’s ESU program. Since this means no more access to critical security patches, it’s definitely time to accelerate plans to move any legacy Windows 7 systems forward.

This goldrush seems to have now settled down to a mere five vulnerabilities in 2023: CVE-2023-35325, CVE-2023-35302, CVE-2023-21765, CVE-2023-21760, CVE-2023-21678

End-of-Life (EOL) software is no longer supported or patched, making it an elevated risk to organizations and a prime target for threat actors.

Time to say “goodbye”

There were also a few products that, much like the Microsoft Zune mp3 player, failed to really take off, and have been retired without much attention. So, in 2023, we said farewell to Microsoft Kaizala. Your 2G network-optimized secure messaging is now part of Teams and has been forced to retire.

While we are continuing to celebrate an all-time low of critical vulnerabilities across Microsoft products, there are still some eyebrow-raising critical vulnerabilities that struck fear into the hearts of IT professionals in 2023.

Unlike many past vulnerabilities, CVE-2023-23397 in Microsoft Outlook requires no user interaction to trigger the exploit. Worse still, the vulnerability impacted all versions of Microsoft Outlook for Windows and allowed an attacker to gain sensitive Windows New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) credential hashes. This dangerous combination of ease of exploitability and high impact resulted in a base CVSS score of 9.8, which is more than enough to get the attention of IT administrators and threat actors alike.

The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker sends a specially crafted calendar invite or appointment to a target victim’s email address. This invite contains additional properties that cause Outlook to make an SMB connection and trigger NTLM authentication to a server on the internet that is under the attacker’s control. From there, the attacker can capture the NTLM hashes and use them to authenticate themselves as the victim, leading to potential escalation of privileges and further compromise of the environment.

The real danger is that the underlying vulnerability is triggered without the user having to open the invite at all. In fact, the trigger is the reminder notification sound. 

While this is usually a predictable “ping” sound to remind you a meeting is about to happen, there is a “PidL
