## Mission Statement
The Google Cloud Threat Horizons Report provides 
decision-makers with strategic intelligence about 
threats to cloud enterprise users, along with cloud-
specific research, based on intelligence-derived threat 
actor trends and expertise from Google Cloud security 
leaders and practitioners. Most importantly, the report 
delivers recommendations on mitigating these risks 
and improving cloud security posture from Google’s 
intelligence and security teams, including Google Cloud’s 
Office of the CISO, Google’s Threat Analysis Group, 
Mandiant, and various Google Cloud product teams.

## Executive Summary
New year, new cloud threat insights 
create informed opportunities for 
actionable cloud security defenses

This iteration of the Google Cloud Threat Horizons 
Report provides a forward-thinking view of cloud 
security with intelligence on emerging threats and 
actionable recommendations from Google’s security 
experts. This report explores top cloud threats and 
security concerns for 2024, including credential abuse, 
cryptomining, ransomware, and data theft.

In 2023, threats increased in number and 
sophistication targeting all IT environments—
on-premise, mobile, IT/OT, and the cloud. Issues 
specific to cloud providers were often due to 
security hygiene or misconfigurations rather than 
underlying vulnerabilities. We saw threat actors 
evolve their methods for abusing and monetizing 
cloud infrastructure, gaining initial access to cloud 
networks, conducting cloud-based supply chain 
attacks, and running malicious operations from cloud 
environments.

Based on our research and analysis, the following 
areas should inform cloud customer security 
strategies in 2024:
*   Credential abuse resulting in cryptomining remains 
a persistent issue, with threat actors continuing 
to exploit weak or nonexistent passwords to gain 
unauthorized access to cloud instances, while 
some threat actors are shifting to broader threat 
objectives.
*   Ransomware and data theft remain a concern 
in all IT environments, including on-premise and 
cloud, as threat actors are continuously evolving 
their methods for conducting ransomware and data 
theft attacks—making robust data loss prevention 
strategies more essential than ever before.
*   Increased focus on security event logging is 
necessary to address threat actors’ evolving 
tactics of manipulation and deleting logs. Threat 
actors are increasingly targeting security event 
logging software in novel ways to disrupt and evade 
detection.
*   People’s Republic of China (PRC)-affiliated 
espionage threat actors are increasingly targeting 
cloud services and infrastructure given the 
enhanced adoption of cloud across industries 
globally.

The cloud threats and security issues identified in 2023 
will likely continue this year as threat actors seek new 
ways to bypass security measures, breach customer 
cloud projects, move laterally, access sensitive data, 
refine proven techniques, and explore new tactics 
using Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Looking ahead, high-profile global events in 2024 
(e.g. elections worldwide, the Summer Olympics, 
regional conflicts in multiple regions, etc.) will continue 
to serve as attractive targets for threat actors seeking 
novel ways for conducting malicious activities like 
information operations, espionage, and other cyber 
campaigns to achieve their objectives. As such, weak 
points within customer cloud projects will likely be 
among the top methods attackers utilize to achieve 
their objectives. We will continue leveraging our 
threat intelligence and insights to identify actionable 
risk mitigations to help organizations enhance their 
cloud security.

The following sections dive deeper into the key 
takeaways from these cloud threat insights to better 
enable mitigations for the year to come.

## Cryptomining Remains the Dominant Consequence of Weak Cloud Configurations
Credential issues remain the predominant security 
oversight observed among Google Cloud customers. 
Over half of incident data shows that threat actors 
are compromising Cloud instances with weak or no 
passwords on common remote access protocols, 
Secure Shell (SSH) and Remote Desktop Protocol 
(RDP), to gain unauthorized access to Cloud instances. 
This provides threat actors with easy access to 
compromised cloud resources, which they can 
monetize by selling access, often for a couple of 
dollars per credential pair. Given that harvesting such 
credentials is low-effort for a threat actor, this trend 
will likely continue to affect organizations that fail to 
meet basic standards of security.

Cryptomining remained one of the principal 
motivations behind threat actors who abused cloud 
access, accounting for nearly two-thirds of observed 
activity. This quick and easy money maker serves 
a clear profit motive for criminal actors, as it allows 
threat actors to use a victim’s cloud processing 
power to mine for cryptocurrency in a shorter 
period of time. However, this dominance, cited in 
the Threat Horizons Report throughout 2023, risks 
overshadowing an insidious trend. Several times 
throughout 2023, we observed threat actors leverage 
illicit cloud access in an attempt to infect third parties. 
This less common tactic, constituting over 25% of 
observed incidents, has significant security impacts 
for organizations on both sides of the attack. For an 
organization unwittingly hosting malicious activity, 
the risks range from reputational harm, to monetary 
costs and operational disruption. Even though major 
cloud platforms invest heavily in security and in abuse 
detection and mitigation, organizations should 
monitor their own cloud computing resources for 
suspicious activity to best align billing monitoring and 
security needs.

These complexities make using cloud resources for 
malicious purposes convenient for threat actors, 
and highlights the need for organizations to ensure 
they are taking steps to protect themselves. Google 
Cloud offers a variety of security features to support 
customers and protect their environments from 
credential abuse, including providing the following:
*   2FA: Google Cloud currently requires 2FA for all 
administrative users, which adds an additional layer 
of security to protect accounts from unauthorized 
access.
*   Strong password policies: Google Cloud enforces 
strong password policies, requiring passwords 
to be at least 12 characters long and to include a 
mix of letters, numbers, and symbols; additionally 
there are other features, including passwordless 
authentication which eliminates the need for 
passwords altogether.
*   IAM policies: IAM policies can be used to control 
who has access to resources in Google Cloud, and 
what they can do with those resources.
*   Cloud Audit Logs: Cloud Audit Logs track all activity 
in Google Cloud, which can be used to monitor 
for suspicious activity and to investigate security 
incidents.
*   Security Command Center: Security Command 
Center provides a centralized view of security 
threats and vulnerabilities in Google Cloud. It can 
be used to detect and respond to security incidents 
quickly and efficiently.

The document includes two pie charts, the first titled "2023 Cloud Compromises: Initial Access" showing the following percentages: Weak or no password (51.1%), Leaked credentials (17.3%), Other (13.7%), Vulnerable software (11.5%), Sensitive UI or API exposed (2.9%), Misconfiguration (3.6%). The second pie chart is titled "2023 Cloud Compromises: Impact" showing the following percentages: Coin mining (65.4%), Intrusion attempt (26.0%), Account leaked credentials (5.8%), DOS (2.8%), Other (0%).

### Mitigations
*   Lock down SSH, RDP, and any other known remote 
access software with organization-level policy 
controls on GCP. Google Cloud’s Enterprise 
foundations blueprint with best practices guidance 
suggests creating a custom VPC network for 
production workloads rather than relying on the 
default network with pre-populated rules which 
expose SSH and RDP among other services. Control 
administrative access to virtual machines via 
Identity Aware Proxy. 
*   Use Essential Contacts to ensure every cloud 
service used by an organization has point of contact 
(POC) information updated so cloud providers can 
reach impacted clients promptly.
*   Monitor cloud resource utilization, and establish 
alerts for anomalous events, such as sudden spikes 
in new virtual machines. 
*   Consider leveraging Security Command Center to 
detect CPU/memory spikes related to cryptomining 
activity and other potential malicious outbound 
network connections. Reimbursement for 
undetected cryptomining attacks is available to 
Premium customers.  
*   Reassess your cloud incident response and 
reconstitution plan.

## Strengthen Security to Counter Ransomware Attacks and Data Theft in the Cloud
This article covers both Google Cloud and cloud 
service provider agnostic threats. Threat actors 
continued targeting unprotected public cloud storage 
services, misconfigured networks, and weak cloud 
storage naming conventions for ransomware and data 
exfiltration in 2023, and we anticipate that this trend 
will continue further into 2024. As this type of activity 
gains additional prominence, it is imperative that 
defenders strengthen cloud asset management and 
data protection.

While weak credentials and misconfigurations are 
often causes for a threat actor’s initial access to cloud 
environments, other factors, such as weak storage 
defenses, application vulnerabilities, and third-party 
issues also led to system compromises, resulting in 
ransomware and data theft (Figure 1).

The document includes a graphic titled "Figure 1: Common Causes of Ransomware and Data Theft in the Cloud" which is a list of common causes:
*   Misconfigurations and errors in cloud application and system security settings (E.g., Unrestricted ports, excessive user privileges)
*   Weak storage defenses (E.g., Anticipated bucket naming conventions)
*   Application vulnerabilities (E.g., Zero-day exploits)
*   Third-party issues (E.g., Software supply chain risk, insufficient access management)
*   Weak credentials (E.g., Default or lack of passwords in cloud applications and systems)

Notable incidents and threat actor activity include:
*   Suspected Rhysida ransomware actors allegedly 
breached Slovenia’s largest power provider, Holding 
Slovenske Elektrarne, by stealing passwords 
for systems from an unprotected cloud storage 
instance in Nov. 2023.
*   Threat actors conducted a ransomware attack 
resulting in lost customer data on cloud-hosting 
firms CloudNordic and AzeroCloud in Aug. 2023 
when the firm’s servers were misconfigured during 
a data center migration.

The document includes a graphic titled "Figure 2: Model of a Cloud Storage Bucket Naming Convention Exploited by a Threat Actor" which is a diagram showing the following steps:
1.  Engineer creates buckets *data1 and *data2 using App and users begin storing data in them
2.  Attacker anticipates bucket names *data3 and *data4 and creates them using App
3.  App needs to use buckets and identifies buckets *data3 and *data4 and begins storing data in them
4.  Attacker uses owner access to buckets *data3 and *data4 to exfiltrate data

*   Google Cloud Storage (GCS) team observations 
indicate threat actors are probing weak cloud 
storage bucket naming conventions to exfiltrate 
data (Figure 2). Uncategorized threat actors have 
attempted to use a bucket naming approach that 
would allow them to anticipate which specific 
bucket would most likely be used next by a user. 
This could allow threat actors to precreate buckets 
in which data is stored by users and then exfiltrate 
data immediately after users store it. See previous 
iteration of THR for insights on additional tactics 
used by threat actors against cloud storage.

### Some Extortion Groups Moving to Server-side Exploits
Rather than focusing on weak cloud credentials 
to gain initial access, some multifaceted extortion 
groups groups are shifting from using client-side to 
server-side exploits in incidents across multiple cloud 
providers. In 2023, Cl0p threat actors exploited at least 
three server-side zero-days and other ransomware 
groups exploited server-side bugs as n-days.

Notable incidents and threat actor activity include:
*   In Nov. 2023, Cl0p actors exploited a now-patched 
zero-day in IT asset management software, SysAid, 
and then issued commands via SysAid to install 
Gracewire malware on additional hosts.
*   Mandiant observed Cl0p actors engage in 
widespread exploitation of a now-patched zero-day 
in the MOVEit Transfer secure managed file transfer 
software in June 2023. The actors deployed the 
LEMURLOOT webshell for data theft, after which the 
CL0P^_-LEAKS data leak site claimed responsibility 
for attacks.
*   In April 2023, Cl0p actors and associated initial 
access brokers exploited a now-patched zero-day 
in print management software PaperCut to drop 
TrueBot malware. After PaperCut released a patch, 
other groups, including the Bl00dy Ransomware 
Gang, exploited the bug as an n-day. 
*   In April 2023, ALPHV/Blackcat ransomware-as-a-
service affiliates compromised victims in cases 
where access was obtained via an exploited n-day in 
GoAnywhere MFT for initial access.

### Threat Actors Prioritizing Data Exfiltration Over Data Encryption
Threat actors targeting cloud environments began 
prioritizing data exfiltration over data encryption 
and stolen data advertisements grew in 2023, as 
threat actors demonstrated an increased focus on 
publicly releasing exfiltrated data from multiple cloud 
providers.

This could suggest that threat actors are increasingly 
seeking to profit by selling the data (or access to the 
data) rather than expecting victims to pay the ransom 
for decryption keys.
*   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 
(TSMC) confirmed a data breach originating 
from a partner cloud computing company, 
Kinmax Technologies, conducted by the Lockbit 
ransomware gang, who posted TSMC data on their 
leak site with a $70 million USD extortion demand in 
July 2023. Lockbit threatened to destroy the data or 
make it publicly downloadable.

### Threat Actors Likely to Continue Adapting Methods for Ransomware and Data Theft
In 2023 a number of threat actors adapted their 
tools for conducting ransomware attacks and stealing 
data in the cloud, which we assess will likely continue 
in 2024.
*   Ransomware developers created Linux variants and 
ransomware builds specific to VMWare ESXi. As of 
Nov. 2023, Kinsing hackers were exploiting the Linux 
Privilege Escalation Flaw (CVE-2023-4911) to gather 
industry-wide cloud service provider credentials 
and expose sensitive data in cloud environments.
*   Mandiant Intelligence identified more than 
100 tools—from backdoors, downloaders, and 
ransomware—that are either targeted or have the 
capability to leverage cloud-related technologies for 
command-and-control (C2), payload hosting, and/or 
data exfiltration.
*   Threat actors exfiltrated stolen data from—and 
sent stolen data to—public cloud storage platforms 
when conducting ransomware attacks. In early 2023, 
PLAYCRYPT ransomware threat actors leveraged 
stolen credentials to gain access to a victim’s 
network and use the RDP to move laterally across 
multiple systems. After identifying and staging 
data in multiple file archives in the victim’s cloud 
environment, the threat actors exfiltrated the data 
and subsequently encrypted the file archives.

### Mitigations
We recommend multiple approaches for Google Cloud 
customers to help prevent ransomware and data theft 
in their cloud environments, including:
*   Follow Google Cloud and industry best practices 
for cloud asset risk management, including Cloud 
Asset Inventory services, Identity and Access 
Management, and the Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM). 
*   Establish a cloud-specific backup strategy with 
testing that includes configurations and templates 
of stored assets, not solely backups of data or 
machine state. 
*   Use technologies, such as WORM (Write Once 
Read Many), or the Bucket Lock feature on Google 
Cloud to provide immutable and policy compliant 
backup storage.
*   Implement resilient architecture, such as multi-
region cloud use and backup mirroring, to reduce 
risk of data loss or inaccessibility. 
*   Encrypt all backups, which Google Cloud Storage 
does by default. Google Cloud customers can add 
an additional layer of encryption by using customer-
managed encryption keys (CMEK). Segregate key 
access roles to help prevent attackers from being 
able to read backups.
*   Configure sensitive data protection with Cloud Data 
Loss Prevention and use Cloud Backup and Disaster 
Recovery service to backup your cloud data for 
recovery in the instance of an attack.
*   Incorporate controls on known exploited 
vulnerabilities and misconfigurations linked to 
ransomware by leveraging Google Cloud Threat 
Intelligence for Chronicle and VirusTotal and 
following guidance from the U.S. Dept. of Homeland 
Security, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
Agency’s Ransomware Vulnerability Pilot (RVWP).

## Don’t Get Caught in the Dark: Shining Light with Logs
In 2023, threat actors targeted security event 
logging software in all IT environments in a number 
of novel ways that evade detection, underscoring 
the importance of comprehensive logging practices.  
Robust logging practices are fundamental to an 
organization’s security posture, and are becoming 
more sought out in cloud environments, as network 
defenders realize the potential value in collecting 
and gathering as much data as possible to 
reconstruct attacks.

Similar to network defenders, threat actors are 
continuously learning and adapting their Tactics, 
Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) in the cloud. 
Mandiant’s M-Trends 2023 (page 43) reports that 
clearing logs or traces of attacker activity was among 
the fifth most frequent technique observed. Sophos 
similarly reported (page 9) that network defenders 
and incident responders were missing telemetry 
for nearly 50% of the incidents due to threat actors 
disabling protection and approximately 40% of the 
time logs were cleared, leaving no evidence for 
analysis and mitigation.

Implementing a security event logging solution can 
support establishing baseline activity in logging to 
subsequently detect anomalous behavior. Maintaining 
strong logging practices provides organizations with 
greater visibility into their cloud environments and 
activities, which can help to triage, identify, detect, 
and mitigate threats more quickly. Moreover, the 
visibility, contextual and historical background related 
to the activity allows defenders to observe how threat 
actors work to disable or tamper with logs to cover 
their tracks. Lack of logs can result in slowing down or 
preventing network defenders from mitigating threats 
in a timely manner. The complimentary and prominent 
role compliance has in cloud security logging  is 
further supported by compliance requirements, 
international standards, and government and 
international regulations. 

Threat actors are taking aim at logging systems to 
avoid the defender’s gaze and this intent underscores 
the importance of exporting logs to a secure and 
centralized location. According to M-Trends 2023 
(page 75) as well as a report from CISA (page 12), the 
criminal threat actor group UNC3661 (also known as 
Lapsus$) has been observed taking active steps to 
remove or disable security monitoring tools such as 
endpoint detection and response (EDR) tooling. The 
lack of logs generated from these telemetry sources 
should be an indicator in itself to defenders where a 
stream of information that was expected is no longer 
generating logs. 

Mandiant also notes in the M-Trends 2023 report that 
the Lockbit ransomware has been observed clearing 
event logs prior to encrypting files. This results in 
limited visibility into how the attackers gained initial 
access and deployed the ransomware, what other 
malware may have been deployed but not found, and 
other attempts of lateral movement or persistence in 
the environment. In the Google Cloud Cybersecurity 
Forecast 2024 we expect that the use of wipers will be 
adopted by a greater number of threat actors which 
alongside other system files will likely remove on-
device logs.

When managing logs in the cloud, some logs are 
enabled by default and cannot be disabled, such 
as Admin Activity and System Event audit logs 
while other logs have cost implications and require 
customers to enable and configure, such as Data 
Access audit logs and network logs. Additionally, 
it’s important to consider the retention period of 
logs to assure key insights will be available and not 
automatically lost when required during an incident. 
Guidance for which types of logs to enable exists 
from various sources and is linked in the mitigations 
section below, but in general, can include telemetry 
from endpoints, application logs, network logs, and 
Cloud logs. By default, Google Cloud customers 
have access to all logs that are generated by their 
Google Cloud resources. This includes logs from 
applications, services, and infrastructure. Customers 
can also choose to export logs to other services, 
including Cloud Storage or BigQuery. Significantly, 
the security event logging capability also includes 
pre-built dashboards and reports intended to support 
organizations in identifying and responding to 
threats. Further, Google Cloud offers a variety of log 
management tools that help organizations to store, 
archive, and analyze security logs.

The observations from threat actor behavior, along 
with the requirements of regulations and compliance 
guidance from organizations such as NIST, CISA, and 
NSA communicate the urgency of enabling, properly 
configuring, and monitoring logs. Organizations 
should prioritize logging in 2024 and leverage the 
capabilities of the Cloud to detect threats quicker—
safeguarding their data and customers. Lastly, it 
needs to be highlighted that in addition to logging all 
security events, it is equally as important to log other 
relevant information, such as network traffic, user 
activity, and system changes. This information can help 
organizations to better understand their environments 
and identify potential security risks by establishing 
baseline behavior to measure against future activity.

### Mitigations
*   Identify relevant logs to collect and monitor 
as outlined from Google Cloud’s MITRE ATT&CK 
mapping of Google Cloud logs, NIST SP 800-92 
(draft of new revision), NSA’s Volt Typhoon threat 
hunting, or Mandiant’s blog post covering Cloud logs 
with example attacker path scenarios. 
*   Export logs to a centralized, well-governed 
repository to make it easier to monitor the 
environment as a whole but also reduce the risk of 
losing visibility when threat actors delete logs or 
disable user-configured cloud logs. 
    *   Protect centralized logs by adding protections 
against project deletion with a Project Lien 
and increasing the retention on logs for longer 
visibility.
    *   Leverage Security Command Center’s Security 
Health Analytics to detect data access audit 
logs being disabled or review IAM permissions 
for high-sensitivity roles such to change logging 
settings.
    *   Securely configure IAM permissions so only 
key individuals have access to change logging 
settings, which are considered a high-sensitivity 
role.  
*   Monitor for missing logs. Organizations should 
monitor for the lack of telemetry due to log 
deletion or endpoint protection being disabled. 
Leveraging a cloud-native SIEM and SOAR like 
Chronicle Operations Suite will help with ingesting 
and normalizing log data and automate alerting. 
Community Security Analytics also hosts pre-built 
queries for organizations to manually search for 
threats.
*   Assure sensitive information is not available 
to threat actors with access to logs. Similar to 
defenders, threat actors can glean insights into 
a target’s environment from logs with sensitive 
information.
    *   Google Cloud’s Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) 
can regularly scan data and can help prevent 
sensitive information from falling into the hands 
of attackers.
    *   Ensure sensitive data, such as passwords or user 
data, isn’t written to application logs.
    *   Consider tools such as TruffleHog to help find 
credentials stored in file systems, containers, and 
cloud storage.

## Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Actors In Cloud Architecture Spotlight: People’s Republic of China (PRC)
Throughout 2023, the People’s Republic of China 
(PRC) has increasingly targeted cloud infrastructure, 
a trend highlighted by the activities of a few nation-
state backed Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 
actors. The TTPs, particularly those focused on 
“Living-off-the-Land” (LOTL) tactics, have enabled 
threat actors to blend into normal network activities, 
evading detection. These actions align with the PRC’s 
overarching goal of creating a Digital China. The PRC’s 
Digital China strategy, which as of 2023 was largely 
new to Western audiences, has evolved over the past 
decade to encompass most of the world. China’s 
Digital Strategy is supported by long standing Belt & 
Road Initiatives, both economic and infrastructure 
related projects spans the world, including the African 
and South American continents, laying the groundwork 
for greater interconnectedness worldwide. 

Threat actors affiliated with the People’s Liberation 
Army (PLA), the Ministry of State Security (MSS) and 
other contractors that may be affiliated with a defense 
entity have undergone a significant evolution over 
the past three decades. The cybersecurity landscape 
currently faces a critical challenge with the emergence 
of highly resilient botnet operations operated by PRC 
state-sponsored threat actors who relentlessly scan 
for vulnerabilities in computer systems vital to our daily 
lives so that threat actors can exploit them.

### Sophisticated Evasion in Cloud Infrastructure: PRC’s New Paradigm
A number of PRC-nexus threat actors have shown a 
high proficiency in exploiting vulnerabilities associated 
with cloud services, infrastructure, targeting virtual 
machines, and related cloud architecture, as evident 
in several sophisticated campaigns in 2023. In an 
operation described by Unit 42, PRC nexus APT 
infrastructure masqueraded as cloud backup services 
via typosquatting, primarily targeting Cambodian 
government organizations. In its report, Unit 42 
observed a total of 24 Cambodian government 
organizations communicating with this infrastructure 
between September and October 2023. These 
organizations mostly focused on critical services 
including those in defense, government, legal, 
financial, telecommunications and natural resources.

### The Case of UNC3236 aka Volt Typhoon
Google Cloud security partners track this threat as 
UNC3236, a PRC-nexus threat  actor active since at 
least 2021, and characterized by cyber espionage and 
intelligence gathering. DHS CISA and Microsoft state 
that this actor is targeting US critical infrastructure, 
with the goal of gathering intelligence and disrupting 
operations, often targeting critical services in 
industries such as defense, government, legal, finance, 
telecommunications, and natural resources. 

UNC3236 operations and campaigns have successfully 
evaded traditional EDR primarily because it is able 
to conduct operations without the use of malware, 
often using legitimate services and applications 
for lateral movement once in the network. They 
accomplish this by surreptitiously repurposing 
end-of-life commercial and residential routers to 
set up various obfuscation networks. 

The challenge in detecting and tracking these covert 
networks is that after initial access is achieved, the 
corresponding C2 communications can be extremely 
challenging to detect. The volume of C2 traffic may 
be minimal if the persistent access was in and of itself 
the primary goal. A number of these covert networks 
were established by surreptitiously repurposing end of 
life commercial and residential routers in order to set 
up a Tor-like covert data transfer network to conduct 
malicious operations. A number of these end of life 
devices lack security updates, turning them into 
pivotal components in the actor’s penetration strategy. 
Specific characteristics of this adversary and its pat­
terns of behaviors include the following observations 
relevant to cloud infrastructure, including:
*   Proxies network traffic through compromised 
commercial and residential network edge devices. 
These covert networks make it more difficult to 
trace activity back to the original source.
*   Uses custom versions of open-source tools to 
establish a command and control (C2) channel over 
proxy. This allows them to communicate with each 
other and exfiltrate data undetected.
*   Attempts to create installation media from domain 
controllers, either remotely or locally. This gives the 
threat actor access to usernames and password 
hashes, which they can use to gain further access to 
the network and move laterally.
*   Living-off-The-Land binary (LOLBins) commands to 
find information on the system, discover additional 
devices on the network, and exfiltrate data. This can 
be done without the use of malware, making it even 
more difficult to detect.

In January 2023, Mandiant, first reported publicly that 
threat actors affiliated with the PRC are responsible 
for a series of cyber espionage operations that have 
targeted internet-facing devices. Google Cloud has 
also observed PRC targeting of cloud environments, 
leveraging tactics that allow threat actors to blend 
in with normal network traffic, making detection 
challenging. Given historical campaigns and 
operations, and current geopolitical tensions, 
Google Cloud sees UNC3236 as a growing threat to 
cloud users in 2024.

Google Cloud has proactively implemented security 
measures to counter the threat posed by malicious 
actors that share sophisticated capabilities similar to 
those discussed here. Efforts in enhancing monitoring 
systems, leveraging advanced threat detection, and 
promoting industry collaboration are instrumental 
in strengthening infrastructure and services against 
sophisticated cyber threats. 

### The Case of Storm 0588
Most recently, in July 2023, Microsoft’s Storm-0558 
campaign demonstrated another sophisticated aspect 
of the apparatus: several agencies, and departments 
within the PRC and CCP focus on possible 
vulnerabilities and risks within cloud infrastructure 
and services.  The campaign involved the use of 
forged tokens to access the email systems of about 
25 entities, including government agencies and public 
cloud consumer accounts.

Key findings by DHS CISA, an affected U.S. government 
agency “identified suspicious activity by leveraging 
enhanced logging—specifically of MailItemsAccessed 
events—and an established baseline of normal Outlook 
activity, such as AppID.” The MailItemsAccessed event 
logging enabled detection of otherwise difficult to 
detect adversarial activity. Investigations uncovered 
that on May 15, 2023, the threat actor began using an 
acquired Microsoft account (MSA) key to forge tokens 
to access Outlook Web Access in Exchange Online 
(OWA) and Outlook.com domain.

The Microsoft Exchange was impacted by a 
vulnerability that caused it to accept Azure AD 
authentication tokens as valid even though they were 
signed by an Acquired Microsoft Account (MSA) 
signing key to gain access to enterprise accounts. 
This vulnerability occurred as a result of an incident 
related to internal default settings. Microsoft clarified 
that this occurred as a result of a missing validation 
functionality in the Software Developer Kit (SDK). At 
some point in 2022, the development team tasked 
with authentication in Exchange incorrectly assumed 
that the Azure AD SDK performed issuer validation 
by default. This caused validation to be implemented 
incorrectly, leading to the exploited vulnerability.

While the timing of the targeting is consistent with 
espionage-related objectives, as well as the U.S. 
Secretary of State’s visit to China, Google security 
partners concur with Microsoft’s assessment 
that the most likely objective of this threat actor is 
that of a well resourced and sophisticated cyber 
espionage actor.

### Mitigations
In addressing the complex challenges posed by 
sophisticated nation-state cyber threats, notably 
from actors associated with the People’s Republic of 
China, cloud service providers and their customers 
must adopt a multifaceted and proactive approach to 
cybersecurity. These should consist of:
*   Security by Design; Safe by Default; Security in 
Deployment. Security by design and secure by 
default are approaches to building software that are 
meant to be inherently secure. Security by design 
means that security is built into the system from the 
ground up, with a focus on preventing vulnerabilities 
and attacks. Safe by default means that the system 
is configured in a way that is as secure as possible 
by default, with the user having to take action to 
make it less secure. Security in deployment offers 
continuous assurance that controls are deployed 
as they should be. Google Cloud provides tooling 
and capabilities to integrate with customized cloud 
environments to support assurances that your 
security, risk, and compliance levels are consistently 
sustained. This allows cloud environment to operate 
with confidence that threats from ransomware, 
account takeovers, bots, phishing, and even more 
advanced attacks, are minimized, 
*   Leverage Chronicle Cybershield. As part of 
Chronicle CyberShield, GCP government customers 
can leverage cyber threat intelligence from Google 
and Mandiant to build a scalable and centralized 
threat intelligence and analysis capability. This is 
integrated operationally into the government SOC to 
identify suspicious indicators and enrich the context 
for known vulnerabilities. Chronicle CyberShield 
allows governments to build a coordinated 
monitoring capability with Chronicle SIEM to simplify 
threat detection, investigation, and hunting with the 
intelligence, speed, and hyperscale of Google.
*   Defense in Depth Approach. Defense in depth is 
when you have multiple complementary controls, 
failsafes, and redundancies, so that if one control 
fails, operational integrity is maintained. Defense 
in Depth and zero trust approach is based on the 
notion that trusting any single component in a 
complex system can be dangerous. Therefore, it is 
essential to verify trust through multiple means and 
on an ongoing basis. This strategy provides robust 
defense against sophisticated cyberattacks. 
*   Cloud Key Management Service. Cloud Key 
Management Service (Cloud KMS) lets you create 
and manage encryption keys for use in compatible 
Google Cloud services and in your own applications. 
It can be managed via the Cloud Console in your 
cloud environment.For information about using 
your own encryption keys in Google Cloud, see 
Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK).
*   Engage in collaboration and information sharing 
within the industry through various Information 
Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs). Google’s 
participation and membership in a number of ISAC 
allows us to partner and support government and 
industry in continuous education and training, 
and vital engagement with cloud providers. These 
ongoing and continuous engagements, discussions
