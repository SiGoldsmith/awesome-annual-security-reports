that comes with planning and taking action before an attack has been launched. 

However, determining the most effective strategies while navigating the static 

of emerging threats, new security measures, and countless techniques can be a 

daunting task. 

By learning how other organizations are utilizing penetration testing, we gain 

valuable perspectives on the efficacy of different approaches, challenges 

encountered, and lessons learned. Sharing knowledge empowers cybersecurity 

professionals to make informed decisions that align with their organization’s 

unique needs.

With this in mind, Fortra’s Core Security developed a penetration testing survey to 

collect, analyze, and distribute information about how cybersecurity professionals 

are using penetration testing and other proactive solutions. 

Now in its fifth year, this survey continues to track year\-over\-year changes, trends, 

challenges, and areas of development. The information collected is a valuable 

resource for cybersecurity professionals who are committed to growing and 

maintaining a proactive, resilient security posture. This report aims to add insights 

into the current state of pen testing practices, providing ongoing, useful data on 

the following key issues related to pen testing:

• Effectiveness of pen testing in breach prevention

• Top security concerns like phishing, ransomware, and lack of patching

• Challenges with pen testing like personnel shortages and lack of 

remediation resources

• Relevant regulations and compliance concerns

• Usage of in\-house pen testing teams

• Selecting third\-party teams

• Evaluating pen testing toolsets

2024 Penetration Testing ReportValue of Pen Testing 

The results of this year’s survey show the continued value that organizations find 

in penetration testing. With every category experiencing a sizeable boost from last 

year, organizations may also be discovering an increasing number of use cases for 

pen testing. 

Assessing risk and prioritizing vulnerabilities for remediation is the primary 

objective of pen testing and a foundational offensive security practice. So, it is 

unsurprising that it has continued to be the most common response (82%) (Figure 

1\). The 12% increase from last year may be tied to the similarly sized increases 

reflected in those who use pen testing for external compliance (72%) and internal 

mandates (54%). Organizations that began using pen testing as a way to maintain 

and prove adherence may have quickly realized that penetration testing is much 

more than just a box to be ticked. Pen testing provides uniquely in\-depth analysis 

on the potential impact of vulnerabilities being exploited. This gives insights into 

which weaknesses are causing the most risk, providing the most strategic path 

forward in closing security gaps.

Perhaps the greatest proof of the value of penetration testing is that 72% of 

respondents felt that pen testing has prevented a breach at their organization 

(Figure 2\). This underscores the importance of proactive efforts that identify and 

address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. 

It is worth noting that the second most common value that respondents found 

in pen testing was its role in supporting existing vulnerability management 

programs (74%) (Figure 1\). While some organizations may rely solely on one 

proactive solution, like pen testing, it is vital to recognize the value of layering 

offensive security. Incorporating pen testing into a unified, tactical program with 

complementary solutions like vulnerability scanning and red teaming enables 

organizations to enhance coverage and efficacy.

Phishing (80%) and ransomware (72%) were once again the top security concerns

and exploit emerging vulnerabilities, the concern over phishing, ransomware, lack

dominate the concerns of security professionals.

security experts are not being idle— they are also refining their strategies, regularly 

engaging in collaborative efforts, and leveraging new research. And by having 

offensive and defensive tools, engaging in regular blue team training, and fostering 

a culture of vigilance, organizations can do their part to stay ahead of attackers.

What makes phishing and ransomware such pervasive threats? A few reasons:

\- Kits and services offered on the dark webhave a low barrier to entry that even 

allows attackers with limited skills to use them. 

\- Decentralized operations and the complexity of prosecuting international crime 

make ransomware and phishing fairly low risk, and potentially very high reward. 

\- Phishing and ransomware capitalize on human error, which is challenging to 

prevent and makes them universal methods that can target every industry.

As these threats continue to pay off year after year, it’s unlikely that attackers will 

drop these techniques anytime soon. Consequently, organizations need to be 

equally committed to proactive security practices like pen testing to reduce risk as 

much as possible.

And speaking of the need for proactive security, lack of patching (66%) is the third 

most common concern—up 17% from last year (Figure 3\). When vulnerabilities are 

discovered, the only way to ensure an attacker can’t exploit it is to apply a patch as 

soon as it is available. And with over 1000 vulnerabilities in CISA’s Known Exploited 

Vulnerabilities Catalog, the need for applying timely updates is more critical than 

ever. Though it seems a simple enough practice, there are multiple challenges 

that may prevent routine patching at an organization. A lack of personnel can 

cause patching to become deprioritized. Compatibility issues and downtime/

urgency or severity of pen test findings. Particularly when pen tests are being run 

for regulatory adherence, there may be a misperception that meeting compliance 

mandates means the organization is fully secure. If changes are substantial and 

could cause disruption to regular business operations, there may also be hesitancy 

from decision makers to approve changes that need to be made. But the most 

common reason is simply that limited budgets and personnel create competing 

priorities and remediation falls through the cracks. 

In addition to advocating for more support for remediation efforts, security teams 

should make sure that their remediation plans are as clearly outlined as their pen 

testing plans. While good pen test reports include follow\-up recommendations, 

a remediation plan should be fleshed out in more detail. This includes outlining 

the specific steps required to address the highest priority risks, resources needed, 

timelines, and dependencies. 

The inability to hire skilled personnel (34%) and the lack of qualified third parties 

(34%) are both likely continued evidence of the cybersecurity skills gap (Figure 

4\). Penetration testing seems particularly affected by this ongoing shortage. 

According to (ISC)²’s 2023 Cybersecurity Workforce Study, penetration testing was 

the fourth most common skill that SOC teams were missing. The lack of qualified 

third parties certainly indicates that demand outweighs supply.

Even when pen testing services are available, this does not necessary mean they 

are “qualified.” Unfortunately, there are pen testing teams whose services consist 

of little more than a few automated scans. They may use deceptive marketing 

tactics, such as offering unrealistically low prices or fake testimonials. Additionally,

Unsurprisingly, PCI DSS is the most common regulation for which respondents

ongoing influence compliance continues to have on pen testing approaches.

Even when not explicitly required, pen tests are commonly used to fulfill security 

assessment requirements and help verify adherence to other regulations, proving 

to auditors or other authorities that mandated security measures are in place or 

working properly. Up 11% from last year (figure 6\), more organizations are having to 

increase the number of pen tests they are running, likely because of updates and 

additions in cybersecurity law and regulation.

Compliance initiatives have become a global priority, with more changes expected 

in the coming years. The updated Network and Information Security Directive 

(NIS2\) expanded its requirements for risk management and is required to be 

transposed into the national law of all EU member countries by October 2024\. The 

Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) will add risk management requirements 

to financial institutions beginning in 2025\. According to Gartner, 75% of the global 

population will have its personal data under privacy regulations by the end of 2024\. 

Interestingly, there was a 23% increase in respondents that needed to broaden 

the scope of their penetration tests (Figure 6\). There may be a few reasons for 

this. For example, supply chain attacks have led to more scrutiny over third party 

risk management, so organizations may feel more pressure to include third\-party 

systems and networks in engagements. Additionally, if new or updated regulations

2024 Penetration Testing ReportPhishing

With estimates of over three billion phishing emails sent per day, it’s no wonder that 

phishing was the most common security concern of respondents (80%) (Figure 3\). 

Though phishing attacks are nothing new, attackers are always finding ways to 

change up their tactics. For example, generative AI has led to an explosion of 

phishing emails, with a 1,265% increase in malicious emails since 2022\. Business 

Email Compromise (BEC) attacks have also become increasingly common, with 

the FBI receiving 21,489 complaints in 2023 alone. And the top social engineering 

threat last year was hybrid vishing. This multi\-staged attack strategy typically uses

a spoofed email that requests the victim to follow up via phone. This enables the 

attacker to bypass basic security filters, since the payload is only a phone number. 

Annually

As phishing is more widespread than ever, it was disappointing to see a downward 

trend in the frequency of social engineering exercises. Quarterly exercises were 

down 7%, while there was a 6% increase in participants who never run these

exercises (Figure 7\). Though these aren’t huge shifts, given the prevalence of these 

attacks, social engineering exercises should only be on the rise. 

Simulation exercises are one of the only ways to reduce the risk of social 

engineering attacks. There is a common misperception that these exercises 

are limited to raising awareness among employees about the tactics used by 

attackers. However, phishing simulations help validate security practices, providing 

data on how well email filters are detecting phishing emails and measuring the 

efficacy of training programs. They can also help improve incident response, 

ensuring that security teams can respond effectively to real phishing attacks.

never pen test (17%) (Figure 8\).

There is no magic number when it comes to pen testing frequency. Instead, 

it depends on the size of the organization, the complexity of its technical 

infrastructure, the type of data it handles, and applicable compliance regulations. 

Most organizations should be running at least once a year, but additional 

tests should be run if substantial changes are made to the IT environment, if 

vulnerabilities are discovered, or if a security incident has occurred. 

Another reason to consider more than one test a year is to get assurance that 

the vulnerabilities identified during the initial penetration test have been properly 

addressed and remediated. This includes confirming the proper implementation 

of patches and the effectiveness of new security controls like firewalls, intrusion 

detection/prevention systems, and access controls.

Retesting in a timely manner ensures that fixes don’t become new flaws. However, 

Monthly

it is still difficult to get them approved, as evidenced by respondents encountering 

challenges with the lack of follow up after pen testing (62%) (Figure 4\). Retesting 

can often be viewed as less urgent, with many stakeholders seeing initial efforts as 

sufficient or having reluctance about needing to make additional changes. 

Ultimately, though both testing and retesting should be run more often, best 

practices often collide with the real\-world practicalities of resources and budgets. 

In such cases, taking a layered approach to proactive security can be an effective 

approach, as vulnerability management solutions can help fill in gaps between 

pen tests. These solutions are typically highly automated and can easily be 

scheduled to run on a daily or weekly basis. This ensures that the organization can 

stay up to date with some form of assessment.

2024 Penetration Testing ReportIn\-House Pen Testing Efforts

Organizations may decide to add in\-house pen testing capabilities for several 

reasons. An in\-house pen testing team has more familiarity with the business 

operations and IT infrastructure, making it easier to tailor testing methodologies 

and approaches to suit the organization’s specific security needs. They can also 

run tests more frequently, allowing them to bring attention to emerging threats 

in a timely manner, potentially take part in the remediation process, and retest to 

ensure any fixes were appropriately implemented. 

This year shows a 15% decrease in the number of respondents who have in\-

house pen testing teams (Figure 9\). However, the percentage of participants who 

no longer have teams stayed flat at 14%, so it does not appear to indicate that 

organizations are finding in\-house pen testing less helpful. Instead, this decrease 

may be explained by the 16% increase in respondents that leverage third parties 

exclusively (Figure 10\). 

The most common reason organizations don’t have in\-house pen testing is a lack 

of need for a full\-time pen tester/team (55%) (Figure 10\). Smaller organizations 

may have relatively simple IT environments or a small attack surface, making the 

need for frequent or extensive penetration testing less apparent. They also might 

not have the foundational security controls, security awareness, or resources to 

be at the security maturity level that is required to begin pen testing. Alternatively, 

organizations may find their needs sufficiently met by having pen testing be one 

aspect of a broader cybersecurity role. 

Having more general cybersecurity roles has been a common way for 

organizations to cope with the cybersecurity skills gap. The skills gap is also the 

second most common reason for not having an in\-house pen testing team (39%) 

(Figure 10\). According to (ISC)²’s 2023 Cybersecurity Workforce Study, the skills gap 

continues to widen, growing 12\.6% from last year with a record high shortage of 

nearly four million.

using third\-party services for their different skillsets (33%). Perhaps participants 

assumed that this option was only relevant to organizations with in\-house testers, 

since “different” may be interpreted as “different from the skillsets of the in\-house 

pen testing team. If this is the case, the reduction in in\-house team use would 

explain this drop.

There was an 11% increase in the use of third\-party services for compliance 

(56%) (Figure 13\). This aligns with the increase in the number of pen tests run 

for compliance (Figure 6\). Compliance is also frequently cited as the reason 

organizations rotate vendors. However, it is unclear just how often organizations 

should be changing vendors. This may explain why there is so much variation, 

with 24% never switching, 38% switching every 2\-3 years, 18% switching every year, 

and 20% switching after every test (Figure 12\). The truth is, no regulation explicitly 

requires organizations to switch out vendors, it’s just a generally recommended 

practice. 

That said, with the challenges to find qualified third\-party teams (Figure 4\) 

and the desire to consolidate vendors (Figure 22\), organizations may find it 

beneficial to find vendors with large teams. Organizations can leverage internal 

rotation to ensure that different team members are assigned to conduct

2024 Penetration Testing ReportPen Testing Tools

Penetration testing tools are a wide\-ranging category and can include specialized 

tools like port scanners, password crackers, or SQL injection tools, as well as more 

comprehensive tools that offer multiple features to centralize the testing process. 

Pen testing tools are often divided into two categories: open\-source and enterprise. 

Open\-source tools are typically developed and maintained by the cybersecurity 

community. Enterprise tools are commercial solutions offered by cybersecurity 

vendors. While open\-source tools are free to use, they often lack advanced 

features and can’t offer extensive support. Enterprise tools do come with a price 

tag, but they tend to offer features designed to meet compliance regulations and 

keep up with the needs of complex IT environments.

This year 28% of respondents do not use pen testing tools at all—a noteworthy 

27% increase (Figure 14\). This is at least partially due the decrease in respondents 

with in\-house pen testing teams (Figure 9\). However, this increase, in addition to 

the rise in the use of only open\-source tools (33%) (Figure 14\) and the increased 

percentage of respondents that see cost as a top criteria (75%) (Figure 16\), is 

also likely reflective of inflation and global economic volatility. With cybersecurity 

budget growth falling by 65% last year, many organizations may be relying more 

on open\-source when possible. 

However, there is still strong interest in commercial pen testing tools, particularly 

in the features/functionality they can offer (73%) (Figure 16\). Reporting (65%),

(65%) are the top three sought after capabilities in paid penetration testing tools 

(Figure 15\). Reporting is essential to both verify and prove compliance to security 

regulations. Automation capabilities not only fully automate basic tests, but they 

can also enable a hybrid pen testing model. Automation takes care of routine 

tasks, allowing a tester to focus on more complex issues. This speeds up the testing 

process without increasing headcount or sacrificing accuracy. Lastly, an extensive 

threat library provides access to expertly written exploits that are regularly kept up 

to date, making the pen testing process more efficient and safer.

2024 Penetration Testing ReportOther Security Assessment Solutions

Penetration testing is just one part of offensive security and should be part of a

are automated, vulnerability scanners typically provide the most up\-to\-date 

picture of an organization’s security posture. Adding penetration testing is a 

logical next phase, since the data vulnerability scans provide can be used to 

inform penetration tests, providing insights into which weaknesses should be 

explored further. 77% of survey participants that have used pen testing also have 

vulnerability scanners (Figure 18\). Interestingly, 85% of respondents that do not 

use pen testing do have vulnerability scanners (Figure 17\). Their interest in taking a 

survey on pen testing indicates that they are beginning to consider expanding their 

offensive security portfolio. 

Security awareness training (66%) is another foundational offensive security tool. 

These training sessions are typically required for all personnel at an organization, 

so they help promote a culture of security and ensure that everyone is familiar with 

security best practices. Since training is one of the only ways to reduce the risk of 

social engineering attacks, research is regularly being done on how to best convey 

these critical lessons in an efficient, memorable manner. Gamification, responsive 

design, and varied media formats are just a few of the ways that training continues 

to evolve. 

SAST (32%) and DAST (27%), both used for testing applications, demonstrate 

how proactive security can be integrated into the development process. Post\-

exploitation (20%), red teaming (27%) and adversary simulation (23%) are typically 

only used by more mature programs, so participants may not yet be at this stage 

in their security journey. Even those that have reached advanced maturity levels 

may exclusively use red teaming services.

75% of respondents had cost as a top criterion when considering proactive 

solutions (Figure 19\). While cost is always a primary concern, 2023 was especially

2024 Penetration Testing ReportVendor Consolidation

Vendor consolidation continues to be of interest to respondents, with 84% 

saying it is at least somewhat important to their organization (Figure 22\). Vendor 

consolidation offers several advantages. As IT infrastructures become more 

complex, organizations have found increasing amounts of time dedicated to the 

unanticipated task of managing numerous vendors. Dealing with fewer vendors 

simplifies management and reduces time spent on related administrative 

tasks. Developing relationships with a select number of vendors can also lead to 

smoother communication and easier contract negotiations.

Having multiple vendors may also unintentionally add more risk, especially with 

the dramatic increase in supply chain attacks last year. In fact, according to 

Gartner, 60% of supply chain organizations will use cybersecurity risk as a factor 

in determining which third\-parties they work with. With an increased need for due 

diligence and risk assessment before entering into a contract, having a smaller set 

of trusted vendors can significantly increase efficiency.

Vendor consolidation can also incentivize organizations to mature their security 

strategies. 85% of participants that don’t currently use pen testing said that 

they would consider adding proactive solutions if a current vendor offered them 

(Figure 23\). Solutions offered by an existing vendor are especially advantageous 

when they offer interoperability and integration between products, which can 

simplify initial deployment, streamline operations, and reduce complexity. When 

organizations begin looking for vendors that offer the solution they are currently 

looking for, it may be prudent to find those that also provide additional options for 

future investments.

2024 Penetration Testing ReportPen Testing in Different Environments

With its ubiquity across various organizational assets, including workstations, 

servers, and other endpoints, Windows (82%) once again stands out as the 

predominant operating system of concern (Figure 24\). Windows Active Directory 

is a high\-value target for attackers, as it serves as the centralized repository for 

authentication, authorization, and configuration information. If Active Directory is 

compromised, threat actors can have full control of the entire network, so securing 

Windows environments and safeguarding Active Directory against exploitation is 

crucial for minimizing cybersecurity risks and protecting organizational assets.

Web applications remain common environments for pen testing, but the 15% 

increase from last year is worth noting (Figure 24\). It may reflect the increase in 

participants from the finance industry, whose web applications became an even 

more popular target last year (Figure 29\). In fact, web application attacks were 

responsible for 77% of all breaches in the finance and insurance sector, according 

to the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR). Additionally, the DBIR found 

that 95% of attacks were financially motivated, making financial applications 

particularly tempting, as they can store bank account numbers, credit card details, 

Social Security numbers, and transaction history. 

The 20% increase in pen testing for cloud infrastructures (Figure 25\) was a 

promising change, especially as cloud environments become increasingly 

relied upon. For example, cloud native computing grew 175% from 2022 to 2023\. 

Unfortunately, an upward trend in use typically means an upward trend in attacks. 

Sure enough, over 80% of data breaches last year involved data storage in the 

cloud. Organizations would be wise to continue including cloud environments in 

their pen testing strategies.

2024 Penetration Testing ReportConclusion

The results of this survey highlight the importance of pen testing as a strategic 

component of an organization’s proactive cybersecurity portfolio. Just as pen test 

assess infrastructure security, organizations must also regularly evaluate their pen 

testing approach, carefully considering the available tools and methodologies 

to ensure they are effectively addressing their unique security needs and 

requirements.

Pen testing programs are not without their obstacles. The pervasiveness of limited 

resources was evident throughout the survey analysis, with fewer in\-house pen 

testing teams, more organizations going without any commercial pen testing 

tools, and cost becoming the top criterion for both pen testing solutions and 

other proactive security tools. Though organizations may be able to reduce costs 

through vendor consolidation, continuing financial challenges may require difficult 

decisions about how many tests to run, how extensive they should be, and who 

should be running them. 

But the importance of penetration testing extends beyond the immediate scope 

of the tests themselves. Incorporating pen testing in any form opens the door to 

adopting a proactive security mindset.
