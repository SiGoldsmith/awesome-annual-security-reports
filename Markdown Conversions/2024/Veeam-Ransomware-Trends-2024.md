Ransomware Trends

According to the 2024 Data Protection Trends Report that surveyed IT leaders and 
implementers across 10 countries around the world:

• Only 25% of organizations believe they were not hit by ransomware in 2023 
• 49% attest they were hit between one and three times that year 
• 26% of organizations stated they were hit four or more times 

Due to the high attack rates shown in this unbiased report each year, the Ransomware 
Trends Report was commissioned to better understand the attacks, the recoveries, and 
the lessons learned by using a double\-blind anonymous survey of vetted IT leaders with 
firsthand experience with those cyberattacks to dig deeper through additional research: 
The 2024 Ransomware Trends Report.

Inside 2024 Ransomware Trends

The 2024 Ransomware Trends Report is the third annual publication of unbiased 
research conducted by a team of independent analysts surveying anonymous but vetted 
organizations who suffered at least one successful cyberattack in the preceding 12 months. 
Each year, this report curates 1,200 responses with an intentional breakdown of roughly 
400 individuals in three key roles that are responsible for part of an organization's cyber 
resiliency strategy: 

• CISO or senior executive: Responsible for an organization’s cyber resiliency strategy 
•
• Backup administrator: Responsible for ongoing protection and recovery of IT data 

Information security professional: Responsible for the prevention and detection of cyber events 

Ransomware continues to be a growing concern for everyone in the IT industry. Gartner 
is globally forecasting a 3\.5% planned increase in overall IT budgets for 2024\. Respondents 
in this survey are expecting budget increases of: 

6\.5%

6\.1%

increase in budget for cyber 
prevention and detection 
technologies

increase in budget for recovery technologies 
such as backup and business 
continuity/disaster recovery (BCDR)

Overall IT spending is up, increasing cyber resiliency budgets to nearly double the overall 
increase in IT spending. Thus, backup and cyber investments are taking “more than their 
share” of the increased IT investments while other areas are being deprioritized to address 
cyberthreats. Clean backup copies, which one might presume includes data that is 
‘survivable’ against attacks and does not include malicious code.

63% of Organizations Are Not Aligned

For the third year in a row, more than half of organizations — 63% — believe that there is 
either a “significant improvement” or “complete overhaul” needed for organizations to be 
aligned between their backup and cyber teams. 

Globally, of the three roles surveyed, backup administrators were the least satisfied with 
the alignment of their teams.

It’ll Take a Village to Recover

According to survey respondents, the two teams most often notified to kick off remediation 
efforts are the executives responsible for prevention and remediation and the IT backup team. 
This is quickly followed by cybersecurity experts and the organization’s overall risk 
management team. 

94% of the organizations surveyed stated they also utilized third parties during their recovery 
process, with these four types of experts being the most commonly engaged: 

• Security software vendors 
• Backup software vendors 
• Security specialists for forensics 
• Resellers, partners, or service providers

Ransomware Trends

Expect to Lose 18% of Your Data 
from a Cyberattack

Two of the most impactful statistics from the 1,200 global lessons we learned in 2023 are: 

41%

57%

of production data was 
successfully encrypted by bad 
actors in last year's attacks

of the affected data was 
recoverable after being encrypted 
in a ransomware attack

Unfortunately, if only 57% of your data was recoverable, then 43% was not; therefore, 18% of 
your production data was irrecoverable. Organizations of all sizes participated in this survey 
and surprisingly revealed that neither the size of their organization, nor their locale had a 
significant effect on their attack or recoverability rates. All organizations got hit roughly the 
same amount the world over and faced a similar amount of damage. 

Organizations may also be surprised to find that there was not a significant variation 
between data center effects found in remote offices vs. branch offices, or even on data 
hosted in a public cloud vs. a private one. 

Did You Pay? Did It Work?

Two key questions asked each year in this survey are:

• Did you pay the ransom? 
• Were you able to recover?

Ransomware Trends

In 2023:

54%

27%

11%

Paid and were able to 
recover their data from 
the attack

Paid but could not 
recover data lost in 
the attack

Recovered without 
paying the ransom that 
was demanded

With the remaining 4%, no ransom was asked for. These stats are notable namely because it 
shows that roughly one in four organizations that paid the ransom still could not recover 
even after paying. 

There’s More to an Attack than the Ransom

83% of organizations believe they have insurance, though 24% of those insurance policies 
specifically exclude ransomware. However, the costs of prevention, detection, recovery 
services, and the ransom itself are far from the only financial factors that can impact your 
organization in the event of a ransomware attack. In fact, out of all the responses to this 
year’s survey, only 1 in 9 organizations (11%) stated that ransom payment made the significant 
majority of the overall financial impact to their organization. For the rest of the cyber victims, 
the overall financial impact was substantially more than “just” the ransom itself. 

65% of Organizations Paid Their Ransom 
with Insurance 

Regarding companies' internal policies in 2023, only a few organizations (17%) did not have a 
policy for whether to pay or not. While the majority of organizations did have a policy, there 
were nearly equal sentiments towards paying (47%) versus not paying (36%).

Ransomware Trends

Regardless of whether they had a policy or not, it should not surprise anyone that while only 
a minority of organizations had a policy to pay, 81% ended up paying. That said, 65% paid 
with insurance and another 21% had insurance but chose to pay without making a claim. 
This means that in 2023, 86% of organizations had insurance that they could have used for 
a cyber event. 

These options will diminish as cyber insurance continues to change in response to ever 
increasing claims. At last renewal: 

73%

44%

14%

of organizations 
experienced a premium in 
response to the changing 
IT landscape 

had their deductible 
increased due to ransomware 
and cyberattacks becoming 
more common

saw their coverage benefits 
reduced as insurance companies 
tried to protect themselves from 
the growing threat of 
ransomware 

Cyber Villains Want Your Backups

In much the same way that your prevention team’s playbook expects a clean and recoverable 
backup, the cyber villain’s playbook intends to disable your ability to recover your own data. 
Unfortunately, in far too many attacks, the attackers are successful in removing your ability 
to save yourself. Thus, the data shows that only 15% of organizations recovered without paying. 
On average, 37% of backup repositories were affected by a successful attack. 

67% Do Not Have a Recovery Plan

In 95% of organizations — who had a team with a plan — the two most common aspects of 
their incident response playbook was the assurance of clean and recoverable data. 
This explains why 33% of organizations have an alternate infrastructure in their plan, which 
unfortunately means that the other 67% do not have a plan for where they will recover after
a site\-level crisis.

Ransomware Trends

However, cyberattacks affect not only the organization and its teams, but the individuals 
caught most in the fray as well. Of those surveyed this year, the key personal effects included 
increased workload, stress, and other human factors which most organizations already 
struggle to balance or mitigate even on “normal” days. 

The Attack Will Be Worse than You Imagined 
and Cost More than You're Expecting

With 41% of data affected by a cyberattack and only 57% of that affected data being 
recoverable, organizations can reasonably expect to lose 18% of data per cyberattack. 
Moreover, the ransom averages to make up only 32% of the overall financial impact while
only 62% of the overall impact is in some way reclaimable through insurance or other means. 
This comes along with everything else going against the organization's bottom dollar budget. 

2024 Is Not Immutable Enough

In 2024, it is not unreasonable that organizations would embrace immutable storage within 
their on\-premises disk, complemented by immutable cloud repositories and air\-gapped tapes. 
Unfortunately, even of those who have suffered at least one cyberattack in the past, only 75% 
use hardened disks on\-premises, and only 85% use immutable clouds. 

Only 50% of organization’s overall backup storage is immutable.

That said, it is encouraging that organizations are embracing the industry standard 3\-2\-1 Rule 
of having multiple media types, regardless of whether those media types may be immutable or 
not. In 2024, in addition to whatever disk repositories are on\-premises, 47% of production data 
is still retained on at least one tape while 54% is also replicated to a cloud.
