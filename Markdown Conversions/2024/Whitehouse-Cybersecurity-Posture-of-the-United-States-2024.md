## Letter from the National Cyber Director
I am pleased to present the 2024 Report on the Cybersecurity Posture of the United States. This first-ever report provides important updates on how the Nation is addressing the challenges and opportunities we face in cyberspace. We have made progress in realizing an affirmative vision for a safe, prosperous, and equitable digital future, but the threats we face remain daunting, our defenses are not impregnable, and our work continues to evolve to meet the changing landscape.

Simply put, we are in the midst of a fundamental transformation in our Nation’s cybersecurity. It is now clear that a reactive posture cannot keep pace with fast-evolving cyber threats and a dynamic technology landscape, and that aspiring just to manage the worst effects of cyber incidents is no longer sufficient to ensure our national security, economic prosperity, and democratic values. Beginning with Executive Order 14028 on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, the Biden-Harris Administration has advanced an affirmative vision centered on proactively and strategically shaping the digital world around us, positioning it to enable every aspect of our economy and society.

The President’s National Cybersecurity Strategy asserts that it is necessary to fundamentally shift the underlying dynamics of the digital world to make it defensible, resilient, and aligned with our values. If we succeed, the digital ecosystem can be a strong foundation for a prosperous, connected future that benefits every American. While we remain postured to forcefully respond to malicious cyber threats, we will not let our adversaries dictate our path forward.

Implementing this new vision requires a collaborative, whole-of-nation effort. The most capable and best-positioned actors in cyberspace, in both public and private sectors, need to do more to reshape the digital ecosystem and protect the vulnerable. We are committed to working closely with our partners in the private sector, with State, local, Tribal, and territorial entities, and with like-minded nations around the world to enhance our collective resilience to cyber threats.

Congress has also been a vital partner in this implementation process, and we will continue to engage with Congress to ensure that departments and agencies have the resources and authorities they need. With no shortage of challenges on the horizon, the Administration and Congress must continue to work together in a nonpartisan manner to advance U.S. cybersecurity and resilience.

As the President stated at the Strategy’s launch, “The steps we take and choices we make today will determine the direction of our world for decades to come.” We need to build on the successes of the past year, learn lessons from where we fell short, and take on hard challenges such as harmonizing cybersecurity regulations, empowering Sector Risk Management Agencies, and supporting smaller organizations facing down capable adversaries. Together, we will build a digital world that keeps Americans safe from cyber threats and enables our grandest ambitions.

## Executive Summary
The 2024 Report on the Cybersecurity Posture of the United States assesses the cybersecurity posture of the United States, the effectiveness of national cyber policy and strategy, and the status of the implementation of national cyber policy and strategy by Federal departments and agencies. Additionally, this report highlights cybersecurity threats and issues facing the United States, including new or emerging technologies that may affect national security, economic prosperity, and the rule of law. This is the first edition of the report and covers calendar year 2023, with additional consideration of developments in 2024 preceding the publication of this report.

Over the past year, U.S. national cybersecurity posture improved, driven by steady progress towards the 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy’s (NCS) vision of a defensible, resilient, and values-aligned digital ecosystem achieved through fundamental shifts in the underlying dynamics that shape cyberspace. The Administration has successfully begun implementation of the NCS Implementation Plan, which coordinates actions by departments and agencies across the Federal Government to make the President’s affirmative vision a reality. These initial implementation actions set the foundation for further investment and sustained commitment by stakeholders across the digital ecosystem.

### The Strategic Environment
This report begins with an assessment of the strategic environment, the landscape of emerging technologies and cyber risks that present both challenges and opportunities for U.S. cybersecurity policy and strategy. The analysis of emerging technologies considers not just their internal technical characteristics, but also their integration into complex systems and processes, their connection to people and workers, and their relationship to institutions and governance structures. This report also examines the cyber risk landscape, considering both trends in threat actor capability and intent, as well as the evolving vulnerabilities in our own defenses that create pathways for these adversaries to exploit.

In 2023, the strategic environment was characterized by complexity, interconnectivity, and competition. Continued progress in digital communications, advanced computing, quantum information science, data storage and processing, and other critical and emerging technologies are rapidly increasing the complexity of our economy and society. These technologies also connect people around the world, enable the proliferation of cyber-physical systems, and create new dependencies between critical infrastructure and essential services across every sector. As this landscape evolves, malicious state and non-state actors are exploiting its seams with growing capability and strategic purpose, making clear that cyberspace is closely aligned with other domains of international conflict and competition.

Five trends, in addition to enduring cybersecurity challenges, drove change in the strategic environment in 2023.

1.  **Evolving Risks to Critical Infrastructure**: Nation-state adversaries demonstrated a growing willingness to use cyber capabilities to compromise and hold at risk critical infrastructure systems and assets with no inherent espionage value, in order to further their broader strategic objectives.

2.  **Ransomware**: Ransomware remained a persistent threat to national security, public safety, and economic prosperity, and ransomware groups continued to develop sophisticated strategies to evade or circumvent defensive and disruptive measures designed to frustrate their activities.

3.  **Supply Chain Exploitation**: Complex and interconnected supply chains for software and other information technology and services enabled malicious actors to compromise victims at scale.

4.  **Commercial Spyware**: There was a growing market for sophisticated and invasive cyber-surveillance tools sold to nation-state actors by private vendors to access electronic devices remotely, monitor and extract their content, and manipulate their components without the knowledge or consent of the devices’ users.

5.  **Artificial Intelligence**: Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most powerful, publicly accessible technologies of our time, and its continued evolution in 2023 presented opportunities and challenges for cyber risk management at scale.

### Current Efforts
Addressing the challenges and seizing the opportunities presented by the strategic environment requires a coherent program of action led by the Federal Government and aligned with private sector efforts. The Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) coordinates the implementation of national cyber policy and strategy, including the NCS, by driving new actions and uplifting and connecting work underway. This report reflects important contributions to national cybersecurity made by departments and agencies across the Federal Government.

The National Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation Plan (NCSIP), released in July 2023, guides Federal efforts to realize the vision of the NCS and is updated on an annual basis. In NCSIP Version 1, the Federal Government was responsible for completing 36 initiatives by the second quarter of 2024. As detailed in this report, 33 of these 36 (92%) initiatives were completed on time and three remain underway. An additional 33 NCSIP Version 1 initiatives have completion dates over the next two years and are on track.

12. **Advancing a Rights-Respecting Digital Ecosystem** by advancing an affirmative vision of an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, accessible, and secure Internet; combatting the proliferation and misuse of digital technologies like commercial spyware; and shaping emerging technologies to align with democratic values and human rights.

### Future Outlook
In 2024 and beyond, the Federal Government will build on accomplishments of the past year, continue to implement the NCS and NCWES, and adapt its approach to address emergent challenges and opportunities presented by an evolving strategic landscape. It will be necessary to sustain efforts to enhance the capabilities of Sector Risk Management Agencies, strengthen the national cyber workforce, implement incident reporting requirements directed by the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA), enhance the speed and scale of adversary disruption campaigns, improve analytics and information sharing mechanisms, continue to invest in quantum information science, and prioritize cybersecurity in foreign assistance mechanisms.

The next iteration of the NCS implementation plan, NCSIP Version 2, outlines 31 new initiatives that build on shared accomplishments of the past year and establish new lines of effort to continue to implement the NCS. NCSIP Version 2 has been published alongside this report and is available online at www.whitehouse.gov/oncd.

## Introduction
A fundamental transformation is underway. At the core of this transformation are new technologies which we have made foundational to our national security, our economy, our democracy, and our modern way of life. Innovations in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), quantum information science (QIS), and microelectronics are revolutionizing the advanced computing landscape. Our digital and physical worlds are increasingly connected, in both industrial applications and consumer-facing products. Growing access to high-speed Internet and the proliferation of next-generation telecommunications networks are connecting people and systems around the world.

As this digital ecosystem evolves, our adversaries have repeatedly demonstrated their capability and intent to exploit its vulnerabilities. Both state and non-state actors continue to aggressively conduct malicious cyber activity that threatens U.S. national security, public safety, and economic prosperity. Critical infrastructure across the United States has been held at risk by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and other adversaries who threaten our essential services and public safety in service of their geopolitical ambitions. Ransomware groups have built a business model around targeting schools, hospitals, small businesses, and many others ill-equipped to defend themselves.

In this decisive moment, the Biden-Harris Administration put forth a new approach centered on proactively shaping our shared, digitally-enabled future. Released in March 2023, the President’s National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) articulates a new, affirmative vision of a digital ecosystem that is defensible, resilient, and aligned with our values. The NCS moves away from previous approaches that were predicated on managing threat actors in a digital ecosystem that advantaged their malicious activity. Instead, the NCS calls for two fundamental shifts in how we allocate roles, responsibilities, and resources in cyberspace by (1) rebalancing the responsibility to defend cyberspace away from end users and to the most capable and best-positioned actors in the public and private sectors, and (2) realigning incentives to favor long-term investments in future resilience.

The NCS recognizes the need for modern and nimble regulatory frameworks for critical infrastructure cybersecurity. The NCS targets market interventions, such as device labeling programs and a software liability regime, to address economic dynamics that contribute to poor cybersecurity outcomes. Where technical vulnerabilities create pervasive challenges for cyber defenders, the NCS calls for coordinated investment in standards and research and development to eliminate them. And, as the NCS makes clear, investing in talent is a key part of investing in our digital future. The 2023 National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy (NCWES) outlines a comprehensive approach aimed at addressing both immediate and long-term cyber workforce needs while empowering every American to participate in our digital ecosystem.

With this new strategic course set, the Administration has turned to the vital work of implementation. Successful implementation is at its core a collaborative endeavor, requiring contributions from across the Federal Government, industry, academia, civil society, and other partners around the world. Congress has provided essential support to the implementation process by empowering departments and agencies with necessary authorities and resources.

Version 1 of the NCS Implementation Plan (NCSIP) lays out a roadmap of 69 initiatives for the Federal Government to carry out to achieve the NCS’s objectives. To date, the cybersecurity community has completed 33 items in the first year of the NCSIP, and undertaken countless other efforts to make cyberspace safer and more secure. The next iteration of the NCSIP, Version 2, builds on successes achieved in the first year of implementation, responds to emerging and unexpected challenges, and outlines 31 new initiatives to implement the 2023 NCS. This report highlights key implementation efforts, accomplishments, and trends from the past year to demonstrate how the United States is proactively and strategically shaping the digital ecosystem to make it more defensible, resilient, and aligned with our values.

## The Strategic Environment
The strategic environment consists of an evolving ecosystem of people, technologies, and institutions, as well as the malicious actors who exploit vulnerabilities in this ecosystem to cause harm. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s 2024 Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community makes clear that both state and non-state actors continue to pursue cyber capabilities that threaten U.S. national interests in cyberspace and beyond. The PRC, in particular, remains the most active and persistent cyber threat to U.S. Government, private sector, and critical infrastructure networks. Nation-state actors from Russia, Iran, and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), as well as transnational criminal organizations and other non-state actors, are responsible for a wide range of malicious activity that impacts the United States and our allies and partners.

However, the cyber risk landscape is defined by more than these actors and their malicious activities. Threat is only one component of risk, and remedying vulnerabilities in cyberspace, enhancing our resilience, or otherwise mitigating the consequences of successful cyber incidents are more directly within our control. In analyzing the strategic environment, this report considers the combination of adversary capability and intent, the distribution and severity of vulnerabilities in our digital ecosystem, and the processes and policies we deploy to address these challenges. Below, we highlight both enduring cybersecurity challenges and the emergent trends that drove change in the strategic environment this year.

Our strategic environment is characterized by growing complexity, interconnectivity, and competition, as critical and emerging technologies further accelerate the pace of change and require us to rapidly reimagine risks and opportunities in a digitally-enabled world. Advanced computing technologies, the convergence of digital and physical systems, and the presence of new actors across our critical infrastructure landscape make for a complex world where risks can be difficult to identify. Sprawling supply chains, widening access to communications networks, and interdependent global infrastructures have led to an increasingly interconnected world. Simultaneously, the strategic environment has become increasingly competitive, as both state and non-state actors pursue their interests using sophisticated cyber capabilities. Geopolitical conflict is increasingly playing out in cyberspace, amplifying risks to U.S. and allied critical infrastructure.

### Enduring Cybersecurity Challenges
Cyber defenders face more adversaries than ever, as a growing number of state-affiliated, criminal, and ideologically-motivated actors launch cyber operations against the United States. These adversaries benefit from longstanding structural asymmetries, including the fact that attackers can begin exploiting vulnerabilities before defenders can develop and deploy patches, and network interdependencies that allow exploitation of victims at scale. Enduring use of insecure practices by the software development community, such as programming in memory unsafe languages, further advantages attackers. Additionally, challenges in attribution enable malicious actors to obfuscate their behavior to avoid consequences.

Legacy protocols and technical architectures with poor security attributes are deeply embedded across the digital ecosystem, from legacy mobile networks to how we route data across the Internet. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which directs Internet traffic, is susceptible to traffic hijacking and route manipulation. Attackers can also leverage weaknesses in outdated encryption protocols to compromise communications.

Emerging digital technologies often present adversaries with new opportunities for malicious exploitation. The development of a viable large-scale quantum computer, for example, promises tremendous economic benefits, potentially creating entirely new industries and revolutionizing our digital ecosystem. However, we have known for decades that quantum computing has the potential to break many widely used cryptographic systems that keep our information safe. In the wrong hands, a sufficiently mature quantum computer would challenge the integrity of the digital ecosystem, threaten sensitive health and personal financial data, and defeat security protocols for most Internet-based ﬁnancial transactions.

Critical infrastructure owners and operators rely on third-party service providers to manage key aspects of their digital operations. The adoption of cloud services, for example, can enable better and more economical cybersecurity outcomes at scale, but cloud migration may also present novel cybersecurity risks. Hybrid deployments, in which organizations use both locally hosted systems and cloud assets, can introduce complex centralized logging and authentication regimes, creating opportunities for malicious actors to evade detection and abuse identity management systems. The 2023 PRC compromise of U.S. government communications demonstrates the necessity of maintaining comprehensive logging. More broadly, as organizations migrate increasing amounts of data and processes to the cloud, this shift introduces new cross-sector dependencies and complicates systemic risk identification and management, particularly where multiple organizations rely on third-party services from the same provider.

Our critical infrastructure landscape is characterized by private ownership and operation, which results in interdependencies between public and private sectors and which requires a national cybersecurity posture rooted in public-private action, collaboration, and partnership. The rapidly expanding space industry illustrates how advances in technology create new challenges and opportunities for collaboration to manage shared cyber risk. A growing number of critical infrastructure assets rely upon space-based systems for communications, sensing, navigation, and timing. In the days leading up to Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, a cyberattack against a U.S. space communications company, ostensibly intended to disrupt Ukrainian telecommunications, also led to outages for computer systems used by thousands of European wind turbines. As the space ecosystem continues to evolve and integrate new commercial participants, the cybersecurity of space systems will be a shared responsibility.

America’s cyber workforce continues to grapple with a persistent need for more trained cybersecurity professionals and a better cyber education ecosystem. Getting more Americans involved in the cyber workforce not only strengthens our national cybersecurity outcomes, it also provides access to good-paying, middle-class jobs. We must develop cyber talent through formal and informal cyber education and training systems as a matter of economic development and national security. While U.S. schools, governments, non-profits, and companies have made

strides in developing American cyber talent, these investments have lacked the scale and coordination necessary to meet increasing demand.

### Top Trends of 2023
#### Evolving Risks to Critical Infrastructure
U.S. critical infrastructure faces evolving and unacceptable cyber risks. Nation-state adversaries are developing cyber capabilities and gaining accesses with the intent of disrupting or destroying U.S. and allied critical infrastructure. Such disruptions could support or enable an adversary’s strategic objectives outside of the cyber domain and pose challenges for risk management within and across critical infrastructure sectors.

While adversaries pre-positioning for cyberattacks is a long-standing threat, the PRC’s pre-positioning activity is a threat unlike any America has previously faced. In 2023, a PRC actor tracked as Volt Typhoon gained access to critical infrastructure in the United States and the Indo-Pacific region. Critically, this campaign targeted U.S. entities that presented little value from an espionage or intelligence perspective, but which could enable disruption of operational technology systems in critical infrastructure and interference with U.S. and allied warfighting capabilities. Also in 2023, PRC actors tracked as BlackTech used sophisticated tools to compromise routers and gain access to a wide variety of U.S. and Japanese critical infrastructure. These intrusions demonstrated the PRC’s intention to hold at risk U.S. and allied critical infrastructure, shape U.S. decision-making in a time of crisis, and use cyber capabilities to augment PRC geopolitical objectives.

#### Ransomware
Ransomware remains a persistent threat to national security, public safety, and economic prosperity. Comprehensive data on the full scope of the ransomware threat is difficult to obtain, particularly with cyber incident reporting requirements still evolving and victims reluctant to share information about attacks. Following a brief decrease in 2022, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) received a 22% increase in reported ransomware incidents from American victims. Reports to the IC3 also reflected a 74% increase in the cost of ransomware incidents in 2023, relative to 2022.

Established ransomware groups are continuing to develop sophisticated strategies to monetize their accesses and evade or circumvent defensive measures designed to frustrate their activities. Attackers have increased the use of “double” and “triple extortion” attacks, not only encrypting victims’ data but also threatening to sell or publicly release that data if a ransom is not paid, and sometimes also threatening to dox victims if they do not pay an additional fee. Victims who make these additional ransomware payments rely on their attackers’ promise to delete exfiltrated data and refrain from doxing attacks, a promise that is not always kept. Ransomware actors form conspiracies with each other, dividing up the work of developing and deploying malware, carrying out attacks on individual targets, and collecting cryptocurrency ransoms. This form of criminal economic specialization has made the ransomware threat especially potent.

O F  T H E  U N I T E D  S T A T E S

#### Supply Chain Exploitation
Complex and interconnected supply chains for software and other information technology and services, combined with growing reliance on common third-party service providers, create opportunities for sophisticated adversaries to access victims at scale and complicate the efforts of defenders to identify and manage cybersecurity risks. Adversaries are increasingly taking advantage of complex and interconnected relationships between organizations and their suppliers, customers, vendors, and service providers, compromising single nodes that grant surreptitious access to victims in the United States and around the world.

In 2023, several high-profile compromises of technology providers impacted thousands of connected victims, including critical infrastructure owners and operators. In December, Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) targeted servers used by computer programmers to compile and test software, presumably intending to maliciously modify developers’ source code. Earlier in the year, a compromise of a widely used identity and access management firm enabled malicious actors to steal credentials and session tokens that could provide surreptitious access to thousands of customers. And, at the beginning of the year, a popular enterprise communications suite was compromised in an entirely separate supply chain attack, demonstrating how a single initial compromise can quickly spread through interlinked technology supply chains and third-party relationships.

#### Commercial Spyware
There is a growing market for sophisticated and invasive end-to-end cyber-surveillance tools sold by private vendors to access electronic devices remotely, monitor and extract their content, and manipulate their components without the knowledge or consent of the devices’ users. Commercial spyware providers now offer world-class capabilities to the highest bidder, who often employ these capabilities in cyber operations that are not subject to oversight or regulatory constraints. While the commercial spyware industry has a long history, the recent proliferation and misuse of these tools allows malicious cyber actors to target journalists, activists, human rights defenders, and government officials with greater frequency.

A growing number of authoritarian regimes and democratic governments have misused commercial spyware to surveil targets; intimidate perceived opponents; suppress dissent; limit freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, or association; and otherwise abuse human rights. Some foreign governments and persons have deployed commercial spyware against U.S. government personnel, information, and computer systems, presenting significant counterintelligence and security risks to the United States. The misuse of these tools also threatens the security and privacy of individuals in the United States and around the world.

#### Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most powerful technologies of our time, and it continues to receive substantial public attention and media coverage. Advances in large-language models (LLMs) and other foundational algorithms, combined with more affordable computing power and access to data, have given rise to a new generation of AI tools. These tools captured

the public’s imagination in 2023, as Americans experienced novel applications such as chatbots and image generators. AI will almost certainly continue to evolve at a rapid pace in the years to come, with public and private entities around the world vying for profit and competitive advantage.

The evolving AI landscape will present cyber defenders with new opportunities to defend critical infrastructure against malicious activity. The cybersecurity community has a long history of harnessing the power of machine learning techniques for basic tasks like data processing, email filtering, and malware identification. New cyber defense tools that integrate AI could eventually enable cyber defenders to more efficiently detect anomalous network traffic and other adversary activity, coordinate the defense of complex systems and networks, and augment a cybersecurity workforce that is already stretched thin.

AI tools may also make our software development ecosystem safer and more secure. While LLMs have shown some fluency in programming languages, they cannot yet generate commercially useful secure code without human intervention. Responsible integration of AI tools into the software development lifecycle may enable developers to identify vulnerabilities in new code and suggest potential fixes. As AI tools mature, they could be able to make widely used software products more secure by rewriting existing code into a memory-safe programming language.

However, realizing the promise of AI also challenges us to manage the risks it poses to cybersecurity. Today, LLMs can quickly and cheaply generate persuasive and micro-targeted text, images, audio, and video in different languages. Cybercriminals, hacktivists, and others with limited resources and technical sophistication may use these capabilities to conduct phishing campaigns, information operations, and other malicious cyber activity. AI-enabled surveillance and censorship technologies enable authoritarian regimes to more effectively and efficiently target journalists, dissidents, and human rights defenders. Without safeguards, AI technologies may also put Americans’ privacy at risk by making it easier to extract, identify, and exploit personal data. As the AI ecosystem continues to evolve, there is an opportunity to ensure that its core elements—data, computing, and algorithms—are developed with safeguards against misuse.

## Current Efforts
The Federal Government is undertaking a bold program of action to implement the NCS and proactively shape the digital ecosystem to align with U.S. national objectives. These efforts build on generational investments in new infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and CHIPS and Science Act; cybersecurity legislation such as CIRCIA; and executive actions including Executive Order (EO) 14028 on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, National Security Memorandum (NSM) 5 on Improving Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Control Systems, and NSM-8 on Improving the Cybersecurity of National Security, Department of Defense, and Intelligence Systems.

NCSIP Version 1, released in July 2023, guides Federal efforts to realize the vision of the NCS through 69 high-impact initiatives, from combatting cybercrime to building a skilled cyber workforce to addressing security challenges present in the technical foundations of the Internet. In NCSIP Version 1, the Federal Government was responsible for completing 36 initiatives by the second quarter of 2024. As detailed in the table below, 33 of these 36 (92%) initiatives were completed on time and three remain underway.
