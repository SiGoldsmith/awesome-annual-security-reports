Welcome to the 9th edition of the Edgescan 
Vulnerability Stats Report 2024. 
This report demonstrates the state of full stack 
security based on thousands of security assessments 
and penetration tests on millions of assets that were 
performed globally from the Edgescan Cybersecurity 
Platform in 2023.  
This is an analysis of vulnerabilities detected in 
the systems of hundreds of organizations across a 
wide range of industries – from the Fortune 500 to 
medium and small businesses. 
The report provides a statistical model of the most 
common weaknesses faced by organizations to 
enable data-driven decisions for managing risks and 
exposures more effectively.  
We hope this report will provide a unique 
by-the-numbers insight into trends, statistics and 
a snapshot of the overall state of cybersecurity for 
the past year, from the perspective of vulnerabilities 
discovered and remediated, as well as penetration 
testing success rates.   
We are proud that this yearly report has become a 
reliable source for approximating the global state of 
vulnerability management. This is exemplified by our 
unique dataset being part of the Verizon Data Breach 
Investigations Report (DBIR), which is the de facto 
standard for insights into the common drivers for 
incidents and breaches today.  
This year we delve into Risk Density to describe 
where critical severity vulnerabilities and exposures 
are clustered in the IT technical stack, quantification 
of attack surface management exposures and 
risks, and Mean Time To Remediate (MTTR) critical 
vulnerabilities. 
## Introduction & Synopsis
We split our statistical models across layers 
of the technology stack (Full Stack) such as 
Web Application, API, and Device/Host layers. 
Additionally, we make a distinction in the data, 
highlighting if discovered CVE’s have associated 
exploit code freely available.
Unfortunately, we still see high rates of known 
(patchable) exploitable vulnerabilities, with working 
exploits in the wild being used by nation states and 
cyber criminal groups against organizations who are 
slow to patch.  
Since Edgescan employs a number of risk 
prioritization scoring mechanisms, we take a 
deeper look at the most common risks faced by 
organizations and also look at correlation of the 
various risk scoring methodologies. 
Some of the results are surprising and we hope 
you will stay to the end to learn more!  
Given Edgescan maps validated vulnerabilities 
automatically to CVSS[^1] (Common Vulnerability 
Scoring System), CISA KEV[^2] (Cyber Security & 
Infrastructure Security Agency Known Exploited 
Vulnerability Catalogue), EPSS[^3] (Exploit Prediction 
Scoring System) and our own EVSS (Edgescan 
Validated Security Score), we have leveraged this 
information to provide a qualitatively better guide 
to what the most common risks are, as faced by 
systems deployed in modern enterprises.

When we examine cyber posture from an attack 
surface standpoint, exposed services are a real risk. 
Statistically some vulnerabilities have a very low 
frequency of occurrence compared to the total 
number of vulnerabilities discovered, but many will 
result in a breach with an outsized impact, which we 
can call an intensive rather than extensive risk.  
Similarly to the 2023 report, patching and 
maintenance is a challenge and we still find that 
it is not trivial to patch production systems. 
The MTTR (Mean Time to Remediation) stats also 
reflect on this issue. Continuous detection and 
assessment needs improvement and as I’ve always 
said, visibility is paramount.   
Internal, non-public cyber security posture is 
significantly lacking in terms of resilience and ease 
of exploit. Combining vulnerabilities across the stack, 
in some cases, results in the potential impact being 
much more severe than the sum of the individual 
discovered vulnerabilities.  
Oddly, CVE’s dating from 2015 are still being 
discovered and are being used by ransomware 
and malware toolkits to exploit systems when 
they can find them.  
## Welcome
Attack Surface Management (Visibility) is a key driver 
to cybersecurity best practices and based on our 
continuous asset profiling, we discuss how common 
sensitive and critical systems are exposed to the 
public Internet far more than they should be. 
The assumption here is that enterprises simply do 
not have systems, people and processes in place, 
to make them aware of exposures in a manner that 
facilitates remediation actions.  
This report provides a global snapshot across 
dozens of industry verticals and how to prioritize 
what is important, as not all vulnerabilities are 
created equal.   
Best regards,
Eoin Keary
Founder,

## 2023 – Year in Review
MOST SIGNIFICANT BREACHES IN 2023
In 2023, several significant cyber breaches occurred, impacting millions of 
individuals and organizations worldwide. Some of the largest breaches include:
DISH Network: Went offline due to a 
ransomware attack by the Black Basta 
ransomware gang, affecting websites, 
mobile apps and internal systems.

GoDaddy: Suffered a multi-year breach 
where attackers stole source code and 
installed malware, affecting 1.2 million 
Managed WordPress customers.
MGM Resorts International: Was hit by a 
massive cyberattack that impacted systems 
across its properties, attributed to the 
BlackCat ransomware operation.
3CX: Experienced a breach by the North Korean 
Lazarus hacking group through a supply chain 
attack, compromising the 3CX Phone System 
used by over 350,000 companies worldwide.
Barracuda: Announced that their Email 
Security Gateway (ESG) appliances were hacked 
using a zero-day vulnerability, leading to a 
recommendation that impacted ESG appliances 
be immediately replaced.
ESXiArgs ransomware attack: Targeted 
VMware ESXi servers globally, encrypting virtual 
machines for thousands of companies.
These breaches highlight the diversity of cyber threats, from database exposures and ransomware attacks to supply 
chain vulnerabilities and DDoS attacks. They underscore the importance of cybersecurity measures, including secure 
configurations, vigilant monitoring and prompt incident response strategies.
ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research): 
This breach involved the personal data of 815 
million Indian residents, apparently exfiltrated 
from the ICMR’s Covid-testing database. The 
data included names, ages, genders, addresses, 
passport numbers, and Aadhaar numbers.
DarkBeam: A digital risk protection firm, 
exposed 3.8 billion records due to a 
misconfigured Elasticsearch and Kibana 
interface. Although most records came from 
previous breaches, the exposed data could 
facilitate phishing campaigns.
SAP SE Bulgaria: Researchers discovered 
Kubernetes Secrets related to hundreds 
of organizations exposed in public GitHub 
repositories, including SAP SE, exposing 
95,592,696 records/artifacts.
TmaxSoft: An IT company in South Korea, 
exposed 2 TB of data, including over 56 million 
sensitive records, via a Kibana dashboard for 
more than two years.
Anonymous Sudan: A hacktivist group 
conducted DDoS attacks against large tech 
firms, including Microsoft’s Outlook, OneDrive, 
and Azure portal. These attacks demonstrated 
the capability to impact major tech 
infrastructure.
PayPal: Experienced a credential stuffing attack 
that compromised 34,942 accounts, exposing 
personal information such as names, addresses, 
and social security numbers (14†source).

## Vulnerability Severity 
EPSS, CISA KEV & EVSS 
What is EPSS? 
The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) is an open, data-driven effort for estimating the 
likelihood (probability) that a software vulnerability will be exploited in the wild. The EPSS model 
produces a probability score between 0 and 1 (0 and 100%). The higher the score, the greater the 
probability that a vulnerability will be exploited. 
https://www.first.org/epss/
What is CISA KEV? 
CISA (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency) maintains the authoritative source of vulnerabilities 
that have been exploited in the wild: the Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) catalog. CISA strongly 
recommends all organizations review and monitor the KEV catalog and prioritize remediation of the 
listed vulnerabilities to reduce the likelihood of compromise by known threat actors. 
https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities
Edgescan Validated Security Score (EVSS) 
Every vulnerability discovered by Edgescan is validated via a combination of advanced “big-data” 
analytics and human expertise, resulting in near false positive-free vulnerability intelligence. Once 
a vulnerability is validated is it mapped to both the CISA KEV and EPSS to assist with prioritization. 
All vulnerabilities in Edgescan (where applicable) have a EPSS, CISA KEV, CVSS and EVSS risk score.
https://www.edgescan.com/solutions/risk-based-vulnerability-management-rbvm/
Edgescan eXposure Factor (EXF) 
The edgescan Exposure factor combines EPSS, CVSS, CISA KEV and EVSS to reach a simple priority 
score which taken in relevance with other vulnerabilities provides a simple way to prioritize 
discovered and validated vulnerabilities.
https://www.edgescan.com/edgescan-exposure-factor-exf/

The following is a breakdown of vulnerabilities by severity, discovered across the full stack; 
Web Applications, API’s and Network/Host deployments.
## Risk Density
Severity is based on Edgescan EVSS (Edgescan 
Validated Vulnerability Score). EVSS is applied to Web 
application vulnerabilities and is based upon likelihood 
& impact when a vulnerability is undergoing validation.
It also depicts the risks associated with potential 
PCI (Payment Card Industry) Failures – not every 
vulnerability results in a PCI fail. Severity is defined via 
the Edgescan Validated Security Score (EVSS). Later in 
the report we draw upon CVSS, CISA KEV and EPSS Risk 
and Probability scores.

As above, 8% of all PCI fails relate to CVE-2016-20012 which has an EPSS of 0.04% which is very low. 
The question to ponder: even though this issue will result in a PCI compliance fail, should we really be focusing 
resources on fixing other issues which are more likely to be exploited, rather than those that are currently not?

The SQL injection exploit was first documented in 1998 by cybersecurity researcher and hacker Jeff Forristal. 
His findings were published in the long running hacker zine Phrack.

Vulnerability Statistics Report 2024

The Application Security Top 10 depicts the most 
common critical risk issues discovered by Edgescan 
over the past year. SQL Injection is still the main 
contender (as was in the 2023 report), which is 
interesting to note as we can easily develop code 
(or block vectors) to mitigate such attacks. 
Detection of such vulnerabilities is also trivial using 
the correct techniques. Something which is overlooked 
quite frequently is “malicious file upload” at 7.25% of all 
High and Critical Severity vulnerabilities discovered. This 
can give rise to ransomware, malware and internal 
breach pivot points for attackers.
