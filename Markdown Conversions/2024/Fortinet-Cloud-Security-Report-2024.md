with the cloud in mind. With the majority of organizations adopting a hybrid or multi-cloud approach 
to support various use cases and work models, the attack surface has significantly broadened, 
making securing today’s cloud environments more critical and increasingly complex.
 
The 2024 Cloud Security Report, based on a comprehensive survey of 927 cybersecurity professionals 
worldwide, provides critical insights into the current trends driving cloud security. It explores key 
challenges in protecting complex cloud environments, what solutions and strategies cybersecurity 
professionals are prioritizing, how they’re allocating their resources, and the best practices they’re 
adopting to ensure the security of cloud workloads. 
Key findings include:  
-   **Multi-Cloud Preference**: A majority of organizations (78%) opt for hybrid and multi-cloud strategies 
to combine flexibility, control, and the unique benefits of various cloud services.
-   **Cloud Adoption Barriers**: Security and compliance concerns (59%) are critical roadblocks to faster 
adoption of multi-cloud strategies. Technical challenges (52%) and resource constraints (49%) 
present substantial challenges in achieving visibility and policy control within complex multi-cloud 
infrastructures and emphasize the necessity for robust cloud security expertise.
-   **Cybersecurity Talent Shortage**: Companies face a critical shortage of cybersecurity expertise, with 
93% of respondents concerned about finding qualified professionals to protect complex multi-cloud 
environments. This directly affects their security posture and strategic efforts. This persistent scarcity 
of cloud security expertise hinders faster and more widespread adoption of multi-cloud strategies.
-   **Unified Cloud Security Platform Preference**: 95% of respondents advocate for a single platform to 
streamline security across cloud environments. The objective is to simplify and automate security 
management, mitigate the talent gap, and enhance security through consistent policy enforcement 
and visibility, addressing the inefficiencies of managing multiple disparate security systems.
We would like to thank Fortinet for the invaluable support of this important industry research project.

# Introduction

Choosing the right cloud deployment strategy is critical for organizations to maximize the benefits of cloud 
computing while minimizing associated risks. 
The majority of organizations (78%) favor a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy, integrating multiple deployments into a 
single operating environment. A large portion of this (43%) use a hybrid of cloud and on-premises infrastructure. 
35% of organizations have a multi-cloud strategy, highlighting a preference for leveraging the strengths of different 
cloud service providers for a variety of use cases. Just 22% rely on a single cloud provider, suggesting a focused 
approach that simplifies management but that may increase dependency on one vendor.

The number of cloud providers an organization uses is crucial, impacting operational flexibility, risk management, 
and the complexity of security implementations. A majority of organizations (71%) use two or more cloud providers, 
indicating an approach that seeks to combine flexibility, control, and the unique benefits of each cloud service 
provider. An increase of 2 percentage points from last year’s survey reflects a growing shift towards multi-cloud 
strategies, driven by the need for specialized cloud services, regional availability, and redundancy.
Interestingly, only 29% of organizations rely on just one cloud provider, highlighting a preference for simplicity and 
perhaps a strategic partnership with a single cloud provider.
Organizations should adopt a seamless, cloud-neutral approach to securing multiple cloud environments that 
ensures consistent security policies and visibility across their digital footprint, reducing complexity and bolstering 
defense mechanisms against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.

The level of concern regarding public cloud security is a critical indicator of the cybersecurity community’s 
perception and readiness to address potential risks and threats.
Despite increasing cloud adoption, cloud security concerns show no signs of improving: a significant majority of 
96% express high levels of concern, with 37% being extremely concerned and 41% very concerned about public 
cloud security. The high degree of cybersecurity concern, which has remained consistent over the years, acts as a 
significant barrier to faster cloud adoption, as organizations grapple with the perceived risks and the complexities 
of securing cloud environments. Only a small fraction (22%) report moderate to no concern, indicating a strong 
consensus on the importance of robust security measures in public cloud deployments. 
This data aligns with the previous finding where a combined 44% of respondents perceived a higher risk of 
security breaches in public clouds compared to traditional on-premises environments. This reinforces that while 
cloud computing offers numerous benefits and grows rapidly, security remains a paramount concern.
To address these concerns, organizations should not only maintain a security-by-design approach but also invest 
in continuous monitoring, threat intelligence, and incident response capabilities specific to cloud environments. 
Adopting cutting-edge security solutions and fostering strong collaborations with cloud providers can help mitigate 
the perceived risk and concerns associated with public cloud, ensuring a secure and resilient cloud infrastructure.
