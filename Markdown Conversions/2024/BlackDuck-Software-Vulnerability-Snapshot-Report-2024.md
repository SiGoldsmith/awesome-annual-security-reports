## Executive Summary
This report analyzes data from over 200,000 dynamic application security testing (DAST) scans conducted by Black Duck on approximately 1,300 applications across 19 industry sectors from June 2023 to June 2024. The findings provide insights into the current state of security for web-based applications and systems, and the potential impact of security vulnerabilities on business operations in high-risk sectors such as Finance, Insurance, and Healthcare.

The report also examines how DAST offers a crucial complement to other security testing methods, such as static application security testing (SAST) and software composition analysis (SCA), and provides a unique perspective on application security by mimicking real-world attack scenarios.

## Key Findings
### The Vulnerability Landscape
A total 96,917 vulnerabilities were identified in scans conducted 2023–24. These are the top critical-risk vulnerabilities identified.

**Cryptographic Failures (Sensitive Data Exposure)**
These are weaknesses in how an application secures sensitive information. This category includes issues like not encrypting important data when it’s being sent over the internet, using outdated or weak encryption methods, and failing to properly protect passwords or other secret information. These failures can lead to data breaches, where attackers can steal or tamper with sensitive information such as personal details, financial data, or login credentials.

This category of weakness was found to be widespread in our DAST analysis, affecting 86% of clients and accounting for 30,726 vulnerabilities, including 4,882 critical-risk instances. This makes it one of the most common and serious security issues across industries. To address these vulnerabilities, organizations need to implement strong encryption practices, use up-to-date security protocols, and ensure that sensitive data is properly protected both when it’s being transmitted and when it’s stored.

**Injection Vulnerabilities**
This is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to insert malicious code or commands into an application, tricking it into executing unintended actions or accessing data without proper authorization. The analysis found 4,814 Injection vulnerabilities, with a high prevalence of 59% per client. This category had the second-highest number of critical vulnerabilities (2,491), indicating its potential for causing severe security breaches.

Injection vulnerabilities often occur when user input is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in database queries, operating system commands, or web page content. Common Injection attacks include SQL Injection, Command Injection, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), with successful attacks leading to data theft, unauthorized data manipulation, or even full system compromise.

To prevent Injection vulnerabilities, organizations need to implement proper input validation, use parameterized queries, and follow secure coding practices. While both SAST and DAST can detect Injection vulnerabilities, DAST is particularly effective at identifying complex, runtime-dependent issues. Regular security testing, especially using DAST, can help identify and address these vulnerabilities.

### Industry-Specific Insights
High-risk sectors included Finance and Insurance (1,299 critical vulnerabilities), Healthcare and Social Assistance (992 critical vulnerabilities), and Information Services (446 critical vulnerabilities). The Finance and Insurance industry (FSI) had the highest number of critical vulnerabilities across all site complexities, with 565 critical vulnerabilities identified for small FSI sites, 580 for medium sites, and 154 for large sites. The next-highest industry was Healthcare and Social Assistance, with 367, 486, and 139 critical vulnerabilities for small, medium, and large sites respectively.

The data indicates that small and medium-sized sites tend to have more critical vulnerabilities than larger sites, particularly in the FSI sector.

### Time-to-Close Analysis
The data shows significant variations across industries when it came to vulnerability time-to-close. For critical vulnerabilities, the Utilities industry had the longest time-to-close across all sites. The extended time-to-close for small (107 days) and medium (876 days) sites versus larger (1 day) in the Utilities sector may be due to limited cybersecurity resources and budget constraints. Utilities often operate with legacy systems that are difficult to patch and update. Large sites might have dedicated security teams and more robust processes, allowing them to address vulnerabilities more quickly.

The next-longest time-to-close was the Educational Services sector with closure times as 342 days for small sites, 111 days for medium sites, and 1 day for large sites. Small educational institutions often face budget limitations and may lack dedicated cybersecurity personnel, leading to longer times to address vulnerabilities. Large educational institutions such as major universities, however, are likely to have better-funded IT departments and more resources to quickly mitigate critical vulnerabilities.

Conversely, Finance and Insurance closed critical vulnerabilities for small sites in just 28 days, medium sites in 53 days, and large sites in 78 days. This sector is heavily regulated and deals with highly sensitive data, necessitating a rapid response to vulnerabilities. These organizations typically have substantial cybersecurity budgets and dedicated teams to ensure compliance with regulations like Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and to protect financial data.

Organizations in the Healthcare and Social Assistance sector took an average of 87 days to close critical vulnerabilities for small sites, 30 days for medium sites, and 20 days for large sites. The Healthcare sector is also highly regulated (e.g., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]) and handles sensitive patient data, which drives the need for prompt vulnerability remediation. Larger Healthcare organizations often have more resources and dedicated security teams, enabling faster closure times.

The variations in time-to-close metrics across different sectors highlight the impact of resource allocation and the challenges legacy systems can have on security initiatives. Sectors with significant regulatory pressures and sensitive data tend to act swiftly to mitigate vulnerabilities, reflecting their proactive stance. On the other hand, sectors with limited resources and budget constraints face longer exposure times, underscoring the need for tailored cybersecurity strategies and increased investment in under-resourced industries.

Black Duck analysts use a proprietary metric to rank the relative “site complexity” of applications assessed by Black Duck® Continuous Dynamic scanning. This metric is based on the number and sophistication of interactions performed during the scanning process. Applications with less complexity may have minimal interactivity and a simple crawl tree—that is, an application with a straightforward structure of URLs. Higher-complexity applications may have many interactive elements and dynamically generated content.

This metric allows our specialists to customize scan behaviors, adjusting the depth and aggression of scans based on the complexity of the application. The complexity metric can also be weighted across industries for comparison and baselining.

## Potential Business Impact Suggested by the Data
These are some of the risks of these vulnerabilities.

**Data Breaches**: Sensitive Data Exposure and Injection vulnerabilities pose significant threats to sensitive data across all industries, potentially leading to data leaks, fines, financial losses, and reputational damage. Sensitive data at risk includes personally identifiable information such as Social Security numbers, banking information, login credentials, credit card numbers, medical records, and trade secrets.

**Regulatory Noncompliance**: High-risk sectors face increased exposure to noncompliance with data protection regulations, risking severe penalties. For example, the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA) applies to critical infrastructure sectors (including FSI, Healthcare, and Waste Management among others) and requires covered entities to report covered cyber incidents and ransomware payments to CISA. PCI DSS applies to all organizations that handle credit card information and mandates security standards for protecting cardholder data. HIPAA requires protection of patient health information and mandates reporting of data breaches. For organizations handling the data of EU citizens, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires strict data protection measures and breach reporting.

**Operational Disruptions**: Widespread security misconfigurations and Denial-of-Service vulnerabilities across industry sectors threaten business continuity and service availability. Operational disruptions caused by vulnerabilities and misconfigurations can have significant consequences across sectors. In the Healthcare sector for example, some of the potential critical disruptions include
- Disruption of Life-Saving Equipment: A cyberattack that targets a hospital’s network could lead to the shutdown of critical medical devices such as ventilators, infusion pumps, and heart monitors. Patients relying on these devices for life support could face immediate life-threatening situations. For example, if ventilators are turned off, patients who cannot breathe independently may suffer severe health consequences or even death.
- Compromise of Electronic Health Records: A ransomware attack that encrypts patient records would make them inaccessible to healthcare providers. The inability to access patient histories, medication records, and treatment plans could lead to delays in care, incorrect treatments, and medication errors. This can severely impact patient outcomes, particularly in emergency situations where timely access to accurate information is critical.
- Medication Errors Due to Pharmacy System Interruptions: An exploited vulnerability in a pharmacy system could cause the system to go offline. Interruptions in the pharmacy system can lead to delays in dispensing medications, incorrect dosages, or missed treatments. This can be particularly dangerous for patients with critical conditions requiring precise medication management.

**Extended Vulnerability Exposure**: Long closure times in sectors like Utilities and Educational Services increase the risk of exploitation and potential business impact. For example, a vulnerability in the power grid control system that remains unpatched could lead to prolonged power outages affecting millions of households and businesses. In extreme cases, it could result in cascading failures across interconnected power systems, potentially causing blackouts across entire regions. A vulnerability in a water treatment plant’s control system going unaddressed could potentially alter chemical treatment processes, leading to water contamination. This could result in widespread illness, the need for extensive system flushing, and a loss of public trust in water safety.

In the Educational Services sector, an unaddressed vulnerability in a student information system could lead to the exposure of sensitive student data, including personal information, academic records, and financial details. Such a breach could result in identity theft, academic fraud, and violation of privacy laws like FERPA, leading to legal consequences and loss of trust in the institution.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings data from the over 200,000 scans conducted by Black Duck, organizations should prioritize addressing Sensitive Data Exposure (called Cryptographic Failures in the OWASP 2021 taxonomy) and Injection vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting, especially in high-risk sectors.

Organizations in all sectors should focus on reducing time-to-close for critical vulnerabilities, particularly in sectors that permit long remediation times. Security misconfigurations across all industries should be addressed to minimize potential information disclosure and reputational damage.

Overall, development and security teams should implement a multifaceted security approach integrating DAST, SAST, and SCA to achieve the most comprehensive coverage throughout the software development life cycle. The findings indicate that if such a full spectrum approach to application security testing were applied, potential exposure to critical vulnerabilities would be markedly reduced.

## Fundamentals of Dynamic Application Security Testing
DAST is a critical component in the application security landscape, particularly as organizations grapple with increasingly complex and vulnerable web applications. This section provides a comprehensive overview of DAST, its significance, and its role in a robust application security strategy.

### Key Characteristics of DAST
DAST is a black-box security testing methodology that analyzes applications in their running state, without any privileged access to that application’s design, architecture, or internals. Unlike SAST, which examines source code, DAST simulates real-world attacks on a live application, identifying vulnerabilities that may manifest only during runtime or in interactions between multiple subsystems. This approach allows DAST to detect issues such as authentication problems, server configuration errors, and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities that might be missed by other testing methods.

### DAST in the Modern Security Landscape
The relevance of DAST has grown significantly due to several factors.
- The increasing complexity of web applications: With the rise of the microservices architecture, API-driven development, and cloud-native applications, attack surfaces have expanded considerably.
- Evolving cyberthreats: As attackers become more sophisticated, DAST’s ability to simulate real-world attacks becomes invaluable.
- Regulatory compliance: Regulatory frameworks like GDPR and PCI DSS require robust, continuous security testing, making DAST an essential tool for compliance.
- DevSecOps integration: DAST’s ability to be integrated within continuous integration/ continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines aligns with modern DevSecOps practices.
- Cost implications: Early detection of vulnerabilities can significantly reduce the cost of fixing security issues after deployment.

### DAST and Other Testing Methodologies
While DAST is powerful, it’s most effective when used in conjunction with other security testing methods. For example, SAST’s strengths include early detection of coding flaws, but it may miss runtime vulnerabilities or unintended interactions between components, which can be found by DAST. Likewise, SCA identifies vulnerabilities in third-party components; DAST can verify if these vulnerabilities are exploitable in a running application.

By implementing DAST in conjunction with other testing methodologies, organizations can significantly enhance their security posture in a complex online application landscape.

The key characteristics of DAST include
- External perspective testing, mimicking an attacker’s view
- Visibility into trending behaviors
- Runtime analysis of applications
- Continuous testing
- Ability to test without access to source code

### DAST in Preproduction and Production
DAST solutions can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to identify vulnerabilities early, accelerating remediation and reducing the cost of fixes. This approach is particularly valuable for detecting issues that may manifest only in a running application, such as certain types of Injection vulnerabilities or unexpected interactions between services and components.

DAST solutions used in production offer additional benefits, especially for organizations dealing with complex, dynamic applications or those in highly regulated industries. This can also provide continuous monitoring, detecting vulnerabilities that may arise due to configuration changes, newly discovered exploits, or changes in the application’s runtime environment. It’s particularly valuable for identifying issues with third-party components that may become vulnerable over time, and for verifying the effectiveness of patches.

A combination of preproduction and production DAST testing may provide the most comprehensive security coverage for some organizations. The ideal scenario in these cases is implementing extensive preproduction DAST testing, and using production testing as a supplementary measure rather than the primary security strategy. The combination offers benefits including
- Risk mitigation: Preproduction testing eliminates the risk of unplanned downtime or data corruption in live environments.
- Cost-effectiveness: Fixing vulnerabilities earlier in the development cycle is typically much less expensive than addressing them in production.
- Developer-friendliness: Integration with IDEs and CI/CD pipelines makes security testing a natural part of the development process.
- Compliance: Many regulatory standards prefer or require testing before production deployment.
- Comprehensive testing: Preproduction environments enable more thorough and aggressive testing without fear of impacting users or data.

DAST testing in production can also be beneficial in several scenarios.
- Continuous security validation: It can act as an additional layer of security to catch any issues that might have slipped through preproduction testing.
- Detection of emerging threats: DAST can automatically detect emerging threats.
- Cloud-native applications: It is useful in production environments that may have unique configurations that are difficult to replicate in testing.
- Legacy systems: Production DAST may be more effective dealing with older applications that lack comprehensive preproduction environments.

The strategic implementation of DAST in both preproduction and production environments offers a balanced approach, allowing for thorough testing without compromising system integrity or user experience. This multifaceted strategy not only enhances vulnerability detection across various stages of the application life cycle but also addresses the unique challenges posed by diverse application architectures, from legacy systems to cloud-native applications. Ultimately, this approach enables organizations to build a more resilient security posture capable of adapting to the evolving threat landscape.


