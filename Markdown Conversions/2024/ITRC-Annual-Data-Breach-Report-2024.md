## Introduction from the President

Twenty years ago, a phone call about data breach letters sent to California residents sparked a media and public policy avalanche. Despite two decades, the root causes of most data breaches remain unaddressed. Technical and policy solutions have been ineffective in slowing the increase in events compromising information.

The data shows a lack of progress in data protection. Stolen and compromised data is so widespread that the number of unaffected individuals and businesses is dwarfed by the number of victims by a factor of five[^1].

In 2024, the record number of data breaches set in 2023 was nearly matched. Within this near-record number, several trends require discussion:

-   3,158 data compromises were tracked, resulting in over 1.3 billion notices to individuals.
-   The number of compromises is essentially flat with the previous record-breaking year, but the number of victim notices is up 211%.
-   It's impossible to know the exact number of individuals represented in that billion-plus notice count, but it averages to six alerts for every adult[^2] in the country.
-   Mandatory data breach notices are not having the intended effect of reducing breaches.

Despite the concerning trends, there is good news:

-   40% of states have adopted comprehensive privacy laws, most including mandatory cybersecurity standards.
-   More state privacy laws are expected to be introduced and passed[^3] in the absence of a uniform federal privacy law.
-   "Passkeys" technology has the potential to eliminate an entire class of cyberattacks related to stolen credentials.
-   94% of all devices are ready to use passkeys, with major providers offering access to 100% of users, according to the FIDO Alliance[^4].
-   Consumer support for passkeys is growing, with 30% of U.S. consumers using them on at least one account after one year of availability.

Key takeaways:

-   A significant number of data compromises could have been avoided with basic cybersecurity.
-   Federal and State disclosure regulations are not having the intended prevention effects, but state privacy laws may be.
-   It's difficult to quantify the impact of Artificial Intelligence on data compromises, but there are red flags.
-   The actual impact of data breaches on people is often masked by the scale of mega-breaches.

Today's password practices require users to remember credentials and organizations to store them in databases that can be compromised. Passkeys, however, can't be stolen, and users cannot self-compromise because they never know the access key.

## Glossary

-   **Data Compromise/Event:** Events where personal information is accessible by unauthorized individuals and/or for unintended purposes. Includes data breaches, data exposures, and data leaks.
-   **Attack Vector:** The method used by a threat actor to compromise an organization's data.
    -   Cyberattacks: Compromising an electronic information system using software or computer technology.
    -   Physical attacks: Compromising data through a physical act.
    -   System or Human Errors: Failures of a system or human being to perform as expected or required without malicious intent.
-   **Identity Theft:** Taking personally identifiable information (PII) as protected by law.
-   **Identity Fraud:** Using stolen personally identifiable information (PII).
-   **Industry:** Standard categories used to filter data compromises by organization type/sector and industry (based on SIC code).
-   **Data Breach:** When unauthorized individuals access and/or remove personal information from its storage location.
-   **Identity Crimes:** The overall term for a wide variety of criminal acts related to the theft and/or misuse of personal information.
-   **Data Exposure:** When personal information is available for access and/or removal, but there is no evidence of unauthorized access. Typically involves cloud-based data storage with misconfigured or unapplied cybersecurity protections.
-   **Data Leak:** When publicly available or willingly shared personal information creates risk when aggregated, especially when left unprotected.
-   **Sensitive Records:** Sensitive personal identifiable information (SPII) as defined by statute (e.g., passport numbers, SSN, driver's license, health information).
-   **Non-Sensitive Records:** Non-sensitive personal information (PII) as defined by statute (e.g., telephone numbers, email addresses, login and passwords).
- **Victim Notices:** The ITRC reports the number of Victim Notices for both individual events and as a total for all reported compromises as a measure of the scale of events and impacts on individuals. However, Victim Notices should not be considered a 1-to-1 count of actual victims since not all notices include a victim count, and those that do may not reflect the number of individuals impacted, but rather the number of accounts compromised including instances where a person has multiple accounts. Aggregated totals also inflate the number of individuals affected because of single individuals receiving breach notices from multiple events.
-   **Unknown Records:** Type of records compromised is unknown.
-   **Threat Actor:** The person or group whose malicious actions result in a data compromise.
    -   Internal actors: Employees of a compromised organization.
    -   External actor: An independent person or group.
    -   Nation/State actor: Acting on behalf of a government.

## Executive Summary

-   The number of data compromises reported in 2024 totaled 3,158, essentially flat with the previous year.
-   Compromises linked to System and Human Errors dropped by 58% year-over-year.
-   Physical Attack-related compromises dropped to a six-year low – 33 events.
-   Publicly traded companies represented only 7% of all compromised organizations (221 companies) but issued 72% of victim notices (939M).
-   Of the 133 cyberattacks against publicly traded companies resulting in a data breach notice, a stolen credential(s) was the leading attack vector. However, 99 of the 133 breached organizations (74 percent) did not list an attack vector in a breach notice.
-   The number of victim notices increased 211% year-over-year, primarily due to five (5) "mega-breaches".
-   Mega-breach victim notices totaled more than 1B of the more than 1.3B victim notices issued in 2024.
-   Financial Services was the most breached industry, followed by Healthcare, Professional Services, Manufacturing, and Technology.
-   Cyberattacks remained the primary root cause of data breaches.
-   The number of notices that did not list a specific attack vector increased significantly for the fifth consecutive year.
-   Approximately 70% of cyberattack-related breach notices did not include attack information, compared to 58% in 2023.
-   Excluding the five (5) mega-breaches, the ~224M other victim notices issued in 2024 represent a 47% decrease in victim notices compared to the previous year.

## Analysis

### Year-Over-Year

-   **Compromises & Victim Notices:** The number of data compromises reached the second-highest level since 2005 (3,158), a 1% reduction from 2023's record high.  However, the number of data breach notices (1.3B) far exceeded previous numbers due to five mega-breaches.  Adjusting for mega-breaches, regular victim notices (224M) would have been a significant drop.
-   **Sensitive vs. Non-Sensitive Records:** The data exposed skewed toward sensitive information, with a renewed focus on financial information, driver's license, and health information.
-   **Actionable vs. Non-Actionable Notices:** Information about the root cause of data breaches continued to be elusive. Almost two-thirds of all notices did not include actionable information. Notices without attack vector information increased by 20 percentage points.

### Public vs Private

-   **Compromises & Victim Notices:** Data breach notices from publicly traded companies represented less than 10% of all breach notices but 72% of victims.
-   **Attack Vectors:** Both publicly traded and privately owned businesses issued breach notices lacking root cause information. Publicly traded companies failed to report specific information 75% of the time. Private companies issued most data breach notices, 69% of which did not include attack vector details.

### Compromises by Industry

-   Financial Services surpassed Healthcare as the most compromised industry for the first time since 2018.
-   Growth in compromises in Financial Services was primarily due to a rise in attacks against Commercial Banking and Insurance entities.

### 2024 Financial Services Breakout

-   Significant rise in attacks against Commercial Banking and Insurance entities.

## 2024 Insights

### Better Cyber Practices & Requirements Could Prevent Compromises

-   At least 1965 of the compromises reported in 2024 could have been prevented, including three (3) of the five (5) mega-breaches.
-   Attacks using stolen credentials could have been blocked with Multi-factor Authentication (MFA).
-   At least 21 compromises were linked to misconfigured or non-secured cloud environments.
-   At least 114 compromises were linked to files being attached to emails or in physical correspondence.
-   At least 83 attacks were against known and unknown software flaws.
-   At least 29 cyberattacks involved "credential stuffing" attacks.
-   Passkeys offer the opportunity to all but eliminate[^6] credential stuffing and other credential-related attacks.
-   States continue to adopt comprehensive privacy laws[^8] in the absence of a federal law.
-   Small business leaders are aware of new state cybersecurity requirements but are concerned about compliance (76 percent)[^7].

### Disclosure Requirements Have No Significant Impact

-   The number of data breach notices without actionable information increased.
-   70% of data breach notices associated with cyberattacks did not contain root cause information.
-   The overall number of compromises with no root cause information grew 21 percentage points year-over-year.
-   A patchwork quilt of state laws and federal regulations with varying disclosure requirements leads to significant underreporting[^9].
-   States occasionally update their data breach notice laws in reaction to trends[^12].

### Mega-Breaches Show Scale But Often Mask Impact

-   Five mega-breaches[^13] account for only .001% of compromises but ~83% of data breach notices.
-   Adjusting for mega-breaches, data breach notices in 2024 were the lowest number since 2018.
-   Overly focusing on mega-breaches can skew consumers' sense of risk and contribute to "breach fatigue."
-   Immediate actions to take after receiving a data breach notice: Freeze credit, change passwords, set up unique passwords and MFA, sign up for credit monitoring, set up passkeys, contact the ITRC for help.

### Zero Day & Supply Chain Attacks

-   There were fewer data breaches directly linked to Zero Day and Supply Chain[^16] attacks in 2024 compared to the previous year.
-   Zero Day attacks continued to be a significant focus, with at least 17 attacks.
-   Supply Chain attacks directly impacted 134 organizations and indirectly impacted an additional 657 entities.
-   Change Healthcare, a major part of the healthcare supply chain, was breached, impacting 190M victims[^5].

### AI is Likely Impacting Compromises But Can Be Used For Prevention

-   No data breach notice directly linked AI to a compromise in 2024.
-   AI is enabling identity-related phishing attacks and identity scams that lead to data compromises[^14].
-   Threat actors are gearing up to launch a new wave of attacks fueled by AI[^15].
-   AI also offers defenders opportunities to improve detection, defenses, and remediation.

[^13]: Advanced Auto Parts was among customers of a popular cloud data storage platform where more than 100 companies were breached that did not require multi-factor authentication for account access, a basic cybersecurity tool that could have prevented the attack from succeeding. Initial reports from security researchers and claims from the threat actors who attacked Advanced Auto Parts indicated ~380M customer and company accounts were compromised that included personal information. While security researchers claim customer information was included in the stolen information, Advanced Auto Parts filed a breach notice with the State of Maine stating the personal information of only ~2.3M current and former employees as well as job applicants was compromised. The ITRC initially reported the higher number of victims, but has updated the information regarding the Advanced Auto Parts breach to reflect the lower number of victim notices in keeping with our revised victim count methodology.
[^14]: Because 2,065 of the 3,158 public data compromise reports in 2024 did not include information about the root cause of the data compromise, it is not possible to determine precisely how many events were linked to phishing attacks.
