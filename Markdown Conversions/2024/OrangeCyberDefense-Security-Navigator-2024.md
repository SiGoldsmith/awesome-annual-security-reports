# Foreword
Security Navigator 
2024
Research-driven insights 
to build a safer digital society
We are very pleased to provide to the cyber security 
community the next edition of the Security Navigator. 
Our position as part of one of the largest telecom 
operators in the world, and as a leader in cyber security 
services and research, gives us profound insights. It 
has become our custom to share this unique view of the 
cyber security landscape.
There is no denying that this has been a year of 
fundamental changes for most of us. 
Geopolitical disorder has hit countries and society 
at probably the worst possible time and will severely 
decelerate recovery after COVID for years. The digital 
world is becoming a virtual battleground for state-
backed APT groups and political hacktivists. Not only 
businesses, but whole economies find themselves 
being targeted for political reasons, or at risk of 
becoming collateral damage. Shifting the focus from 
monetary gain to mere destruction of "the enemy" has 
left the threat landscape in turmoil. 
But aside from all the crisis we are also on the brink of 
yet another technological revolution. With incredible 
speed Generative Artificial Intelligence has started to 
impact and shift the way we think about and interact 
with computer technology. The transformative power 
this has on shaping our economy, security and our 
everyday life is yet to be determined.
Being aware of one’s vulnerabilities is key to avoid 
becoming the weak link. We all must join our efforts to 
build up resilience and protect the digital space. Not 
only for ourselves, but for our customers, suppliers, 
employees and the community. Hence our mission is to 
build a safer digital society. CISOs do that every day.
This is not an easy job. Cyber security is complex. 
Keeping track of technological evolution means to 
constantly re-learn, re-evaluate and re-educate yourself 
and your peers. At Orange Cyberdefense we are 
tirelessly working to offer you the best guidance and 
support along this way. 
With that goal in mind, our multi-disciplinary experts 
have digested all this unique information and 
synthesized our key findings in this report, to the 
benefit of our clients and of the broader cyber security 
community. These insights are also crucial for us to 
keep being relevant as a company. 
Trends got confirmed, others are emerging. 
Cyberextortion emerges as the most prominent form 
of attack with a strong increase in the past year and 
a geographical shift towards EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
Small and medium companies are gaining ground as 
favourite vulnerable targets. Insightful observations like 
that should help us navigate the threat landscape – as 
a closely-knit community. We are proud and humbled 
every day to be trusted with the security of our clients’ 
most important assets, and we are deploying the best 
expertise and technology in all domains to protect their 
business.
Thank you for your trust and we hope you enjoy reading 
this edition of the Security Navigator!

# Introduction: What you need to know.
Introduction
The Security Navigator reflects first and foremost the reality 
of the conflictual nature of cyber warfare. It mirrors the 
disinhibition of threat actors motivated by state strategies 
or hacktivism as well as criminal opportunities. In this 
environment, espionage, sabotage, disinformation and 
extortion are becoming increasingly intertwined. 
The long-term state of war on Europe's doorstep, the risks of 
polarization of the Hamas-Israel war, and the rise in tensions in 
the Indo-Pacific arc all remind us that security remains and will 
remain even more so tomorrow at the heart of organizations' 
technological and human development strategies.
This unstable and unpredictable environment must convince 
us of the need to unwaveringly pursue a policy of prevention 
and support for our increasingly interconnected organizations. 
We must integrate the major comparative advantage of an 
independent analysis of cyber threats in its technical and 
geopolitical dimensions in order to refine organizational cyber 
risk management. Equally we must complement it with a cyber 
crisis management capability firmly anchored in corporate 
governance.
I also feel it is necessary to stress the extent to which 
the sovereignty of our data and its use, as well as the 
implementation of standards, will gradually become necessary 
to frame our security policies. 
It is in this context that Orange Cyberdefense regularly reviews 
the state of the threat. Once again this year, it is thanks to 
the incidents investigated by our security monitoring centers 
(SOCs and CyberSOCs), the vulnerability scans carried out by 
our Vulnerability Operations Center (VOC), the reports of our 
teams carrying out penetration tests, and finally, our network 
analyses  that our Security Navigator 2024 is born. 
Our very singular ability to gather data from very different 
sources both within Orange and externally, cross-referencing 
and analyzing them assures the relevance of this report. 
Data from the Security Navigator 2024 highlights a few trends, 
including:
	
- A dynamic cybercrime ecosystem, that expands its 
operational mode by directly targeting company personnel 
in order to better penetrate their systems. 
	
- Cyber criminals accelerating the geographical 
lateralization of their attacks, targeting not only Anglo-
Saxon countries or Europe which nevertheless are still 
strongly impacted. 
	
- An increase in cyberattacks that should be seen on 
mobile devices, where our personal and business data are 
increasingly concentrated.
	
- Continued targeting of Scientific and Technical IP, 
the financial sector, and particularly of Industrial and 
Manufacturing infrastructure.
	
- An explosion of Cyber hacktivism over the past two years 
to support political or social demands.
Today, the Security Navigator is one of the central elements of 
Orange Cyberdefense’s threat analysis, insights of which must 
go beyond Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and 
security experts. It is complemented by the ‘Executive Security 
Navigator’, a dedicated report intended to support them in 
raising awareness and driving actions with their organization’s 
leadership, anchored on the reality of the risks induced by this 
cyber threat.
This document is also intended to become the cornerstone 
of the partnership of trust that we wish to build with you. It 
must enrich our debates within a community that is still too 
isolated. For example, we invite you to take advantage of all 
our analytical capabilities through articles reflecting on the 
importance of the human factor in an attack, and stories from 
our response teams, in order to continue to acculturate your 
environment on cyber security.
Above all, it emphasizes the extent to which in our common 
technological adventure, people and security must be our 
primary concern.
I hope you enjoy reading!

# Summary: This is what happened
We’ve never used the word ‘unprecedented’ in a Security Navigator 
before, and we won’t do it this year either. But there’s no denying 
that the 12 months of cybersecurity captured in this report have 
been extraordinary.
The tempo, the severity, the complexity, and the consequences of 
developments in our domain have accelerated to dizzying levels. 
Our World Watch service published 491 advisories for the period 
October 2022 through September 2023, averaging over 40 
advisories per month. No advisories with Urgency Critical were 
issued for the period. This is somewhat astonishing given the almost 
overwhelming scale and frequency of security ‘drama’ that occupied 
our minds. Yet the CISOs we speak to universally wear a kind of 
‘thousand yard’ stare and report being nearly overwhelmed by the 
ferocity of the security news cycle.
No single effort could hope to capture, comprehend, and convey 
all the security industry has seen and learned since we last 
published this report. Instead, we aim to share what we at Orange 
Cyberdefense have observed or considered first-hand. We 
cross-reference and analyze the data we collect from our diverse 
operations and own research. We describe the pictures we see in 
that data and share our efforts to answer the questions it raises 
for us. With this somewhat lopsided effort we hope to illuminate in 
some small way those parts of the landscape we can shine a light 
on, and present insights and observations we hope will enable 
security practitioners to make better-informed decisions that deliver 
the positive security outcomes our digital world desperately needs. 
We begin with a summary of key events, themes and observations.

# Expert Voice Sweden: The power of GRC principles
How governance, risk and compliance (GRC) can 
shape the backbone of your security strategy
While many organizations may work with these three elements individually, the true power 
of GRC principles lies in their ability to synergize with each other and, at the same time, 
harmoniously align with business objectives and strategic goals. 
Together, the GRC principles form a holistic, strategic, and protective ”umbrella” that 
safeguards critical areas, including OT Security and Mobile Device Security, against a 
broad spectrum of cyber threats. 
Margarita Sallinen, Information Security Consultant, Orange Cyberdefense
Adapting to complex cyber threats
Cyber threats range from well-established approaches like 
phishing attacks to emerging ones like Cyber Extortion, 
hacktivism and AI-driven attacks by cybercriminals. In addition 
to providing comprehensive defense, GRC principles offer a 
strategic framework for mitigating financial and reputational 
risks while preserving an organization's brand. Achieved 
through governance, robust risk management, and stringent 
compliance measures, this approach enables organizations to 
navigate the complex domain of cyber threats with resilience 
and confidence. 
It's not 'just a tech problem'
Cybersecurity is usually associated with tech, code, firewalls, 
and encryption algorithms. But equating security with 
technology is a misconception; and implementing solutions 
alone can lead to a false sense of protection. Of course 
deploying the right tools and having the appropriate expertise 
to respond and recover from cyber security incidents is 
essential. However, as risks have grown more intricate, and 
threats more pervasive, technology alone is not sufficient to 
ensure cyber resilience.
As cyber threats evolve, they introduce new challenges, 
spanning from Operational Technology (”OT”) risks, 
encompassing critical infrastructure, to vulnerabilities 
associated with Mobile Device Security, which impact nearly 
every employee. Within this evolving threat landscape, 
organizations now face consequences such as breaches, 
financial losses, and reputational damage, prompting them to 
carefully consider where to direct their cybersecurity efforts. 
Therefore, it has become imperative to zoom out and adopt a 
broader, and more comprehensive perspective.
The Critical role of the C-suite 
Leadership, including the Board and C-suite executives, 
plays a pivotal role in adopting the GRC framework into the 
organization's cybersecurity strategy. Cybersecurity resilience 
should start in the boardroom.

Understanding GRC Principles
For an organization's cybersecurity strategy to excel, GRC 
should rightfully claim the spotlight. To gain a comprehensive 
understanding of this framework and unlock its benefits, it's 
essential to delve into the individual GRC principles first.
To summarize: governance sets the direction; risk management identifies potential 
obstacles; and compliance ensures cybersecurity practices remains lawful and ethical. 
Five practical GRC implementation tips
While understanding the individual GRC principles is important, practical implementation blending all 
three is where organizations can be most effective.
1. Define Clear Governance Policies
Establish comprehensive governance policies that clearly define roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes 
related to cybersecurity. Ensure alignment with your organization's strategic objectives. Engage key stakeholders, 
including leadership, IT teams, and legal departments, in policy development.
2. Conduct a Cybersecurity Risk Assessment
Start by identifying your organization's unique cybersecurity risks. Understand the threats you face, the vulnerabilities 
in your systems, and the potential impact of security incidents. This assessment serves as the foundation for tailored 
governance, risk management, and compliance strategies.
3. Stay Compliant
Continuously monitor and maintain compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards. This includes 
conducting regular audits and assessments to ensure adherence to cybersecurity best practices. Keep abreast of 
regulatory changes that may impact your organization.
4. Foster a Cybersecurity Culture
Promote a culture of cybersecurity awareness and responsibility throughout the organization. Train employees to 
recognize and respond to threats effectively. Encourage reporting of security incidents and near misses.
5. Continuously Evaluate and Improve
Cybersecurity is an ongoing journey. Regularly assess the effectiveness of your GRC principles and make adjustments 
as needed. Conduct post-incident reviews to identify areas for improvement.
Key takeaways
The Power of GRC in cybersecurity is realized when Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance 
(GRC) principles synergize, while aligning with business objectives. This holistic approach yields 
multiple benefits, including the minimization of operational inefficiencies, improved communication, 
and enhanced risk mitigation. GRC principles play a pivotal role in this context, offering a 
comprehensive framework that bridges technology with strategic goals.
GRC principles not only protect critical areas but also mitigate financial and reputational risks. 
Leadership's commitment, especially in the boardroom, is crucial to fostering a culture of cyber 
resilience. 
	
 Redefining the 
	
 Cybersecurity Strategy
To effectively adapt to and navigate the shifting threat 
landscape, organizations must transcend the boundaries 
of traditional IT-focused cybersecurity strategies. Instead of 
relying solely on reactive measures and asking, "Why would 
it happen to us?" organizations should embrace a holistic 
approach grounded in resilience and proactive measures. They 
should recognize the profound importance of Governance, 
Risk Management, and Compliance (”GRC”) principles as a 
foundational framework for cybersecurity.
A strong commitment to cybersecurity initiatives drives 
substantial change and fosters a resilient cybersecurity culture, 
seamlessly integrating cybersecurity with strategic planning 
rather than treating it as an afterthought.
C-suite executives must champion GRC principles in 
cybersecurity, and send a clear message throughout the 
organization that cybersecurity is not merely a technical 
concern but a critical aspect of risk management and corporate 
governance. This mindset should permeate every department, 
from the boardroom to employees handling sensitive 
information, ultimately creating a culture of cyber resilience. 
When the boardroom treats cybersecurity as a strategic 
business imperative it sets the expected behavior for 
the rest of the organization. 
	
Governance: 
	
The Strategic Compass 
Governance is the strategic compass for 
an organization's cybersecurity, aligning 
the strategy with the given objectives. It 
sets clear goals, policies, and proactive 
strategies. For example, in safeguarding 
customer data, governance establishes 
policies like encryption, access controls, 
and incident response plans, aligning 
cybersecurity with broader business 
strategies to protect the organization 
against emerging threats.
	
Risk Management:
	
The Agile Watchdog
Risk management is like a vigilant 
cybersecurity watchdog. It entails 
proactively identifying, assessing and 
mitigating risks. Anticipating and enabling 
preventive measures to minimize their 
impact is also essential. Risk management 
can entail threat modeling and developing 
countermeasures, effectively bolstering 
incident response capabilities. 
	
Compliance:
	
The Steadfast Lighthouse
Compliance, like a dependable lighthouse, 
ensures organizations navigate the 
complexities of the cyber domain while 
upholding legal and ethical standards. 
It encompasses adherence to laws, 
regulations, and standards, verified 
through regular audits. When new 
regulations arise, compliance involves 
reviewing processes, updating policies, 
and conducting audits to maintain legality, 
ethics, and enhance incident response as 
per regulatory expectations.

# Basic Data analysis: Key data of the year
We collect and analyze two fundamental forms of data for the 
Security Navigator: data produced by our internal operations – 
Threat Detection, Security Intelligence, Vulnerability Scanning and 
Ethical Hacking – and data we collect specifically for research 
purposes, namely Cyber Extortion victims, (limited) Hacktivism 
attacks. 
In this chapter we present an analysis of each of these data sources 
individually, then also apply this data elsewhere in the report to 
answer specific research questions.

Types of incidents
We announced in our previous report that we were in the 
process of adopting the industry standard VERIS (Vocabulary 
for Event Recording and Incident Sharing) framework for 
incident classification across our SOCs. This has now been 
rolled out to the majority of our CyberSOCs, meaning most of 
the data in scope for this report now uses this classification 
framework, allowing us to provide analysis based solely on 
VERIS. 
Threat Actions
The Threat Action categories used in the VERIS framework 
consist of the following 7 primary categories:
Malware
Malware is any malicious software, script, or code run on a 
device that alters its state or function without the owner’s 
informed consent. Examples include viruses, worms, spyware, 
keyloggers, backdoors, etc.
Hacking 
Hacking is defined within VERIS as all attempts to intentionally 
access or harm information assets without (or exceeding) 
authorization by circumventing or thwarting logical security 
mechanisms. This includes brute force, SQL injection, 
cryptanalysis, denial of service attacks, etc.
Social 
Social tactics employ deception, manipulation, intimidation, etc 
to exploit the human element, or users, of information assets. 
Includes pretexting, phishing, blackmail, threats, scams, etc.
Misuse 
Misuse is defined as the use of entrusted organizational 
resources or privileges for any purpose or manner contrary 
to that which was intended. Includes administrative abuse, 
use policy violations, use of non-approved assets, etc. These 
actions can be malicious or non-malicious in nature. Misuse 
is exclusive to parties that enjoy a degree of trust from the 
organization, such as insiders and partners.
Physical 
Physical actions encompass deliberate threats that involve 
proximity, possession, or force. Includes theft, tampering, 
snooping, sabotage, local device access, assault, etc.
Error 
Error broadly encompasses anything done (or left 
undone) incorrectly or inadvertently. Includes omissions, 
misconfigurations, programming errors, trips and spills, 
malfunctions, etc.
Environmental
Environmental not only includes natural events such as 
earthquakes and floods, but also hazards associated with 
the immediate environment or infrastructure in which assets 
are located. The latter encompasses power failures, electrical 
interference, pipe leaks, and atmospheric conditions.
A global view
As always, we strive to provide a global overview of what we 
are seeing in our incident data with the aim being to highlight 
trends that can also be applied to the global threat landscape. 
To facilitate this, a broad data set is collected from across all of 
the operational teams within Orange Cyberdefense including 
our 14 CyberSOCs responsible for supporting customers 
around the globe.
Following in the same vein as recent Security Navigator reports, 
we again have the luxury of utilizing a whole years’ worth of 
Managed Threat Detection Services data, 1st October 2022 to 
30th September 2023. This year’s report however will be the 
first time we have had a full year’s worth of data based on using 
the VERIS framework to better categorize our incidents.
Events, Incidents, 
Confirmed Incidents
A note on terminology: we log an event that has met certain 
conditions and is thus considered an Indicator of Compromise, 
Attack or Vulnerability. An Incident is when this logged Event, or 
several Events, are correlated or flagged for investigation by a 
human – our security analysts. 
An Incident is considered ‘Confirmed’ when, with help of the 
customer or at the discretion of the analyst, we can determine 
that security was indeed compromised. We refer to these 
‘Confirmed’ incidents in this report as ‘True Positives’. 
True Legitimate incidents are those that were raised but, after 
consultation with the customer, proved to be legitimate activity. 
Incidents are categorized as 'False Positive' when a false alarm 
was raised.
Because individual SOCs or clients may have slightly different 
approaches to defining Incident status, we simplify these 
categories to ‘Confirmed’ and ‘Other’ in parts of this report.
Actor
THREAT ACTORS are entities that cause 
or contribute to an incident.
Action
THREAT ACTION describe what the 
threat actor(s) did to cause or contribute 
to the incident.
Asset
ASSET describes the information assets 
that were compromised during the 
incident.
Attribute 
(CIA)
Which security ATTRIBUTES were 
compromised during the incident?

Totals
In total 129,395 incidents were recorded, all of which were 
investigated by human security analysts in one of our 
CyberSOCs. These investigations resulted in 25,076 ‘True 
Positive’ confirmed security incidents being raised with our 
customers - 19% of all the incidents we investigated. The other 
incidents comprised of 10% ‘True Legitimates’ and 58% ‘False 
Positives’ with the remaining 13% having inconclusive status.
We are happy to say that our client base has grown from last 
year with data from 44.5% more clients being included in this 
report. This relatively large growth in dataset however actually 
resulted in only 25,076 confirmed incidents, a decrease of 14% 
in the confirmed incidents from last year’s report.
This translated into an average number of 23.6 confirmed 
incidents per month/customer over the past 12 months. 
This is a significant decrease from the figure of 42.7 we 
recorded for the same period last year, primarily due to 
the configuration of clients in this dataset, and internal 
operational efficiencies.
Historically we have always seen Malware to be one of the two 
highest detected true positive incident types, this year though 
it has slipped to third with just 13%, dropping from 16.5% of 
VERIS classified incidents seen last year which saw it joint 
second with Misuse. The Misuse category was again second 
with 17.28%, almost exactly in line with last year’s report. 
It’s important to remember though that Misuse does not 
necessarily equate to malicious activity with intent to cause 
harm or loss, it could equally be an unintentional breach of 
a policy. With this being the first time we present full year of 
VERIS data, we reserve speculation on shifts until we have 
another full year for comparison.
Just as we saw last year, Hacking remains in the top spot, 
however this year it accounts for almost a third of confirmed 
incidents with 30.32%, which is a relatively significant increase 
on the 25% previously seen. Incidents categorized as Error 
(7.33%) again take fourth place and Social (7.15%) completes 
the top 5. 
Whilst ‘Error’ does not always imply a security incident it can 
easily be a precursor to one, especially with the rapid migration 
to cloud environments and the complexities involved with their 
configurations for example, whereby a simple misconfiguration 
could easily leave private data exposed. 
The Social category covers any attempt to deceive, manipulate 
or otherwise abuse employees. The obvious tactic here is 
any form of phishing or Business Email Compromise (BEC). 
Social attacks of this kind are difficult to identify in detection 
data – where we observe the effect rather than the cause of 
an activity. This threat vector is therefore probably under-
represented in this datasource.

If we add a second level of detail to the top level VERIS Threat 
category, we can see a more granular view of the underlying 
cause of the incidents our analysts have investigated. The 
top three combined incident types, Web Attack (Hacking), 
Unapproved hardware/software/script/workaround (Misuse) 
and Port Scan (Hacking), in the above chart make up over 
45% of all categorized Incidents. All three of these combined 
incident types remain in the same places as in the previous 
Navigator report, however all three did increase their 
percentage share of incidents quite considerably.
Web Attacks are where an attacker will try and abuse 
a weakness or vulnerability in a website or web-based 
application. These will commonly include SQL injection and 
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), as well as Cross-Site Request 
Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
The sub-action of “Unapproved hardware/software/script/
workaround”, which is a form of Misuse, again features in the 
top 3 combined incident types we detected, with 14%. In our 
data we saw Misuse incidents which covered activities such as:
	
- Suspicious PowerShell/CMD command line detected
	
- Honeytoken activity 
	
- Hacking tool detected
	
- Proxy Bypass: TOR, anonymization or other
	
- High volume of data transferred to removable storage
	
- Malware detected on USB devices
	
- Connection toward a known suspicious domain/IP 
address
	
- Network reconnaissance or host scan detected
	
- Potential phishing link clicked
It’s worth remembering that this combination would also 
cover so-called shadow IT. This is where employees deploy 
or use hardware (or software) that has not been approved or 
provisioned by the organization. The motivation is usually to 
bypass certain restrictions, hence this is done without the 
involvement of the IT department who would ensure correct 
and secure configuration. 
External Port Scans are a very common activity and are 
used by “legitimate” services such as Shodan or Censys for 
example. 
However, they are also a common technique used by threat 
actors in the reconnaissance phase of an attack.
Incident sources and targets
As the flow chart at the start of this chapter illustrates, we see 
an almost equal proportion of incidents being attributed to 
Internal and External Actors. This is a notable shift away from 
last year, when Internal 'actors' featured more prominently. This 
is a trend worth noting. 
End user devices are (predictably) the most common assets 
impacted. These endpoints remain the cold-face for most 
contemporary attacks. But Servers also feature prominently, 
and there is a general sense that attackers are reviving the 'lost' 
art of exploiting services over the internet.
