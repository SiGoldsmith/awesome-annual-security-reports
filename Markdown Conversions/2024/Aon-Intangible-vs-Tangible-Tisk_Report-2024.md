## Introduction
### A. Evolution of Intangible Risks
Generative artificial intelligence and cybersecurity are the top CEO concerns according to a 2024 survey[^1]. While the European Union’s new artificial intelligence law[^2] was designed to bridge the gap between concerned intellectual property creators and AI providers, the measure may actually embolden copyright holders to go to court.[^3] Additional 2024 intangible assets-related studies suggested the following:

### B. Insurance helps to drive Intangible Asset Safety
Insurance mandates superior risk management practices and facilitates lower Total Cost of Risk[^17] for today’s evolving intangible assets. Increased safety resilience in artificial intelligence, cyber-related products/services, intellectual property and evolving technology digital assets/services might be rewarded with:

- Superior insurance coverage and lower premium options, which protects organizations’ balance sheets against catastrophic losses;
- Third party, independent underwriters’ review (and suggestions for improvements) of intangible asset providers’ and users’ risk management;
- A stamp of insurance carrier risk management verification, which differentiates organizations to meet customer contract requirements and satisfy regulatory obligations; and
- Risk capital[^18] and human capital[^19] service providers forced[^20] to be more creative in terms of coverage,[^21] sources of capital[^22] and innovative solutions.[^23]

[^17]: = Risk Financing + Loss Costs (Direct and Indirect) + Administrative Costs + Taxes and Fees (insurance buyers often focus too much on premium and not enough on comprehensive customized and “in-context” coverage and vetting reliable Insurers) whereby Risk Financing Costs include all insurance premiums and attendant costs; Direct Costs of Losses includes deductibles and claims that are anticipated and funded inside the organization’s risk financing program (e.g., captive, deductible, or self-insurance programs); Indirect Loss Costs are a corresponding expense that is unfunded and, in some cases, unanticipated; Administrative Costs include claims management, risk control, and all other project costs such as data analytics; Taxes and fees are the various state taxes attached to insurance placements and are paid to governmental and regulatory bodies (e.g., state surplus lines or admission fees).

### C. Better Decisions for Intangible Asset Investment and Protection
The most valuable organizations make risk management cost-benefit decisions predicated upon quantifiable, objective, fact-based data. The return on intangible assets investment is unclear[^24]. The estimated ROI magnitude range is enormous[^25]. A February 2024 report states that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman seeks to raise up to $7 trillion, which had many tech-industry observers raising eyebrows. The amount easily exceeds the market cap of any company—including Microsoft, which recently hit $3.1 trillion and surged past Apple as America’s most valuable company.[^26]

Similarly, the range of estimates regarding frequency and severity of potential losses from intangible assets is enormous[^27]. The insurance industry typically builds actuarial loss models based on decades of data.[^28]

[^24]: After OpenAI launched Sora — a text-to-video AI model that converts text into a high-quality video up to a minute long -- a video of Meta Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun went viral in which he said at Davos 2024 that he believes: “The future of AI is not generative.”

[^27]: “If I were advising governments, I would say that there’s a 10 per cent chance AI will wipe out humanity in the next 20 years. I think that would be a reasonable number,” Geoffrey Hinton, godfather of AI “Will Digital Intelligence Replace Biological Intelligence.”
[^28]: Will AI Destroy the World? If Not, How Will It Affect Insurance? - Today’s General Counsel (todaysgeneralcounsel.com)

However, due to the dynamic and fluid nature of intangible assets, we will never have decades worth of static intangible assets and risks data. Therefore, “retain risk” versus “transfer risk” decisions require fresh thinking.[^29] Compliance with accepted industry standards should be the minimum baseline.[^30]

In this report, we compare the relative:

- Value of certain tangible[^31] compared to certain intangible assets[^32]
- Quantification of potential losses from tangible compared to intangible assets
- Insurance protection of tangible compared to intangible assets

[^29]: The most calamitous failures of prediction usually have a lot in common. We focus on those signals that tell a story about the world as we would like it to be, not how it really is. We ignore the risks that are hardest to measure, even when they pose the greatest threats to our well-being. We make approximations and assumptions about the world that are much cruder than we realize. We abhor uncertainty, even when it is an irreducible part of the problem we are trying to solve.” Silver, Nate. The Signal and the Noise: Why Most Predictions Fail – but Some Don’t. United States.

[^31]: Property, Plant & Equipment (“PP&E”)
[^32]: Information assets, intellectual property, and related digital technology, such as artificial intelligence. Additional intangible assets that lack physical substance are beyond the scope of this study, such as goodwill, brand equity, ESG (aon-2023-impact-report.pdf), DE & I, licensing, and (except as included within the calculation of trade secrets), customer lists and research and development. An intangible asset is identifiable when it is capable of being separated and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or together with a related contract; or arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the entity or from other rights and obligations.

How can organizations make better decisions regarding allocation of their finite resources to protect against tangible and intangible perils? At its most basic, insurance is a financial instrument — a way to manage the cost of future risk. It’s pretty simple. On the one hand, you can self-insure risk, holding onto it yourself and bearing the full cost of a loss (unless you have transferred it contractually in an indemnity agreement with a counterparty). Or you can pay an insurance company a premium to take some or all of that risk from you. The biggest challenges to address intangible assets risks are identification/quantification of the exposures and then taking a different, proactive mindset to mitigate such risks.

For example, there are recent studies that set forth the relative ROI of various cyber risk management mechanisms. Allocating cyber resiliency resources based on their relative increase/decrease effect on expected losses is a better decision-making mindset. The following chart sets forth factors that decrease/increase the total cost of a data breach on an average relative basis.[^33]

Given the intersection of tangible and intangible assets in many instances with the advent of the Internet of Things/5G,[^34] growth of AI robotics, metaverse/Web 3.0,[^35] virtual reality gaming, quantum computing, blockchain,[^36] etc. it is difficult to separate the actuarial modelling of intangible and tangible risks – but it is necessary and useful. For instance, the tangible assets of Property, Plant & Equipment (despite lower relative value) are insured three times greater (60 percent vs 19 percent) than information assets.[^37]

Cyberattacks, especially ransomware[^38] are surging[^39] despite increased cyber security.[^40] Yet, cyber insurance pricing continues to decrease due to insurance carrier competition. Something has got to give.

Generative AI, which creates material such as images, music and text, results in perils such as intellectual property infringement,[^41] hallucinations,[^42] security/privacy breaches[^43] and bias[^44] garnering most of the litigation news. However, some developing AI products, such as AI robots, face perils that are different from content misinformation, such as mistakes that can lead to bodily injury and/or tangible property damage. AI raises particular risk transfer challenges because AI exposures may implicate potential losses that do not fit neatly in to existing insurance buckets.[^45] Courts may struggle to extend or limit existing tort/case, statutory and contract law with respect to AI. Where there are multiple AI providers, users, vendors, distributors, customers and others in the supply chain,[^46] allocation of liability looms large.

Furthermore, most traditional insurance policies do not explicitly address AI-related risks. Insureds should clarify the scope of coverage and potential exclusions. The “silent cyber” cases, whereby historical property, crime, and general liability policies did not affirmatively “cover” or “exclude” cyber perils, resulted in extensive litigation between insurance companies and insureds.

Insurance policies address artificial intelligence perils in one of three ways:

- Affirmative coverage[^47]
- Specific exclusions[^48]
- Silent,[^49] which creates ambiguity[^50]

Risk management typically considers frequency and severity of perils. With respect to intangible assets (especially artificial intelligence and cyber), we should add velocity of evolving risk profiles. Organizations must proactively address intangible risks through tailored insurance policies that align with their unique circumstances.[^51] As the intangible assets landscape continues to evolve, a collaborative effort between stakeholders,[^52] led by legal counsel, risk management, finance/treasury, business units, information technology, and compliance - and mandated by management - is crucial to help ensure that the potential perils of intangible assets are effectively managed and mitigated.

Interestingly, the S&P companies that cited “AI” on Q4 2023 earnings calls have seen a better average stock price performance over the past 12 months compared to the S&P 500 companies that did not.[^53]

[^51]: Note that procuring a robust cyber insurance program could be a consideration in determining whether a cyber incident is “material” for purposes of the new SEC four day mandatory disclosure rule (Aon | Financial Services Group - SEC Sharpens Focus on Cybersecurity with New Disclosure Rule). For instance, assume that two organizations in the same industry, geography and revenue band suffer an identical cyber incident = $25 million in potential losses each. Company “A” has a $50 million limits cyber insurance program and Company “B” declined to purchase cyber insurance due to budget cuts (and Company “B” does not have any other insurance policy that addresses the loss). There is an argument that Company “A” may not be required to disclose the cyber incident as “material” (because it is protected against the loss by its cyber insurance policy) while Company “B” not only has to disclose the incident within 4 days, but will also suffer the uninsured $25 million hit to its balance sheet.

Most organizations (67 percent of respondents) use or intend to use (19 percent) artificial intelligence (AI) products or services. There is growing interest in adopting AI to strengthen their organizations’ security posture. According to a recent Ponemon Institute study, AI improves IT security staff’s productivity and the ability to detect previously undetectable threats.[^54] Sixty-four percent of respondents say their organizations use or plan to use (21 percent) cryptocurrency or non-fungible token assets.

The Valuation of PP&E, Information Assets and Probable Maximum Loss (PML)

The value of Information Assets Probable Maximum Loss (“PML”) [^55] is higher than PP&E. Organizations estimate the average PML resulting from stolen or destroyed information at approximately $1,155 million. In contrast, the average value of the largest loss that could result from damage or total destruction of PP&E is approximately $846 million. Business disruption has a greater impact on information assets ($324 million)[^56] than on PP&E ($144 million).

The value of information assets is higher than tangible asset values. The average total value of information assets is $1,239 million, which is slightly higher thanthe average total value of PP&E, which is approximately $1,088 million for the organizations represented in this research.

The likelihood of a loss is higher for information assets than for PP&E. Organizations estimate the likelihood that they will sustain a loss relating to information assets totaling no more than 50 percent of PML over the next 12 months at 5 percent and 100 percent of PML at 3 percent. The likelihood of a loss relating to PP&E totaling no more than 50 percent of PML over the next 12 months is an average of 2 percent and at 100 percent of PML it is 0.55 percent.

Insurance coverage is higher for tangible assets (PP&E) than for intangible assets (information assets). On average, approximately 60 percent of PP&E assets are covered by insurance and approximately 32 percent of PP&E are self-insured. While the likelihood of a loss is higher for information assets than for PP&E, only an average of 19 percent of information assets are covered by insurance, while self-insurance is higher for information assets at 58 percent.

Thirty percent of respondents believe no disclosure of a material loss to information assets not covered by insurance is required. This is a stunning data point given that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s new Form 8-K rules for reporting material cybersecurity incidents took effect (other than for smaller reporting companies) December 18, 2024.[^57] In contrast, only 14 percent of respondents believe no disclosure of a material loss to PP&E assets not covered by insurance is required.

Forty-two percent of respondents say their organizations would disclose a material loss to information assets and PP&E in a footnote in the financial statements. Twenty-one percent of respondents would disclose a material loss to PP&E as a contingent liability on the balance sheet (FASB 5) and only 13 percent would disclose a material loss to information assets as a contingent liability on the balance sheet.

[^56]: While the survey results suggest Probable Maximum Loss at approximately $324 million, a growing number of organizations are using Risk Decision Platform Analysis and Cyber Modeling to suggest potential losses in excess of $500 million to over $1 billion and are seeking cyber insurance limit premium quotes and policy terms for such amounts.

A High-level Overview of the Consolidated Global Findings

## Key Findings
This report features the consolidated findings of all regions in this research. Separate reports will be created for the North America, EMEA, Asia-Pac and LATAM regions. The complete global consolidated audited findings are presented in the Appendix of this report.

All respondents are familiar with the cyber risks facing their company. In the context of this research, cyber risk means any risk of financial loss, disruption or damage to the reputation of an organization from some sort of failure of its information technology systems.[^66] We have organized the report according to the following topics:

- The Valuation of Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E), Information Assets and Probable Maximum Loss (PML)
- Cyber Risk Exposures Increase
- The Use of Cyber Insurance to Mitigate the Financial Consequences of Data Breaches and Security Exploits
- The Vulnerability of IP Assets

### The Valuation of Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E), Information Assets and Probable Maximum Loss (PML)
Organizations continue to value information assets slightly higher than they do PP&E. According to Figure 1, on average, the total value of PP&E, including all fixed assets plus SCADA and industrial control systems is

[^66]: Source: Institute of Risk Management

approximately $1,088 million for the organizations represented in this research. The average total value of information assets, which includes customer records, employee records, financial reports, analytical data, source code, models, methods and other intellectual properties, is slightly higher, at $1,239 million.

![Image description: Figure 1. The total value of PP&E and information assets. Extrapolated value ($ millions). FY2017 Total value of PP&E $947, Total value of information assets $1,032. FY2019 Total value of PP&E $1,088, Total value of information assets $1,082. FY2020 Total value of PP&E $1,109, Total value of information assets $1,239. FY2022 Total value of PP&E $1,223, Total value of information assets $1,213. FY2024 Total value of PP&E $1,088, Total value of information assets $1,239]

The value of PML is higher for information assets than for PP&E. Organizations estimate the average PML resulting from the theft or destruction of information assets at approximately $1,155 million, according to Figure 2. This assumes the normal functioning of passive protective cybersecurity solutions such as perimeter controls, data loss prevention tools, data encryption, identity and access management systems and more.

In contrast, the value of the largest loss that could result from damage or total destruction of PP&E is, on average, approximately $846 million. This also assumes the normal functioning of passive protective features such as firewalls, nonflammable materials, proper functioning of active suppression systems, fire sprinklers, raised flooring and more.
