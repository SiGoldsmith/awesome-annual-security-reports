Risky actions, real\-world threats 
and user resilience in an age of 
human\-centric cybersecurity

INTRODUCTION

Imagine a successful cyberattack against your organization. 
What does it look like? Maybe it involves a fiendishly clever 
piece of social engineering—a convincing lure that catches the 
recipient off guard. Or maybe it would take a smart technical 
exploit to get past your defenses. But in reality, threat actors 
don’t always have to try that hard. 

Often, the easiest way to breach security is to exploit the human factor. 
People are a key part of any good defense, but they can also be the most 
vulnerable. They may make mistakes, fall for scams or simply ignore 
security best practices. According to this year’s State of the Phish survey, 
71% of working adults admitted to taking a risky action, such as reusing 
or sharing a password, clicking on links from unknown senders, or giving 
credentials to an untrustworthy source. And 96% of them did so knowing 
that they were taking a risk. 

When obliged to choose between convenience and security, users pick the 
former almost every time. So, what can organizations do to change this? In 
this report we’ll take a closer look at how attitudes towards security manifest 
in real\-world behavior, and how threat actors are finding new ways to take 
advantage of our preference for speed and expedience. We’ll also examine 
the current state of security awareness initiatives, as well as benchmarking 
the resilience of people and organizations against attack. 

The foundation of this report is a survey of 7,500 end users and 1,050 security 
professionals, conducted across 15 countries. It also includes Proofpoint 
data derived from our products and threat research, as well as findings 
from 183 million simulated phishing messages sent by our customers over 
a 12\-month period and more than 24 million emails reported by our customers’ 
end users over the same period.

Security Behaviors and Attitudes 

Even the best technical defenses can be undermined if users don’t 
do the basics, such as avoiding suspicious links, verifying the 
sender’s identity and setting a strong password and keeping it to 
themselves. However, many users fail to follow these simple rules, 
putting themselves and their organizations at risk. 

End\-user behavior and attitudes 

According to our survey, 71% of users said they took a risky action and almost all 
of them—96%—did so knowingly. Among that group, 73% said they’d taken two 
or more risky actions. And more than a third of the risks they took were rated by 
those users as either “extremely risky” or “very risky.”

2024 STATE OF THE PHISH \\ REPORTUsers took risky actions for a variety of reasons: convenience, time saving and 
urgency being the most common answers. But a small cohort of 2\.5% took risky 
actions purely out of curiosity. Either way, the message is clear: people aren’t 
taking risky actions because they lack security awareness. Often, users know 
what they are doing when they take risks and are quite willing to gamble with 
organizational security.

Nobody knows this better than the world’s cybercriminals. They understand 
that people can be exploited, either through negligence, obliviousness or—in 
rare instances—malice. Social engineering is a part of almost every email threat 
analyzed by our researchers. And 58% of users who took a risky action said 
they engaged in behavior that would put them at risk of basic social engineering 
tactics, such as clicking on unknown links, responding to unfamiliar senders 
and sharing credentials with untrustworthy sources. These actions can lead to 
ransomware infection, malware, data breach or financial loss. 

7

2024 STATE OF THE PHISH \\ REPORT 
 
 
One of the reasons users take these risks is a lack of consensus about 
accountability and responsibility. Only 41% of users said they know that they 
bear responsibility for cybersecurity at their workplace. About 7% claimed that 
they aren’t responsible at all, while the majority (52%) weren’t sure.

Security Professionals

This contrasts with the view among security professionals, 85% of whom say 
that most employees know they are responsible for security. This gap between 
perception and reality suggests that there is a need for clearer communication 
about shared responsibility, rather than just more training on security best 
practices and policies.

The professional view 
Security professionals understandably have a different perspective 
on security risks to end users. They are more aware of the threat 
landscape and the consequences of a breach. And they have 
a more nuanced understanding of the challenges that go into 
securing complex and dynamic environments. They also have the 
unenviable task of finding ways to balance the need for security 
with the need for unhindered productivity and efficiency. 

According to our survey of security professionals, they rate users with access 
to business\-critical data as the biggest security risk (63%)—a group that is 
inevitably hard to manage, as much of that access is necessary. But click\-happy 
users and those who don’t complete security awareness training are close behind 
in joint second place (56% each). These categories of user were all considered 
significantly more risky than executives/VIPs (34%), despite the latter group often 
having broad access to valuable data.

Unfortunately, our survey reveals significant overlap between the riskiest 
behaviors identified by security professionals and the most common 
risky actions taken by end users. Reusing passwords, using work devices 
for personal activities and accessing inappropriate websites are among 
behaviors considered the most unsafe; all of them appeared in the top 
actions taken by users.

This overlap suggests that users may be taking some of these actions because 
they are unaware of just how risky they are considered by security teams.

2024 STATE OF THE PHISH \\ REPORTSecurity Awareness Trends 

While training alone isn’t enough to change unsafe behavior, 
teams that lack basic security awareness tools and knowledge 
are still much more likely to fall prey to cybercriminals. But 
as new social engineering lures and techniques appear on 
the threat landscape, awareness programs must be agile and 
broad\-based to remain relevant. 

Current state of security awareness 

First some positive news: 99% of respondents said they have a security awareness 
program of some sort up and running. But while the basics may already be in 
place, many are struggling to drive real behavioral change. A possible reason for 
this is that only 53% say they train everyone in the organization (down from 56% 
last year). This means that some users may be left out of the loop or may receive 
inadequate or outdated training.

Another challenge is the coverage and relevance of training topics. Security 
professionals agree that remote work, password hygiene and internet safety 
are critical, but less than a third of security awareness programs cover all these 
topics. The top training topics cited by respondents were malware, Wi\-Fi security, 
ransomware and email phishing, which are all important, but not sufficient 
to address the full spectrum of risks. And as we’ll see later when we examine 
the latest cybercriminal tactics and techniques, emerging threats can quickly 
become commonplace, taking unprepared users by surprise. 

10

2024 STATE OF THE PHISH \\ REPORT41% from 28% 

The percentage of organizations 

that trained specific roles jumped 

year over year

On the positive side, the survey shows some signs of improvement and innovation 
in security awareness tactics. Year over year, training of specific roles and 
departments has risen significantly (41% from 28%), indicating a more tailored and 
targeted approach. Time allocated to user education has also increased year over 
year, with more respondents dedicating over three hours per year to awareness 
training. Overall, the average amount of time dedicated to awareness training has 
increased for the first time in three years.

The types of tactics being used are evolving, too, with a 23% increase in the use 
of contests and prizes to gamify and incentivize attention. This change can help 
increase user engagement and motivation, while also creating a positive and fun 
learning environment. Computer\-based training remains the most common format 
(45%), but other methods such as simulated USB drops, videos, posters and 
newsletters are also being used.

However, only 34% of respondents say they perform simulated phishing attacks, 
despite the high volume of malicious email seen in the threat landscape. This 
suggests that there is still room for improvement in the composition of most 
security awareness training syllabuses.

11

2024 STATE OF THE PHISH \\ REPORTAreas for improvement 
Security is not only a technical issue, but also a cultural and 
organizational one. It requires the collaboration and commitment of all 
stakeholders, from security professionals to end users. However, there 
is often a gap between what security professionals think is effective 
and what end users say would motivate them to prioritize security

According to our survey, security professionals believe that more training, 
tighter controls, closer business alignment, better rewards and stronger 
championing of security initiatives would all be effective in improving security. 
However, fewer than a third of organizations reward positive user behaviors 
or champion security initiatives. These are important ways to recognize 
and reinforce good security practices, and to ensure that all employees are 
invested in creating a security\-aware culture.

In contrast, users overwhelmingly say that they want security to be made easier. 
They want processes to be more user\-friendly, convenient and transparent, and 
they want to have more communication and feedback from security experts. Users 
overwhelmingly agree (94%) that improving ease of use would motivate them to 
be more attentive to security. These disparities between security team actions and 
user motivations clearly demonstrate the need for open communication between 
security teams and end users.

In keeping with trends we’ve observed over the past few years, punishing unwanted 
behavior was considered the least effective approach by security professionals. 
Fortunately, it was also the least implemented. Punishment can have negative 
effects, such as creating fear, resentment and distrust, and reducing motivation and 
morale. It can also discourage users from reporting incidents or seeking help, which 
can seriously increase the risk of security breaches. Punishment was also the least 
motivating response among end users, though 71% still agreed that this would be 
an incentive for them. This suggests that some users may be willing to comply with 
security rules to avoid negative consequences, though it is unlikely that compelled 
participation will lead to enduring behavior change.

13

2024 STATE OF THE PHISH \\ REPORTThe Threat Landscape 

Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field as cybercriminals 
devise new and sophisticated ways to attack people and breach 
organizations. Users who take risks, such as clicking on suspicious 
links, opening unknown attachments or using weak passwords, 
face an increasing variety of real\-world threats from attackers.

Threat prevalence 

Some of the most common forms of attack reported by survey participants were 
phishing, business email compromise (BEC) and ransomware. While each of 
these techniques is distinct, security teams will often encounter them as individual 
components of an extended attack chain, with phishing leading to ransomware, 
or a supply chain attack leading to BEC.

However, these aren’t the only threats that users and organizations need to be 
aware of. According to our own data, many novel attack types are becoming 
increasingly prominent. 

14

2024 STATE OF THE PHISH \\ REPORTGrowing threats: 
TOAD, MFA\-Bypass, QR codes and generative AI 

In telephone\-oriented attack delivery (TOAD), the malicious message 
often appears to be completely benign, containing nothing more than 
a phone number and some erroneous information. It isn’t until the 
unsuspecting victim calls the listed number for help that the attack 
chain is activated. Cybercriminal call centers are operating around 
the world, guiding victims into granting remote access, revealing 
sensitive information and credentials, or even infecting themselves 
with malware. Our data reveals that an average of 10 million TOAD 
messages are sent every month. 

Another increasingly popular attack method involves using advanced techniques 
to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA), which is now a standard part of 
corporate cybersecurity. These attacks typically use proxy servers to intercept MFA 
tokens, allowing attackers to circumvent the additional layer of security provided by 
one\-time codes and biometrics. Several off\-the\-shelf phish kits now include MFA 
bypass functionality, allowing even relatively unsophisticated attackers to benefit. 
We see around 1 million phishing threats using the popular EvilProxy framework 
every month. This is of particular concern, as 89% of security professionals still 
consider MFA to be a silver bullet for protection against account takeover, with 84% 
of respondents saying their organizations use MFA to prevent account takeover.

And within the paradigm of traditional phishing, attackers are finding new ways to 
embed malicious content. In recent months we’ve seen an increase in the use of 
QR codes as an alternative to links or attachments. This technique is particularly 
dangerous, as it both attempts to evade automated detection while presenting 
users with a familiar format in a context they may not have seen before. It is also 
impossible to tell just by looking if a QR code leads to a phishing site or malware 
download. Unfamiliar users scanning a QR code may not even be aware that 
they’ve engaged with a piece of malicious content until it’s too late. 

15

2024 STATE OF THE PHISH \\ REPORTIt’s also worth noting that even the least common type of attack—USB drop—
was still reported by 60% of respondents. This shows that cybercriminals are 
willing to try any tactic, old or new, if they think it will give them a chance to exploit 
an unsuspecting victim. 

Despite the growing prominence and sophistication of these threats, many 
organizations are not adequately prepared or trained to deal with them. Only 23% 
of organizations train their users on how to recognize and prevent TOAD attacks, 
and only 23% educate their users on generative AI safety. 

Generative AI is a technology that can create realistic and convincing content—
such as images, videos or text—based on a given prompt or data input. This 
technology promises to enhance social engineering for all messaging\-based 
attacks, as attackers can use it to improve the quality of their lure, particularly 
when targeting other languages. Moreover, generative AI also poses a risk of 
data loss, as there is currently little transparency over what happens to data 
that is uploaded to services such as ChatGPT and Google Bard.

BEC attacks benefit from AI 

BEC attacks also continue to pose a serious threat, especially in non\-English\-
speaking countries. Fewer organizations reported BEC attempts globally, 
but attacks continue to grow in prevalence among countries such as Japan 
(35% year\-over\-year increase), Korea (31% jump), and UAE (29% jump). These 
countries may have previously seen fewer BEC attacks due to language barriers, 
cultural differences or lack of visibility. But there is now a likely link between BEC 
and generative AI, as attackers can use the latter to create more convincing and 
personalized emails in multiple languages. Our own data shows an average of 
66 million targeted BEC attacks every month. 

Microsoft remains most\-abused brand

Brand abuse is a favorite tactic for phishing and malware delivery, as attackers 
exploit the trust and familiarity that users have with certain brands. More than 
68 million messages were associated with Microsoft products and brand in 2023, 
making it the most abused brand by cybercriminals. Adobe and DHL rounded 
out the top three, but at fewer than 10 million messages each.

Ransomware still a major concern 

The percentage of organizations that faced a ransomware attack rose 5 percentage 
points to 69%. Almost 60% of organizations reported four or more separate 
ransomware incidents in a year, indicating that ransomware is still a persistent 
and lucrative form of attack.

One of the ways that organizations try to mitigate the risk and impact of cyberattacks 
is by purchasing cyber insurance, which covers the costs and damages associated 
with a cybersecurity incident. Among those that had experienced a ransomware 
incident, 96% now have cyber insurance. Most insurers (91%) helped with ransom 
payments, up from 82% the year before. However, globally, the rate of payment to 
ransomware attackers has declined from 64% to 54%.

declined, with the number who regained access after a single payment seeing the 
largest decline. This may be one explanation for the drop in payments. Another 
possible reason is that organizations are becoming more aware of the drawbacks 
and risks of paying ransoms, such as encouraging more attacks, funding criminal 
activities or receiving corrupted or incomplete data.

incidence of successful phishing attacks has declined, some of the negative 
consequences have soared. Year on year, we saw a 144% increase in reports 
of financial penalties, such as regulatory fines, and a 50% increase in reports of 
reputational damage due to phishing incidents.

The threat landscape is constantly evolving, as cybercriminals employ new 
tactics and techniques in their quest to gain an advantage. This is why it’s 
key to equip people with the knowledge they need to identify and resist 
attacks; after all, as sophisticated as these techniques are becoming, people 
remain their primary target. Most organizations say they use real\-world threat 
intelligence to shape their security awareness program, however there are 
some major disparities. For example, 73% of organizations experienced a BEC 
attack, but only 29% train users specifically on BEC threats. Similarly, only 23% 
of organizations provide training on TOAD attacks, despite their ubiquity. The 
threat landscape moves pretty fast; if you don’t stop and update your program 
once in a while you could miss something.

19

2024 STATE OF THE PHISH \\ REPORTOrganizational Benchmarks 

One of the ways that organizations can measure and improve 
their cybersecurity awareness and resilience is by conducting 
phishing simulations. Proofpoint phishing simulations mimic 
real\-world phishing scenarios and assess how users respond 
to them. Our customers conducted 183 million phishing 
simulations over a 12\-month period. Of these, link\-based tests 
were the most common, accounting for 59% of all simulations, 
followed by data\-entry tests (30%) and attachment\-based tests 
(10%). However, attachment\-based tests had the highest failure 
rate overall, at 17%. Failure rates for all types of simulations 
were within 1 percentage point of last year’s results.

We also analyzed failure rates by industry and found some interesting patterns. 
The finance industry saw the most improvement, with failure rates decreasing 
by 7 percentage points, from 16% in 2022 to 9% in 2023\. On the other hand, the 
agriculture and construction industries both saw their failure rates increase by 
3 percentage points from last year. Although this increase is relatively small, it 
may point to an underlying issue with security approaches in these industries.

2024 STATE OF THE PHISH \\ REPORTAnother factor influencing the success or failure of phishing simulations is the 
content and design of the test phishing emails. Templates are designed to mimic 
real\-world threats; accordingly, our customers featured Microsoft in 7 of the top 
10 phishing simulation templates, matching the data about abuse of its brand 
and products shared in the previous section. The highest failure rate among 
these templates was for a OneDrive deactivation email, which had a failure rate of 
10%. This email claimed that the user’s OneDrive account would be deactivated 
unless they clicked on a link and verified their identity. A lure like this is designed 
to trigger feelings of loss aversion and urgency—provoking the strong emotional 
response that is often at the core of effective social engineering.

Overall, the reporting rates for simulated phishing increased slightly to 18\.3%, from 
17% in 2022\. This means that slightly more users reported the phishing emails 
they received to their IT or security team, rather than ignoring or deleting them. 
Reporting rates are an important indicator of user awareness and engagement, as 
they show that users can recognize and flag suspicious messages.

2024 STATE OF THE PHISH \\ REPORTOverall failure rates for simulated phishing dropped to 9\.3%, from 10% in 2022\. 
This means that fewer users clicked on links, entered their credentials on fake 
websites or opened attachments. Failure rates are an important indicator of 
user vulnerability and risk, as they show how likely users are to fall for a real 
phishing attack. 

Based on these reporting and failure rates, we calculate a Resilience Factor 
for each organization. The Resilience Factor is a metric that compares how 
many users reported simulated phishing emails versus how many users fell 
for them. (It’s calculated as the average reporting rate divided by the average 
failure rate.) A higher Resilience Factor means that the organization has more 
users who report phishing emails than users who fail them, and vice versa. 
The average Resilience Factor increased to 2\.0 in 2023, from 1\.7 in 2022\. 
This number has been creeping up over the past three years, starting at 1\.5 
in 2021, indicating that organizations are becoming more resilient to phishing 
attacks as their users become more aware and proactive.

Not every reported email is, in fact, malicious. So we also benchmark real\-world 
reporting accuracy for customers who use our PhishAlarm reporting button. 
By this measure, the education, technology and legal sectors ranked best, 
with tech improving significantly from the year before. Still, more than half of 
reported emails were false positives; in some sectors, than number was close 
to 80%. Without an automated way to verify all those reported emails as true 
threats, it adds up to hours upon hours of needless work by security teams.

This shows that while the variety of phishing and malware attacks are increasing, 
people empowered with the right knowledge and right skills can proactively 
help keep organizations safe. User\-reported data is a valuable source of threat 
intelligence that security teams can use to better understand their adversaries, 
and to boost security education with real\-world examples. And the data from 
these user reports also feeds back into our threat detections, raising the tide for 
all boats.

2024 STATE OF THE PHISH \\ REPORTConclusion 

A security awareness program should be an essential component 
of any organization’s security strategy, but by itself it isn’t enough. 
Our data shows that 96% of people who took a risky action knew 
that what they were doing might be risky, so it seems that key 
information is getting through. However, knowing what to do and 
doing it are two different things. The challenge is now not just 
awareness, but behavior change. 

Users say they want security to be made easier for them, and they’re right to 
want that. But in those instances where processes can’t be made any easier 
and a choice remains between convenience and security, users still need to be 
convinced to choose correctly. 

So how can organizations lead this behavior change? 

Use threat intelligence to inform your behavior change program 

This will help users to understand the nature, scope and impact of the threats they 
face, and will help security teams tailor their program and messaging accordingly. 
To use threat intelligence effectively, organizations should: 

• Work collaboratively across the organization to understand user, department
and organizational goals, and then implement security controls that protect
the organization without getting in the way. Security should be aligned with
business objectives and user needs and should not be an afterthought or create
unnecessary barriers or operational burdens.

• Use internal data to define the top three risky behaviors that you want to change.
Internal data, such as simulated phishing assessment, user feedback or incident
reports, can provide valuable insights into the most common mistakes and risky
actions. By focusing on the top three risky behaviors, organizations can prioritize
their efforts and resources, and measure their progress and impact more easily.

27

2024 STATE OF THE PHISH \\ REPORTReduce security friction 

Complex or drawn\-out security processes can lead to user frustration, 
dissatisfaction and even resistance, potentially undermining the security culture 
of the organization. 

• Track where security controls create bottlenecks and work to alleviate them.
Anything that slows down system performance, interrupts user workflows or
requires multiple steps should be a candidate for review. These bottlenecks
can reduce productivity and efficiency and make users more likely to bypass
security controls altogether. Using the latest technology can help create a
light\-touch environment that minimizes disruption. For example, data loss
prevention (DLP) solutions can help by monitoring authorized senders and
recipients without getting in the way.

• Ease of use and automation should be prioritized, coupled with best\-in\-class
security education, threat prevention, detection and response technology.
By applying these principles and taking an integrated multilayered platform
approach, organizations can not only better defend against the constantly
changing threat landscape, but also reduce the cognitive load and effort users
have to expend to follow security rules.

Go beyond training 

Build a strong security culture with better communication and engagement. A 
strong security culture will positively influence how users approach and handle 
security issues and foster a sense of responsibility. 

• Implement a behavior change program tailored to user and business needs.

A behavior change program is a systematic and structured approach to
changing user behavior and habits. Find ways to positively reward users who
avoid risky actions and proactively help keep the organization safe, such as
reporting suspicious email or activity.

• Advocates or champions can help reduce the number of users who don’t know
if security is their responsibility. By promoting best practices and providing
peer support and guidance, advocates or champions can foster trust, increase
engagement, and help create a positive and collaborative security culture.
