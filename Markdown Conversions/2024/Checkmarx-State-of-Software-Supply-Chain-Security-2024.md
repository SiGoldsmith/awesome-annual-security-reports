2024 State of 
Software Supply Chain Security 
High-profile attacks affecting thousands of organizations 
have prompted stakeholders, ranging from national 
governments to corporate boards, to take a close look at 
the risk residing in the software supply chain. Attacks are 
frequent and malicious actors are weaponizing the open 
source components that make up a large percentage 
of applications.  
Beyond SBOM: What’s Next?
While awareness is important, it is what organizations 
decide to do that will make the difference in managing 
software supply chain risk. To understand the current state 
of software supply chain security (SSCS) we surveyed 900 
AppSec professionals in US, Europe and APAC based 
organizations across a wide range of industries.
The findings show an increased sense of awareness 
with more than half of respondents acknowledging 
that SSCS is a top or significant area of focus. How-
ever, only 7% have already purchased and imple-
mented an SSCS-specific product.
Thanks to US Executive Order 14028, SBOMs have 
emerged as a common starting point for the SSCS journey. 
However, more than half of the organizations that request 
SBOMs from third parties say they are not using 
them effectively.
If SBOMs are the start, where should organizations 
focus next? Right now, there’s no clear or strong 
consensus. Most companies are doing something, but 
few are succeeding.

As a result, organizations are
increasingly prioritizing SSCS 

## Key Findings
Every organization has been 
victim of a software supply 
chain attack
SSCS is a major area 
of concern
100% of respondents said they were 
aware of a software supply chain attack 
against their organization  at some point. Of 
these, 18% said they were attacked within the 
last year and 63% within two years.
With a significant percentage of their 
applications being open source, 75% of 
respondents said they were either very 
concerned (39%) or concerned (36%) 
about software supply chain security.
57% of respondents said that SSCS was 
a top or significant area of focus vs. other 
areas of security. 85% reported that they 
were actively using, purchasing, or planning 
to use a solution.
With much of the recent focus on SSCS being 
on vulnerabilities or malicious code in open 
source software, respondents estimated that, 
on average, about 56% of their applications 
contained open source software. 
However, doing SSCS 
well remains a challenge
Respondents reported big gaps between 
deploying a solution and using it effectively. 
50% said they already request SBOMs 
from their software vendors, but less than 
half of those reported confidence that they 
knew how to use SBOMs effectively if needed.

## Everybody’s Talking About SSCS
The first step towards fixing a problem is knowing it exists, 
and there’s no question that awareness around SSCS has 
soared in recent years. The 2020 SolarWinds attack was 
a wake-up call demonstarting how a single breach in one 
organization could  compromise thousands of customers 
and partners. 
SolarWinds may have been an early high-profile incident, 
but SSCS attacks haven’t slowed down. In December 2023 
alone, Checkmarx researchers exposed several major 
SSCS attacks.
These involved North Korean and Russian threat groups 
exploiting critical vulnerabilities, poisoning open source 
and private packages, and stealing cryptocurrency from 
Ledger Connect Kit users’ wallets after compromising 
a former employee’s npmjs account and releasing 
compromised versions.   
These attacks have guaranteed that SSCS stays top of 
mind. Everyone we surveyed had some level of knowledge 
around SSCS (Figure 1), and most are trying to act on it. 
The urgency to act also comes from experience. as 
18% of respondents report that they have experienced 
a SSCS attack in the past year, while 63% experienced 
one in the past two years.
These figures result from the cycle of zero-day exploit 
publications. As soon as an exploit is published, attackers 
update their attack scripts and start scanning public web 
applications to see what’s vulnerable.  
As a result, if your applications are exploitable, you will 
be attacked. This is causing natural concern that SSCS 
is not as effective as it should be (Figure 2).

With awareness comes the realization that SSCS is also 
strategic. Various factors are prompting organizations 
to seek SSCS solutions, including board directives, 
compliance requirements, and competitive pressures 
(Figure 3).  
The most common reason for searching for SSCS 
solutions is “investigating additional risks beyond what 
we consider today”.

There’s clearly a strong drive to address SSCS, however 
most organizations don’t know where to start.
Many organizations have a good foundation for building an 
SSCS program—even if they don’t know it—because they 
are using, or plan to use, software composition analysis 
(SCA) tools to identify open source vulnerabilities and 
license risks
Open source and third-party risk management is critical 
to controlling application security risk due to the 
proliferation of open source software (OSS) in application 
development. Open source software is used in more than 
56% of applications on average, according to surveyed 
organizations.  
Attackers have weaponized open source libraries by 
injecting malicious code into frequently used packages 
that are subsequently built into applications.
SCA vendors have responded to this threat by adding new 
checks and protections, such as: 
Checkmarx scans millions of OSS packages every 
month and has detected more than 200,000 malicious 
packages to date. A robust SCA solution, featuring what 
was described above, is a good start to an SSCS program.

source libraries

## SBOMs: Stuck on the Starting Block?
If SCA represents the (often unknown) start to SSCS, the 
first conscious effort is typically focused on the Software 
Bill of Materials (SBOMs). 
SBOMs are the headline feature and most tangible 
element of Executive Order 14028. They should 
contain an accurate list of all open source software 
ingredients found in a software-based product, creating 
transparency and visibility so users of the product can 
act if a vulnerability emerges in a product they are using. 
At least, that’s the theory.
SBOMs are only mandatory for vendors selling software 
products to the US federal government, but the 
government’s enormous buying power has created a 
seismic shift that means they have become a de facto 
standard. As a result, for many organizations today SBOMs 
and SSCS are one and the same.
Like all standards, however, their value depends on how 
they are applied. Evidence suggests that there is a lot of 
room for improvement in how SBOMs are operationalized 
to support SSCS.

Looking at how AppSec professionals allocate SSCS 
resources shows why this might be the case. The majority 
are allocating the most resources to the left of the SDLC, 
in the design and development stage (Figure 5). 
This makes sense when we consider that decisions 
about open source use are made—and the SBOM itself 
is created—at this stage. But this is only half of the story. 
SBOMs are designed to come into their own when a zero-
day vulnerability is released.
That’s when the organization needs to know where all 
its SBOMs are and how to interrogate them to discover 
whether the vulnerable library or version is in their 
application. This sits firmly in the “maintain” stage of the 
SDLC. More focus on this stage would strengthen the 
effectiveness of SBOMs and ensure they are playing 
the right role in SSCS, rather than becoming a tick-box 
compliance exercise.

## Beyond SBOMs: Building an Interdisciplinary SSCS Program
SCA and SBOMs are common entry points to SSCS, but 
we know that organizations are ready to put a lot of effort 
into building it out further, so where’s a good place to start?
For the 50% that are not using SBOMs effectively, fixing 
that issue is the first order of business. But we can’t 
place all our trust in SBOMs alone; they are part of the 
SSCS program, but not the whole of it. An SBOM lists the 
ingredients of an application, but they don’t give insight into 
the process by which it was built, and they don’t account for 
issues such as vulnerabilities in the component distribution 
system (see box).
In application development, the method is as important as 
the ingredients; they both contribute to the integrity of the 
application, and weaknesses in development processes 
and AppSec workflows can be just as problematic as 
vulnerabilities in the components used.
This means that there is a range of different SSCS tools 
and techniques that can be applied to different stages 
of the SDLC. It also means that SSCS, like application 
security, is a shared responsibility. An interdisciplinary 
approach is needed.
> “In the case of the Ledger Connect Kit attack, the primary 
issue was not with the components themselves but with the 
compromised distribution process due to an account takeover. 
The attacker published malicious versions of the package 
through a legitimate channel, which would not necessarily be 
flagged by an SBOM. Since the SBOM would list components 
as usual, it wouldn’t identify the malicious code introduced by 
the attacker in the compromised versions.
> “So, while SBOMs are vital for component transparency, 
they must be complemented with fast, proactive scanning 
mechanisms that can detect unauthorized changes or 
malicious activities in real-time, beyond just component 
listing.”

## Allocating SSCS Responsibilities
When looking at some of the tools that contribute to SSCS, 
we can see that although many organizations are using 
tools in different areas, few are succeeding across the 
board (Figure 6).

Where AppSec teams come into their own is in working 
with development teams to specify, set up, and support 
adoption of tools such as SCA to identify vulnerabilities 
and malicious code in open source software, IaC security 
to identify misconfigured resources, and tools to detect 
secrets leakage.
Some of these approaches sit logically with particular 
teams. Establishing artifact repositories for trusted 
content and requesting SBOMs for third-party software, 
for example, are practical actions for developers to 
take. However, developers won’t necessarily prioritize 
these actions if they are not operating in a culture 
of SSCS responsibility that is led and promoted by 
AppSec managers. 
Activities such as governing access to software 
development environments or CI/CD tools are shared 
between developers and IT departments.

Who has the primary responsibility for SSCS in your organization?
Our research shows that no single department has full 
responsibility for SSCS (Figure 7), and we’d argue that is just 
how it should be. It needs to be a shared, interdisciplinary 
process with good awareness among all stakeholders. 
Where organizations have a security champion, they can 
play a bridging role to get different stakeholders across 
security and development aligned.

## Get Moving: The Next Steps in Your SSCS Journey
We’ve established that SSCS is a multifaceted, 
collaborative undertaking. It’s a blend of technology 
and process, requiring action from development and 
security teams. It requires collaboration within a culture 
of security awareness. That said, someone must take 
the lead and ensure that the SSCS program is adopted 
by all the stakeholders involved. In that sense, AppSec 
professionals (drawing support from security champions) 
are best positioned to drive awareness of SSCS with 
development teams. 
There is a lot of ambition to tackle SSCS right now, so if 
your organization is ready, how can you get started?
The interdisciplinary nature of SSCS means there are 
several steps you can take concurrently across different 
areas, so the first step is to assess what tools and 
processes you currently have in place and whether they 
are being used effectively. Once you have your baseline, 
you can build on it to cover gaps and establish visibility. 
Just like with SBOMs, unlocking the value of AppSec 
tools depends on operationalizing and managing them 
effectively. This is a perennial struggle for organizations 
that typically have too many tools and a program that has 
grown organically. 
Tacking SSCS considerations onto it is unwieldy and 
can lead to low adoption and low effectiveness—as 
organizations have already reported.
The AppSec market has matured significantly in recent 
years, meaning organizations can now consolidate multiple 
siloed point solutions into integrated platforms that deliver 
clear visibility over the organization’s application security 
posture. Engage with vendors to see how their tools have 
evolved, but make sure you interrogate the vendor’s 
roadmap to ensure that the platform will evolve with 
your needs.

## Evolving AppSec To Support SSCS
11
2024 State of Software Supply Chain Security |  p.
Check whether the SCA tool can identify 
malicious code inserted into OSS, not just 
vulnerabilities. If you can expand an existing 
tool and remediation process to cover more 
threats, you avoid introducing extra burden on 
your teams. And if you’re choosing your first tool, 
you want to know that it detects open source 
weaponization as well as vulnerabilities.
Expand existing SCA coverage 
Don’t be tempted to buy a standalone tool for 
SBOM generation—it could quickly be relegated 
to shelfware. SBOM generation should be part 
of your SCA tool, and you should be generating 
an SBOM with every version of software you 
produce. As mentioned earlier, SBOMs have 
no value if not used correctly, so ensure they 
are properly catalogued and stored, with a 
documented process for how to use them when 
a zero-day happens.
Integrate SBOMs  into SCA

## Build on Your SCA Investment
Tackling OSS risk with SCA is the logical place to start 
your SSCS journey. Whether you are evaluating new SCA 
tools, or already working with a provider, you should look 
to do the following:
Consolidating AppSec capabilities such as 
SAST and SCA on a single platform allows you 
to correlate findings from different tools, which 
delivers an exponential improvement in visibility 
and actionability. It makes management easier, 
allowing you to manage and triage vulnerabilities 
in a single location and integrate more easily with 
developer workflow. 
Explore a platform approach
SSCS should cover the full software development 
lifecycle. When choosing an AppSec platform 
look for features that support security on the right 
side of the SDLC, such as container security and 
IaC security.
Look right
Implementing and refining software supply chain security 
will be a key activity for companies for the foreseeable 
future. The regulatory environment is increasingly 
focused on supply chains; EO 14028 now joined by NIS2 
in Europe, with stringent penalties for non-compliance. 
Even organizations that aren’t directly in the scope of these 
regulations will find they are affected if they want to sell to 
companies that are. 
Every company is part of someone’s supply chain. As such, 
organizations need to start building a comprehensive 
SSCS program, to better position themselves to compete 
and thrive in the future business environment.

## Methodology
To get more insight into current trends in software supply 
chain security, we commissioned a survey of 900 CISOs 
and application security professionals to shed some light 
on their key challenges and priorities. 
 
The survey was conducted online by Global Surveyz 
Research, an independent survey company. Respondents 
included a mix of CISOs, Deputy CISOs, VPs, Directors, and 
application security managers from companies in North 
America, W. Europe, and APAC with an annual revenue 
of $750M+, across a variety of industries, including: 
Banking & Finance, Insurance, Software, Technology, 
Engineering, Manufacturing, Industrial, and the Public 
Sector. The respondents were recruited through a global 
B2B research panel and invited via email to complete the 
survey. Answers to most of the nonnumerical questions 
were randomized to prevent order bias in the answers.
