# 2024 Mobile Security Index Report

## Who should read this report?
We produced the Verizon Mobile Security Index (MSI) to help security professionals, such as chief information security officers (CISOs), assess their organization’s mobile security environment and calibrate their defenses. This report is also relevant to anybody involved in the specification, procurement or management of IT devices and services.

## About this report
In April 2024, we commissioned an independent market research company to survey 600 people responsible for security strategy, policy and management. We also worked with several leaders in mobile device security: Akamai, Allot, CISCO, Fortinet, Ivanti, Jamf and Lookout. These contributors provided additional information, including incident and usage data.

We’d like to thank all our contributors for helping us to present a more complete picture of the threats that affect mobile devices and the work that is being done to mitigate these threats. This report wouldn’t be possible without them.

For more information on our methodology, see page 45.

## About the cover
The depiction of a cell tower on the cover reflects mobile device security issues in critical infrastructure sectors that were seen in this year’s MSI survey responses. Critical infrastructure industries supply the essentials of daily life to millions, including power, water, communications and transportation. In parallel, there are heightened risks from threat actors targeting organizations in these industries, along with an expanding attack surface from increasing Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile device use. Enhancing mobile device security serves to reduce financial and operational risks for organizations in all industries. In critical infrastructure, it has even more profound implications.

# Introduction—critical infrastructure on the radar
The first iPhone was released in 2007. Mobile devices have evolved dramatically and are now embedded into the daily lives of billions of people around the globe. What’s more, the already healthy use of mobile devices by organizations and their employees shot into the stratosphere during the COVID-19 pandemic, when remote work suddenly became the new normal and kitchens and living rooms were instantly transformed into remote offices.

This 2024 Verizon Mobile Security Index report has some familiar themes—such as the persistence of remote and hybrid work—while also revealing emerging mobile security considerations relating to critical infrastructure sectors, rising Internet of Things (IoT) deployments and artificial intelligence (AI) advances (from both attack and defense perspectives). We also found interesting differences between respondents’ perceptions and reality. Many assume that they had solid mobile security in place and that incident remediation would be quick and easy. But what those respondents actually report about attacks and breach frequency, along with negative breach impacts and worries, told a different story.

In our deeper dive into the critical infrastructure sector, we found that inadequate mobile security in any of the 16 defined critical infrastructure industries could have significant impacts on organizations in these industries and could have downstream impacts on the communities and individuals served.

From the survey data, one primary conclusion can be drawn: The growth of mobile computing and IoT is exponentially expanding the attack surface that needs protection, which in turn will require a matching focus on ensuring sufficient mobile security processes, policies and investments.

# Modern work, enabled by mobile
Even as some organizations pull workers back to the office, the remote or hybrid work paradigm is not likely to shift back to its prior state anytime soon. One reason is employees still strongly prefer the flexibility to work remotely at least some of the time, to work non-traditional hours, or to spend part of each workday in the office and part at home.

Employers on the whole still favor allowing employees to work remotely. Whether it’s working from home, the airport, a hotel or the local coffee shop, 92% of survey respondents say their organizations support some form of remote connectivity. This means that mobile devices are more deeply embedded into business-critical workflows than they were in the past.

* 92% of office-based employees value being able to work flexible hours.<sup>1</sup>
* 92% of organizations have employees who work from home at least some of the time.
* 80% of respondents agree mobile devices are critical to the smooth running of their organizations.
* 89% value working remotely at least part time.<sup>2</sup>
* 83% have employees who follow a hybrid work model.
* 55% of organizations have more users with more mobile devices than they did 12 months ago.
* 90% value being able to leave work during the day for personal reasons.<sup>3</sup>
* 80% have employees who travel for work.
* 46% of respondents agree that mobile devices have gone from a nice to have to a critical business tool.

Employer support for flexible and remote work means an expanding array of mobile devices of various types are connecting to enterprise networks on a regular basis. Increasingly, these devices are also being used to access sensitive information.

Because mobile devices now play an ever-expanding role in enterprise computing environments, these ecosystems are more complex, more diverse and more dynamic than ever before.

With hybrid and remote work becoming an established cornerstone of workplace policy and organizations depending more heavily on more different types of devices—in more locations—strategic investments in mobile security are no longer optional.

* 50% say mobile devices have greater access to sensitive information than a year ago.
* 62% of authentications to corporate networks come from mobile and non-traditional operating systems—a new high.<sup>4</sup>
* 86% agree that increased remote working has moved mobile security up their agenda.
* 86% agree that flexibility in where people work and what devices they use is key for attracting top talent.

# IoT—everything, everywhere, all at once
Mobile devices have been keeping businesses up and running for years. What’s changed recently is rapid growth in IoT deployments. These “things” give real-time visibility into the status of thousands of processes, from how machines are performing in factories to where vehicle fleets are traveling each day—even whether office buildings are set to the right temperature.

IoT adoption supports digital transformation across nearly every industry, making it possible to keep a watchful eye on the performance of key assets and enabling smarter, data-driven decisions.

## More IoT devices than ever
While reliance on mobile devices across all types of organizations has remained high, increasing only slightly over the last few years, IoT use has become nearly as ubiquitous. Nearly all organizations are using at least some IoT devices. What’s more, the majority of deployments are mature, full-scale implementations, not partial deployments or proofs-of-concept.

* 95% of survey respondents work for organizations that are using at least some IoT devices.
* 62% said they have mature, full-scale IoT deployments.

## Nearly infinite applications and use cases
IoT sensors and devices are being applied in an enormous and expanding array of use cases. They’re helping keep facilities secure and comfortable, hospital patients properly monitored and cared for, and supply chains flowing. Retailers use them to track store inventories, while others use IoT to monitor energy consumption. Another popular use case is predictive maintenance, which supports more reliable uptime in production operations, such as those in the manufacturing or energy sectors.

Organizations that use IoT devices are using them in more than three ways, on average.

**Figure 1:** Bar chart showing the percentage of organizations using IoT sensors or devices in various use cases. The use cases include: Other (18%), Supply chain & logistics optimization (17%), Environmental monitoring (25%), Smart city infrastructure (14%), Aerospace & Defense (26%), Media & Entertainment: Streaming TV, gaming, etc. (24%), Retail: Inventory, transactions, etc. (20%), Facilities maintenance & management (13%), Agriculture (8%), Oil & Gas (11%), Energy (27%), Automotive (21%), Patient monitoring or care (31%), Predictive maintenance (26%), Asset tracking (21%), Cold chain monitoring (11%), Cashless transactions (35%).

# IoT use is especially high in critical infrastructure sectors.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) describes critical infrastructure industries as providing a “backbone for society’s economy, security and health.”<sup>5</sup>

As such, these sectors are often a prime target of nation-state threat actors according to NIST, especially those focused on disrupting national security and public safety—because critical infrastructure operations are considered essential to national security.

Today, the widespread and growing use of IoT sensors and internet-connected devices can also expand cyber risks.

## The many uses of IoT in critical infrastructure
IoT devices and sensors today are used to monitor and control all types of assets, facilities and systems across a wide range of critical processes, increasing efficiency, security and resilience. IoT devices enable predictive maintenance across industrial environments and can detect an early-stage equipment failure before it results in downtime. They are also used to improve worker safety while decreasing the need for manual interventions.

IoT devices are also used to transform power supply networks into smart grids, turning metropolitan areas into smart cities, and making many types of public facilities safer and more comfortable. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg of IoT uses across critical infrastructure operations.

As a result, IoT adoption is expanding rapidly across nearly all critical infrastructure sectors.

* 96% of critical infrastructure organizations report some degree of IoT adoption.

## What is critical infrastructure?
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has designated 16 industries as critical infrastructure sectors, as follows:<sup>6</sup>

*   **Chemical**—enterprises that manufacture, store, use and transport chemicals, including potentially dangerous chemicals on which other sectors rely
*   **Commercial facilities**—sites where large crowds of people gather for shopping, business, entertainment or other activities
*   **Communications**—an interoperable network of satellites, wireless and wireline communications that provides an enabling function across all critical infrastructure sectors
*   **Critical manufacturing**—a subset of manufacturing with national significance, for which a successful attack could disrupt essential functions at a national level
*   **Dams**—critical water retention and control services, including hydroelectric power generation, municipal and industrial water supplies and agricultural irrigation
*   **Defense industrial base (DIB)**—the worldwide industrial complex that enables the research and development of military weapons systems, subsystems and components
*   **Emergency services**—resources that provide a range of prevention, preparedness, response and recovery services to help save lives and protect property and the environment
*   **Energy**—a multifaceted web of electricity, oil and natural gas resources and assets that also provides an enabling function across all critical infrastructure sectors
*   **Financial services**—the large global firms, nationwide and community banks, and credit unions that make it possible for consumers to deposit and invest funds, make payments, access credit and liquidity, and transfer financial risks
*   **Food and agriculture**—farms and restaurants, as well as food manufacturing, processing and storage facilities
*   **Government facilities**—a wide variety of buildings in the U.S. and abroad, many of which are open to the public that are owned or leased by federal, state, local and/or tribal governments
*   **Healthcare and public health**—focuses on population health and provides the response and recovery actions needed after large-scale hazards such as terrorism, infectious disease and natural disasters
*   **Information technology**—virtual and distributed functions that produce and deliver hardware, software, systems and services that help enable internet connectivity
*   **Nuclear reactors, materials and waste**—the nuclear power plants, research and test reactors, fuel cycle facilities, and waste management systems that help make up America’s extensive civilian nuclear infrastructure
*   **Transportation systems**—the modes such as aviation, trucking, maritime, rail, pipelines, postal/shipping services and mass transit that move people and goods across the country and overseas
*   **Water and wastewater**—the systems that provide safe drinking water and wastewater treatment services

<sup>6</sup> Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Critical Infrastructure Sectors.

Across all critical infrastructure sectors, respondents from energy utilities and Public Sector organizations report the most IoT projects in production.

**Figure 2:** Bar chart showing the percentage of organizations using IoT devices in various stages of deployment. The stages include: None of the above, Full-scale deployments, Partial deployments, Proofs-of-concept/pilots. The organizations include: Professional services, Retail and hospitality, Public Sector, Manufacturing, Healthcare, Financial services, Energy and utilities.

* 61% of critical infrastructure respondents use IoT devices to monitor the physical security of buildings and other properties, including video surveillance.
* 52% of critical infrastructure respondents use IoT devices to enable services such as digital signage, or to support consumer offerings such as wearables or in-vehicle services.
* 52% of critical infrastructure respondents use IoT devices to support efficiency by monitoring equipment or productivity.

These projects deliver value across an array of use cases, including physical security, environmental monitoring, location tracking and telehealth, among others.

# IoT security risks: Amplified in critical infrastructure sectors
IoT devices often have weak security and network connectivity. This makes their existence an expansion of the attack surface. This exposure is particularly concerning for critical infrastructure organizations, which are already attractive targets for some of the most sophisticated and best-resourced threat actors in the world.

IoT devices are still not subject to asset management or security monitoring in all organizations. And IoT devices tend to monitor legacy equipment in operational technology (OT) environments that may lack modern security features—a common reality in critical infrastructure industries.

## IoT vulnerabilities
Many IoT security vulnerabilities exist from the time of the device’s manufacture. Many come with weak default passwords, and changing them often isn’t intuitive. Some devices have credentials embedded in firmware, making them impossible to change. Others may not use authentication at all. And because IoT devices are designed to use little power to reduce costs and extend battery life, their processing capabilities are extremely limited. This limitation means they can’t run anti-malware programs or encrypt data shared across enterprise networks.

Network connectivity dominates IoT security challenges. Many devices are designed to connect automatically to the nearest Wi-Fi or local area network (LAN), potentially turning each device into an easy and attractive entry point for attackers looking for a stepping stone to wider networks.

At the same time, it can be difficult to secure communications between IoT devices and cloud apps. And it’s also often hard to deliver and install security updates to devices in the field.

A lack of industrywide security standards for IoT devices and their communication protocols increases security risks, as does having many devices installed in remote locations where they may be vulnerable to physical tampering.

## Critical infrastructure on the radar
IoT adoption is widespread in critical infrastructure sectors, where nearly all respondents report that they have at least some IoT devices in use.

More than half of respondents in critical infrastructure sectors report that they had experienced significant security incidents involving mobile or IoT devices. By “significant security incidents,” we mean incidents resulting in data loss or system downtime.

* 96% of critical infrastructure organizations use IoT devices.
* 53% of critical infrastructure respondents have experienced significant mobile or IoT device-related security incidents leading to data loss or system downtime.
* 48% of critical infrastructure respondents have experienced a major impact due to a security compromise of an IoT device.

Respondents in critical infrastructure organizations are aware of the severity of the risks they face. Most understand the consequences of a security breach, and they see the proliferation of mobile and IoT devices as a formidable security challenge. Nonetheless, rapid adoption continues.

## Top target: Energy and utilities
Critical infrastructure organizations see great benefit from the efficiencies and visibility that IoT brings. In the energy sector, sensors help workers detect transmission line and power station outages. Using data analytics, energy providers can better direct power across the grid to balance supply and demand, while helping to maximize the integration of renewable energy sources. Smart meters and thermostats are increasingly coming online in homes and businesses, providing data that utility companies now use to improve services.

It’s no surprise IoT adoption is close to universal in the energy and utility sectors. But it’s critical for these organizations to develop smart risk management strategies, since threat actors have increasingly demonstrated eagerness to target them. Look no further than the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, the Saudi Aramco drone strike, or the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines to appreciate the vast geopolitical consequences of such activities.

## Another prime target: Public Sector
The Public Sector also faces significant mobile and IoT-related security risks. According to the 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report, Public Administration is a top target for organized crime, along with state-affiliated threat actors (together responsible for 96% of breaches caused by external actors in which the actor type was known, n=305).<sup>7</sup> Thirty percent of breaches in this sector (when known) were espionage motivated.<sup>8</sup>

* 87% of critical infrastructure respondents believe a security breach involving mobile and IoT devices would have a substantial impact on their business.
* 86% of critical infrastructure respondents agree that security risks associated with mobile and IoT devices have escalated over the past year.
* 90% of energy and utilities respondents agree that managing the nation’s critical infrastructure makes them a prime target for cybercriminals.
* 70% of Public Sector respondents report that their organizations experienced a security incident involving a mobile or IoT device.
* 44% of critical infrastructure respondents identify “integration of mobile and IoT services” as a daunting security challenge.

# All sectors perceive increased mobile and IoT risk
Since we launched this report seven years ago, we’ve seen the percentage of companies that suffered a mobile compromise trend steadily upward, from less than 30% in 2018 to more than half (53%) today. Some of this increase is related to the expanding attack surface. As mobile and IoT devices are embedded into all types of workflows, the sheer number of devices and apps that businesses rely on snowballs (as do the risks).

At the same time, alongside device numbers, awareness of mobile-specific security risks has also grown. Many people once thought that mobile devices were inherently more secure than desktop or laptop computers. Not anymore. A large majority of respondents (85%) now recognize that mobile device threats are on the rise, and more than half of those surveyed have experienced security incidents firsthand.

* 85% of respondents say risks from mobile device threats have increased in the past year.
* 64% believe they are at significant or extreme risk from mobile device threats.
* 51% have experienced mobile app-related incidents from factors such as malware or unpatched vulnerabilities.

**Figure 3:** Pie chart showing the perceived mobile device security risk. 27% of respondents indicated that the risk has increased significantly, 58% indicated that the risk has increased, 11% indicated that the risk has not changed, and a small percentage indicated that the risk has decreased or decreased significantly.

## Awareness vs. real-world risks
For business users and consumers, 2023 was a record-breaking year for mobile threats. More zero-day vulnerabilities were discovered in iOS than ever before. The risky data collection policies used by popular apps such as TikTok and PinDuoDuo were on public display, while 75% of organizations experienced mobile phishing attempts targeting their employees.<sup>9</sup>

In 2023, almost every iOS update that users were asked to install on their smartphones involved a security vulnerability.<sup>13</sup>

More than 260 iOS Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) were published in 2023. Because so many mobile device operating systems aren’t updated as often as they should be, the data and personal information stored on or accessible through them remain susceptible to exploits for extended periods of time. And the number of attacks that exploited vulnerabilities as the critical path to initiate a breach nearly tripled (a 180% increase) in 2023 compared to the prior year.<sup>14</sup> Some of this growth is due to enormously successful widespread campaigns, such as the Cl0p ransomware gang’s exploitation of the MOVEit file transfer tool, which ultimately impacted millions of victims.<sup>15</sup>

* 33% of mobile phishing attacks against technology company employees in 2023 were successful.<sup>10</sup>
* 27% of mobile phishing attacks against the financial sector succeeded.<sup>11</sup>
* 21% of mobile phishing attacks targeting media and communications companies succeeded.<sup>12</sup>

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends baselining the following core technical capabilities:<sup>17</sup>

*   Device identification
*   Device configuration
*   Data protection
*   Logical access to interfaces
*   Software updates
*   Cybersecurity state awareness

NIST also recommends setting standards for non-technical aspects of IoT projects, including:<sup>18</sup>

*   Documentation
*   Responding to queries
*   Information sharing
*   Education and awareness

* 87% of respondents believe a security breach could severely impact the business’s operations.
* 39% have defined IoT standards.
* 37% centrally coordinate IoT projects.

## Mobile and IoT security lags behind usage.
Our ongoing reliance on mobile devices and rapid increase in IoT use generates opportunities for attackers to take advantage of key vulnerabilities, including as-yet-undiscovered zero-day attacks.

The vast majority of respondents (93%) express concern about mobile cybersecurity risks. Nonetheless, a minority (39%) have defined organizationwide IoT standards, and even fewer (37%) say their organizations centrally coordinate IoT projects.

Defining and adhering to cross-organizational standards is crucial to helping ensure IoT devices and sensors can keep up with evolving security and regulatory requirements. With enormous variability in device capabilities, use cases and risks, it’s important to set technical and non-technical standards for each IoT project across every business unit.

## Mobile phishing
> Data is the currency of modern enterprises. Establishing a strong data security strategy is not only a critical defense measure, but also a strategic business enabler.
>
> In years past, organizations had dedicated private data centers, housing multiple servers, network equipment and storage devices. These setups not only presented scalability issues, but required continuous hardware and software upgrades to accommodate rising data needs. If not well maintained, this infrastructure is also highly susceptible to malware and vulnerability-based attacks.
>
> Today, a majority of corporate data resides in the cloud across an increasing number of software-as-a-service (SaaS) and private apps. While this infrastructure is better maintained, making network bugs less of a concern, critical corporate data is also more widely distributed. This distribution presents other challenges, such as the risk of system misconfigurations, as sensitive data flows across an expanding set of apps.
>
> With more corporate data residing in the cloud, we’re seeing a shift away from traditional malware and vulnerability attacks. Because cloud infrastructure is better maintained, the return on investment for traditional exploits has diminished. In response, threat actors have changed their Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), to focus on leveraging social engineering, targeting a user’s mobile phone to steal credentials and impersonate users. With credentials in hand, they have immediate access to critical corporate infrastructure and sensitive data. We refer to this change in TTP strategy as the modern kill chain.
>
> To illustrate, consider recent high-profile attacks: MGM Resorts, Caesars Entertainment and Twilio. In each instance, the threat actor group known as Scattered Spider used the phishing kit Oktapus to social engineer via mobile devices. In another example, the Lookout Threat Intel team discovered a similar phishing kit, CryptoChameleon that has been used by what was likely a different group of threat actors to target the FCC, Coinbase, Google, Microsoft and other organizations.
>
> If a phishing attack is successful and a threat actor is able to get login credentials, the subsequent steps in the modern kill chain move rapidly. With direct access to an organization’s cloud infrastructure, the attack dwell time has gone from months to minutes. This also brings severe repercussions for individuals, who are at risk of identity theft, along with the organizations that are required to safeguard sensitive data. Defending against rapid modern attacks requires organizations to have clear visibility and automated response capabilities, both at the mobile endpoint and across their software as a service (SaaS) and private applications.

* 25% of mobile users tapped on at least one phishing link every quarter in 2023.<sup>19</sup>

# Breach risks and impacts are high, especially in critical infrastructure.
Mobile security risks are real—and expanding. All types of organizations are adding mobile and IoT devices into their daily operational processes, without extending robust protections across all endpoints. As a result, the attack surface is expanding. Again, critical infrastructure is at heightened risk overall, from increased IoT use to legacy systems and equipment to nation-state targeting.

## Mobile incidents and consequences
Not only are mobile compromises trending up, but the consequences of breach incidents can be profound. Widespread bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies have led to corporate, sensitive or regulated data being stored on or passing through mobile devices. And because mobile devices are so easy to carry, they’re also easy to steal. If a mobile device has high-value data stored on it, a breach can result in the immediate loss or theft of that data, especially if the device’s lock screen is disabled or it doesn’t have remote-deletion capabilities.

It’s especially worrisome that attackers who compromise a mobile device frequently use the infected device to gain access to company networks. This can result in large-scale data exfiltration, the spread of ransomware, customer and employee privacy violations and costly operational downtime.

* 25% of organizations have at least one mobile device user on staff who has disabled their lock screen feature, even though only 3% of all devices have the lock screen disabled.<sup>20</sup>
* 53% of respondents experienced an organizational security incident involving a mobile or IoT device that resulted in data loss or downtime.
* 47% report that such compromises had major impacts on their organizations.

<sup>20</sup> Jamf, Security 360: Annual Trends Report, 2024.

## The potentially high cost of breaches to critical infrastructure
Consequences of a mobile-related breach can be especially devastating for organizations in critical infrastructure sectors. Mobile—and especially IoT—devices are embedded in mission-critical processes and workflows. A breach or failure can disrupt operations and has the potential to impact human health and safety.

Critical infrastructure organizations tend to face higher remediation costs and downstream losses when a breach occurs. Among respondents in critical infrastructure organizations that had suffered a compromise:

* 85% of Public Sector respondents agree that a security breach of their organization could endanger lives, especially if critical or emergency services go down.
* 82% of manufacturing respondents agree that a security compromise could disrupt their company’s supply chain, bringing serious financial implications.
* 92% of healthcare respondents agree that the highly confidential nature of patient data makes their organization a prime target for cybercriminals.
* Nearly half (40%) admit they experienced damage to their reputations and loss of business.
* More than a quarter (28%) report that addressing the incident required expensive remediation.

## Mobile attack objectives and how to address them
> According to research from Jamf, the majority of malicious actors targeting mobile devices are trying to achieve one of the six goals outlined below.<sup>21</sup> That’s why it’s a good idea to follow best practices adapted for mobile from standards such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks to help protect your organization.

<sup>21</sup> Jamf, Security 360: Annual Trends Report, 2024.

*   **Gain access to confidential business data.** Attackers are frequently motivated by financial gains or competitive advantages; theft of intellectual property is frequently cited as a top motivator for developing malware.
*   **Spy on users without their knowledge or consent.** Threat actors have been observed taking advantage of the always-on, always-with-us nature of mobile devices to listen to conversations, intercept SMS messages and track physical movements through GPS.
*   **Bypass internal security protections.** Modern operating systems like iOS have built-in protections to restrict what can run on mobile devices. Changes to Apple’s controlled distribution model via regulation like the EU’s Digital Markets Act is reducing the efficacy of those once controlled walls built to protect the mobile device.
*   **Obtain private data without authorization.** Researchers at Jamf have seen malicious apps circumventing Apple’s Transparency, Consent and Controls (TCC) as part of the attack chain targeting Apple users, ultimately weakening built-in protections and making device compromise easier. Apple’s mobile devices have similar features in place to protect end user privacy that can also be tampered with as the attacker looks for the weak links in the chain.
*   **Run malicious code on devices.** Zero-click exploits are well-documented, but vendors are quick to patch vulnerabilities that are exposed to the remote attacker. The ultimate goal is usually for the attacker to gain a foothold on the device from which they can surveil, exfiltrate data or pivot to another asset.
*   **Pivot from an infected device to compromise networks.** Beyond data theft, privacy compromises and persistence objectives, it’s not uncommon for attackers to simply use a compromised (and trusted) mobile endpoint to move closer to the more valuable target within the organization.

# Shadow IT: A looming security challenge
Whose mobile device is that? Where did it come from? How did it get connected to our network? Is its operating system up to date? Does it meet compliance requirements? These questions are being asked by security professionals inside many organizations today. And as mobile and IoT devices continually connect to enterprise networks, many organizations face challenges in keeping track of them all.

## Out of the shadows
We define shadow IT as the use of hardware or software by a department or individual without the knowledge or oversight of the organization’s IT or security team. Shadow IT adoption takes place across all sectors. With so many organizations prioritizing agility and end-user experiences and too few building universal security policies across locations and device types, there’s fertile ground in many enterprises for shadow IT to grow, creating additional security risks.

Without oversight, shadow IT devices are at high risk of misconfiguration, having out-of-date or unpatched software such as apps and operating systems, or having insecure apps downloaded from an untrustworthy source. As a result, end-users are vulnerable to phishing, malware and other attacks.

Survey respondents indicate growing concerns about the risks unmanaged devices pose.

* 54% are very or quite worried about shadow IT.
* 87% of respondents are at least somewhat worried about shadow IT.

## BYOD risks
Companies that allowed employees to use their own devices at work peaked in 2021, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup>22</sup> Since then, BYOD adoption has stabilized, with a majority of companies either allowing or considering allowing personal device use for work-related tasks.

Securing employee-owned devices is often considerably more difficult than securing corporate devices, especially without a mobile device management (MDM) solution in place. In reality, adopting a BYOD policy means making a concession: It’s the same as saying that some shadow IT is okay. If employees are allowed to use their personal devices at work, everyone in the organization is entrusted with responsibilities that once belonged only to the IT department. Still, many organizations offer BYOD policies.

* 59% of respondents allow employees to access work email from their personal phones/devices.
* An additional 34% are considering doing so.

<sup>22</sup> Verizon, Mobile Security Index, 2022.

## Secure connectivity
It’s not just mobile device vulnerabilities that generate risks. Insecure connectivity makes it easier to steal data or compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information. For many organizations, the pressure’s on to allow remote workers to use public Wi-Fi, home Wi-Fi and cellular networks. Even those that don’t explicitly allow these types of connectivity often struggle to prevent it in real-world scenarios.

## Security tools and policy advantages
Research from Ivanti shows that today’s top employees prefer workplace policies that include flexible scheduling and hybrid work that allow them to work where and when they’re most productive.<sup>23</sup>

* 37% of employees in organizations that ban (or don’t have a policy on) the use of public Wi-Fi use it anyway.
* 45% of employees in organizations that ban (or don’t have a policy on) the use of home Wi-Fi use it anyway.
* 26% of employees in organizations that ban (or don’t have a policy on) the use of cellular networks or hotspots use them anyway.
* 41% would consider changing jobs to gain more flexibility at work.<sup>25</sup>
* 79% agree letting people work anywhere is the future of professional employment.<sup>26</sup>
* 80% of office-based workers highly value workplace flexibility, or find it something they can’t do without.<sup>24</sup>

To meet their employees’ rising expectations, companies provide support and solutions to enable them to work securely, regardless of their location. Organizations that have defined policies for allowing public or home Wi-Fi use or the use of cellular networks for work purposes have an edge here.

Nearly all respondents (99+%) indicate their organizations have implemented remote access security technologies. The most commonly used solutions in this category include:

*   Virtual private networks (VPNs)
*   Identity and access management (IAM) platforms
*   Cloud access security broker (CASB) tools
*   Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

In addition, more than two-thirds (66%) of respondents now apply centralized security standards across all projects involving mobile devices and more than half (58%)
