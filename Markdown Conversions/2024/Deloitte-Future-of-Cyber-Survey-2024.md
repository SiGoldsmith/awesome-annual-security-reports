## THE PROMISE OF CYBER
THE GLOBAL FUTURE OF CYBER SURVEY, 4TH EDITION

2
Getting a clearer view into the future of cyber is 
a constant undertaking, allowing us to not only 
stay ahead of emerging risks but to identify new 
possibilities for business value. 
In this, the 4th Edition of Deloitte’s Global Future 
of Cyber Survey, we get that clearer view. We see 
that the link between cybersecurity and business 
value is growing stronger—with cyber becoming 
increasingly integral to enabling tech-driven 
programs and driving business outcomes. We 
see also how the role of C-suite leaders, including 
the chief information security officer (CISO), is 
evolving as cyber considerations intensify across 
the enterprise.
We are excited to share key findings from the survey 
and invite you to explore them here. In the following 
pages, you’ll find a blend of data-driven insights plus 
observations based on Deloitte’s deep global cyber 
experience, as well as reflections provided directly 
by interview respondents. Take a look and, if you are 
interested in a deeper dive, we would love to hear 
from you. 
Happy reading,

The future of cyber is constantly evolving 
as organizations across the globe deal with 
ongoing business complexity and change, 
as well as a myriad of new threats and risks. 
Yet one thing remains constant: Cyber and 
business value are deeply intertwined, 
and cybersecurity stays central to how 
organizations in every industry consistently 
deliver the outcomes they desire.
That powerful connection between cybersecurity and 
business impact comes into sharp focus in Deloitte’s 
4th Edition of The Global Future of Cyber Survey—
which asked nearly 1,200 leaders in various industries 
worldwide to share their views on cyber threats, 
enterprise activities, and the future. The survey included 
C
-suite executives across the enterprise, as well as other 
senior leaders with responsibility for IT, security, risk, 
and the business.
Focusing on outcomes and resilience

## A NEW ERA OF TRANSFORMATIONAL CYBER STRATEGIES
5
VIEW FROM THE TOP
The focus on outcomes is growing stronger
In our previous report, the 3rd edition of the 
survey, Deloitte recognized the extent to which 
cyber was evolving into a distinct functional area 
of the business, transcending its traditional IT roots 
and becoming an essential part of the framework for 
delivering business outcomes.
In this 4th edition of the survey, we see that, in 
addition to cyber strategy being essential to unlocking 
greater business value, cybersecurity in practice 
has become increasingly integrated into technology 
transformation activities. We also see that the voice of 
cyber leadership—in particular, the CISO—has grown 
in importance, along with the emergence of a new 
cyber-savvy C
-suite. 
Despite the growing focus on cybersecurity, 
only about half (52%) of all respondents are very 
confident in the C-suite and board’s ability to 
adequately navigate cybersecurity. And specifically 
among C-suite respondents who are focused mainly 
on cybersecurity, only 34% are very confident—
suggesting that they have less confidence in their 
abilities than others do.
But when we look just at organizations that Deloitte 
has classified as having high cyber maturity, we see 
two important findings: Cybersecurity is recognized at 
senior levels, and there is a strong correlation between 
organizations’ cyber maturity and having greater 
confidence in adequately navigating cybersecurity. In 
fact, among high-cyber-maturity organizations, that 
confidence in the C
-suite and board grows to 82%—
compared to 52% and 39% for medium- and low-cyber-
maturity organizations, respectively.
The survey’s findings indicate that, on average, 86% of 
respondents are implementing actions to a moderate 
or large extent to increase cyber strategies and actions, 
embracing cyber as an essential component of the 
enterprise. And, on average, 85% of respondents 
expect to achieve their desired business outcomes to 
a moderate or large extent. While this underscores the 
critical role cyber plays in driving successful strategy 
implementation, not all organizations will realize those 
benefits equally. 
And the more cyber-mature the organization, the 
bigger the potential impact. The survey found that 
respondents in high-cyber-maturity organizations 
anticipate almost two times the positive business 
outcomes compared with their peers. How these high-
cyber-maturity organizations view cybersecurity—and 
how they are taking action—provides insights and 
a potential path for others to follow as they seek to 
increase their own cyber maturity.

VIEW FROM THE TOP
Cyber-mature organizations are more prepared and resilient
In this edition of the survey, Deloitte identified high-
cyber-maturity organizations based on several factors. 
As in the previous edition of the survey, we assessed 
their level of strategic cybersecurity planning and 
specific cybersecurity activities, and engagement 
in cybersecurity at the board level. Based on these 
factors, among the most cyber-mature organizations, 
there is a clear sign that cybersecurity’s influence in 
supporting and shaping technology-driven projects has 
grown by three percentage points. 
However, given the rapid advancement in artificial 
intelligence (AI) technology, global organizations have 
experienced more sophisticated attacks. At the same 
time, opportunities have emerged to invest in AI-
powered tools and cybersecurity solutions. Accordingly, 
we have updated the Deloitte cyber maturity index 
to include the extent to which respondents use AI 
capabilities within cybersecurity programs (see Cyber 
Maturity, page 25).
Among these high-cyber-maturity organizations, the 
CISO and other cybersecurity leaders are being called 
in as experts to help guide investments in cloud-driven 
business initiatives, AI-enabled activities, enterprise 
resource planning (ERP) modernization, and other 
digital transformation priorities. Put another way, 
cybersecurity is playing a large role in helping to secure 
funding for technology capabilities. The heightened 
focus on cybersecurity also means that the CISO is 
more involved in strategic conversations related to 
digital transformation.
While these high-cyber-maturity organizations are 
implementing foundational cyber actions—such as 
having a strategic and operational plan, cyber risk 
monitoring, and more—what is most notable is their 
ability to bounce back rapidly from cyberattacks. Being 
more cyber-mature does not make these organizations 
immune to threats. It makes them more resilient when 
they occur, to enable critical business continuity. 
As compared to overall survey respondents, high-
cyber-maturity organizations expect to achieve 
business outcomes by 27 percentage points more, on 
average, than global respondents overall. And they 
maintain those expectations despite reporting 11 or 
more cyber breaches in the past year (eight percentage 
points more than overall) and despite suffering negative 
consequences (on average seven percentage points 
more than overall). It may be that high-cyber-maturity 
organizations are identifying more cyber breaches—
and therefore reporting more—not necessarily 
experiencing more.

VIEW FROM THE TOP
The leaders of high-cyber-maturity organizations 
understand that being prepared to respond to and 
recover from the inevitable attack—to get their 
businesses back up and running quickly, and to serve 
their customers—is what matters most.
What are organizations hoping to prepare for (or 
avoid) as they become more resilient—and how has 
the picture changed? Compared with the previous 
edition of the survey, a loss of confidence in tech 
integrity (i.e., reliability, accuracy, and availability 
of systems and data) has risen to the top of the 
list as the number one negative consequence of 
cybersecurity incidents or breaches—becoming 
increasingly important as organizations accelerate 
their digital transformation journeys. 
Operational disruption, including supply chain or 
partner ecosystem disruption, remains high on 
the list, in the number two spot, underscoring the 
importance of business continuity across partners and 
infrastructure. However, there is also a notable shift, as 
this was the top concern in the previous edition of the 
survey. Reputational loss climbed up one place as the 
number three concern (Figure 1).
The steps organizations take today should focus 
on how cyber investments can optimize, preserve, 
protect, and create value for the organization. 
That includes laying a strong foundation for future 
growth through cyber practices that enable data 
security and integrity across digital products and 
infrastructure. That foundation also should incorporate 
the fundamentals of a responsive infrastructure and 
digital ecosystem—for enabling future growth and 
business resilience. This edition of the survey shows 
a marked trend toward cyber programs and CISOs 
gaining greater strategic influence across all these 
value streams through more integrated technology 
transformation strategies—especially among the most 
cyber-mature organizations.
An effective approach to cybersecurity should 
extend beyond the traditional focus on incident 
response. It should delve into the core of how 
businesses need to integrate cyber—risk, security, 
and trust—into their overall strategy. Adopting a 
holistic, business-oriented perspective allows you to 
bridge broader business objectives and operational 
needs. This approach ensures that cyber is not just 
a reactive measure but a proactive, integral part of 
the organization’s strategic business, technology, 
and operational framework. Moreover, Deloitte’s 
research illustrates that the most cyber-mature 
organizations in the market are gaining significant 
value through a similar business-oriented approach.

> Our threat surface is quickly increasing. 
As we connect our factories with new 
technologies, new risks emerge. As soon as 
we tie in a supplier’s robot who wants to call 
back to the manufacturer for maintenance 
or push a software package to an assembly 
line component, things gets much more 
complicated.”

## METHODOLOGY
8
Headquarters locations of the organizations we surveyed
Deloitte also conducted in-depth interviews with 
senior cyber decision-makers across various 
industries and geographies, to glean more detailed 
insights and to help validate our observations. Our 
approach covered every aspect relevant to the 
future of cyber, from strategy to tactics and culture 
to technology implementation.
At the core of this research, we focused our efforts 
on exploring how cybersecurity has changed 
since the last edition of our report while applying 
a forward-looking lens, to help bring the future of 
cyber into sharper focus. We also wanted to get a 
clearer view into the cyber savviness of the C-suite 
today. Throughout the survey, we have looked to 
unlock insights for better understanding the cyber-
related business value and impact organizations 
are experiencing, as well as the distinct actions that 
leading organizations are taking to increase value.
Deloitte designed the 4th Edition of The 
Global Future of Cyber Survey based on the 
complexity of today’s business and technology 
landscape, focusing on the needs of enterprise 
leaders who may recognize the importance of 
cybersecurity yet struggle to harness its value.
Deloitte based its research on a survey of nearly 
1,200 cyber decision-makers at the director level
or higher, including C-suite executives and their 
direct reports, covering a mix of business and
IT functions. The survey reflects data gathered 
across 43 countries and six industries, and is limited
to organizations with at least 1,000 employees
and US$500 million in annual revenue.
Behind the research

## HOW WE DEVELOPED THE INSIGHTS

KEY FINDINGS
The path to cyber maturity is becoming 
even clearer as we look toward the future 
of cyber. Organizations that travel along 
that path will integrate cybersecurity risk 
strategies, security practices, and trust-
building approaches into their business and 
technology transformation—enabled by a 
cyber-savvy C-suite and highly influential CISO. 
Those organizations can expect to see a bigger 
impact when it comes to measures of success, 
positioning their organizations to undertake 
transformation more effectively in a rapidly 
evolving digital landscape. 
As organizations take continuous steps toward 
becoming cyber mature, they can set themselves 
apart from their peers by prioritizing and building 
cybersecurity connections across their business and 
technology operations, and their leadership. Doing 
so will enable them to more successfully achieve the 
strategic outcomes that we saw being prioritized in the 
previous edition of the survey. 
In this report, we will explore high-level insights 
grounded in data from the survey, the cyber maturity 
index, and insights from global leaders, to show how 
and where high-performing organizations are standing 
out and to guide global cybersecurity professionals on 
how to become more mature in their cyber practices.

KEY FINDINGS
The foundational importance of cybersecurity 
is undeniable in today’s deeply interconnected 
digital environment. And organizations have 
no shortage of activities/actions and strategic 
levers they can pull to bolster their cyber 
readiness to enhance business value. 
Taking action is a first step, 
but not the only step
Most respondents are taking the need for 
cybersecurity action seriously, with 86% of them 
implementing specific activities/actions to a moderate 
or large extent to increase cybersecurity. This level of 
action suggests that organizations overwhelmingly 
understand the need for these activities and a robust 
cybersecurity program to implement them. It also 
suggests that they are keeping pace as the list of 
activities they need to stay on top of continues to grow.
These respondents are focusing on a variety of 
activities for managing cybersecurity, including 
but not limited to: mitigating risks, enhancing 
cybersecurity controls, improving incident response, 
increasing employee awareness, and adopting a 
strategic cybersecurity plan. 
When we project those activities through the lens of 
cyber maturity, we see that organizations with high 
cyber maturity undertake these actions to a greater 
extent compared to less cyber-mature organizations 
(Figure 2, see also Cyber Maturity, page 25). 

CYBERSECURITY ACTIVITIES AND THE CONNECTION TO MATURITY (FIGURE 2)

The overwhelming majority of organizations are 
also embracing a number of strategic cyber actions 
including: benchmarking and measurement, 
collaborating with trusted providers, participating 
in consortia for information sharing, and establishing 
governing bodies that comprise senior business 
and IT leaders to oversee cybersecurity capabilities

KEY FINDINGS
Eyeing bigger cybersecurity 
investments amid increasing threats
More than half of the global respondents surveyed 
(57%) anticipate increasing their budget for 
cybersecurity over the next 12 to 24 months. Fifty-
eight percent of respondents also indicated that they 
expect to begin integrating their cybersecurity spend 
with budgets for other programs, such as digital 
transformation initiatives, IT programs, and cloud 
investments. This level of investment and budget 
integration underscores the increasingly interwoven 
nature of cybersecurity activities across the business. 
It also emphasizes the reality that cyber funding is a 
zero-sum game, as cybersecurity is often overlooked 
during transformation projects, to save costs in a 
zero-sum environment. 
Continuously prioritizing and building cybersecurity 
connections across business and technology 
operations, as well as leadership, is crucial for 
organizations to differentiate themselves and achieve 
strategic outcomes successfully. A cyber-mature 
organization understands that cybersecurity is not 
just an IT issue but a business-critical imperative 
that requires integration across all functions and 
levels of the organization. By fostering such strong 
cybersecurity connections, organizations can 
enhance collaboration, information sharing, and 
decision-making related to cybersecurity. 
This approach enables leaders to make informed 
strategic decisions that align with business objectives 
and mitigate cyber risks effectively. Ultimately, 
organizations that prioritize cybersecurity and build 
strong cybersecurity connections—integrating cyber 
across enterprise functions and leadership roles—
can better protect their assets, reputation, and overall 
resilience in an increasingly digital world.

KEY FINDINGS
Attack realities are growing, including 
new threats and cyber risks related to 
Generative AI (GenAI) 
The expected increase in investments comes as 
organizations experience a growing and diverse mix 
of cyber threats. Similar to the previous edition of 
the survey, cyber criminals and terrorists make up 
the top threat actors. They were reported by 42% of 
respondents as the leading concern across a diverse 
set of threat actors, which included hacktivists (threat 
actors aiming to make a statement related to political 
or social causes), cyber criminals (perpetrating 
malicious activities for financial profit), and insiders 
(with personal grievances and gains at stake). 
As for the tools and techniques employed by 
cyberattackers, phishing, malware, and ransomware 
combined emerged as the top threat vector, reported 
by 34% of respondents. That level is down eight 
percentage points from the previous survey, coinciding 
with a significant jump in reported threats related to 
data loss—up from 14% in the previous survey to 28% 
in this survey. 
Meanwhile, 40% of respondents said they have 
publicly reported six to ten cybersecurity breaches 
in the past year—an increase of two percentage 
points compared to the previous survey. And it is 
no surprise that attacks continue to trend upwards. 
The attack surface available to threat actors is large 
and continues to grow. 
The survey also tracks how respondents are responding 
to new cyber risks arising from the emergence of GenAI. 
The analysis shows awareness of these risks is more 
pronounced among high-cyber-maturity organizations 
versus less-mature counterparts. Among the most 
cyber-mature organizations, these are the top four 
GenAI-related risks that respondents believe will impact 
their cybersecurity strategy: 
- Explainability in GenAI outputs (82%)
- GenAI algorithms introducing information 
integrity risks (81%) 
- Effectively developing controls related to 
GenAI and humans working together (81%) 
- Data poisoning (e.g., corrupting the training 
data set to influence GenAI outputs) (80%)
As more organizations automate their processes
and share their data with suppliers and other third 
parties, new vulnerabilities can emerge. These 
increasingly complex digital infrastructures and 
ecosystems introduce new opportunities for attack.

> Everything—and everyone is so interconnected, 
that the risk is magnifying. Think about our entire 
supply base. Think about all the levels of security 
capabilities across the whole spectrum of companies 
out there. We feel pretty good about what is 
happening on our campus and with our employees.

with our network has the same level of capability 
and capacity to deal with security and controls?”

KEY FINDINGS
Technology integrity is the top concern among 
respondents as expectations for the benefits 
to be gained from cyber programs grow 
Amid the persistent web of threats, organizations 
are experiencing a range of negative effects, 
including impacts across three domains—financial, 
operational, and brand (Figure 6). Overall, across 
all three of these domains combined, the top two 
concerns are loss of confidence in tech integrity 
and operational disruption (Figure 1, page 7). This 
continued focus underscores the importance of 
having strong cybersecurity programs that can 
maintain critical technologies and operations, and 
boost business resilience. 
Respondents are experiencing all negative 
consequences to a higher extent than in the 
previous edition of the report. On average, 56% 
experienced all these consequences to a moderate 
and large extent in the 3rd edition of the report, 
compared to 64% in the 4th edition. 
This increase points to two potential realities. First, 
organizations might be more comprehensively 
reporting the impact from cyberattacks, signaling 
increased awareness. Second, the attack surface 
and frequency has increased due to GenAI and 
other advanced technologies, which highlights the 
growing importance of cybersecurity in the future 
and provides a clear call to action for putting in place 
robust cybersecurity plans.
