Enhance Security Readiness

The cyber threat landscape is a volatile and ever\-changing arena where new 

threats constantly emerge and old ones evolve at a rapid pace. As a cybersecurity 

practitioner on the front lines, staying ahead of these threats 

is not just a goal, but a necessity.

Flashpoint’s Cyber Threat Intelligence Index: 2024 Midyear Edition presents 

critical data and trends surrounding both persistent and emerging cyber threats 

observed from January 1 to June 30, 2024\. Using this intelligence, organizations can 

identify areas of opportunity to fortify their defenses and 

set up teams for success in anticipating potential threats—helping them to better 

protect people and assets alike.

Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities continue to be a rising threat vector as 2024 unfolds, as witnessed in the headlines and 

reflected in Flashpoint’s data. So far this year, vulnerabilities have risen by 11% and the availability of 

publicly known exploits has increased by 6%. To mitigate the risk of exploitation, organizations must 

continue to harden exposure management programs that prevent unauthorized access and the installation 

of malicious software such as infostealers and ransomware.

Key Takeaways

Flashpoint aggregated and enriched 17,518 newly disclosed vulnerabilities in H1 2024\. 
936 of them were missed by CVE and NVD.

Over 45% of all vulnerabilities disclosed in H1 2024 are rated high to critical in CVSSv3\. In order to 
prioritize effectively, organizations will need to avoid a top\-down patching approach.

Vulnerability management teams can potentially reduce their critical vulnerability workloads up to 83% 
by focusing on remotely exploitable issues that have public exploits and a verifiable solution. However, 
given the current NVD slowdown, organizations will need a quality source of vulnerability intelligence 
for a comprehensive view.

Information\-Stealing Malware

Flashpoint has been observing a significant rise in the use of infostealer malware. It is simple, effective, 

easy to obtain, and inexpensive for threat actors to purchase. This has propelled infostealers to become an 

increasingly primary vector for ransomware and other high\-impact data breaches.

Groups

The United States remains the primary target for ransomware groups, followed by the United Kingdom 
and Canada. This sustained focus is driven by factors such as availability of high\-profile targets, the 
potential for lucrative ransom payments, and overall challenges in dismantling sophisticated ransomware 
operations.

The technology industry was the most targeted industry for ransomware, followed by manufacturing. 
Technology firms are high\-value targets because they provide critical infrastructure, while manufacturing 
companies combine access to important supply chain components with a tendency to rely on more 
outdated and vulnerable systems.

LockBit continues to be the most prolific ransomware group, claiming 428 victims in the first half of 2024\.

Insider threats encompass a spectrum from accidental data breaches to calculated infiltrations. 

Recognizing and mitigating insider threats demands a comprehensive source of threat intelligence that 

can monitor activity on the deep and dark web—in addition to illicit marketplaces and forums.

Key Takeaways

Flashpoint observed more than 8,497 unique instances of insider recruiting, advertising, or general 
discussions involving insider\-related threat activity across our chat collections.

The vast majority of insider threat activity came from individuals advertising their services to malicious 
actors. Most of this activity occurred in the telecom industry, where employees solicited to perform SIM 
swaps for threat actors.

The finance industry is seeing an increasing number of insider threats where insiders are offering their 
positions or expertise—helping threat actors bypass security measures or facilitating illegal transactions.

Foresight Informs Preparedness

The data in this report, collected from January 1 to June 30, 2024, offers a 

snapshot of the most critical threats as organizations head into the remaining 

months of the year. Staying ahead of threat actors requires more than just 

reacting to incidents as they occur and foresight is the key to preparedness.

Foresight is only actionable through comprehensive intelligence. As such, this 

midyear report serves as a catalyst for organizations to proactively assess their 

security posture, priorities, and opportunities for enhancement. By becoming 
aware of the trends, tactics, and targets of today’s cybercriminals, security 

teams can identify and address potential weaknesses in their defenses, 

anticipate potential threats, and empower themselves to proactively respond.

To better navigate the evolving cyber threat landscape, we encourage 

organizations to explore the Flashpoint 2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report 

for deeper insights and actionable strategies to safeguard critical assets.
