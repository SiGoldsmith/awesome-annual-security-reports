# Enhance Security Readiness

## Vulnerabilities

Flashpoint aggregated and enriched 17,518 newly disclosed vulnerabilities in H1 2024. 936 of them were missed by CVE and NVD.

Over 45% of all vulnerabilities disclosed in H1 2024 are rated high to critical in CVSSv3. In order to prioritize effectively, organizations will need to avoid a top-down patching approach.

Vulnerability management teams can potentially reduce their critical vulnerability workloads up to 83% by focusing on remotely exploitable issues that have public exploits and a verifiable solution. However, given the current NVD slowdown, organizations will need a quality source of vulnerability intelligence for a comprehensive view.

Vulnerabilities continue to be a rising threat vector as 2024 unfolds, as witnessed in the headlines and reflected in Flashpoint’s data. So far this year, vulnerabilities have risen by 11% and the availability of publicly known exploits has increased by 6%. To mitigate the risk of exploitation, organizations must continue to harden exposure management programs that prevent unauthorized access and the installation of malicious software such as infostealers and ransomware.

## Information-Stealing Malware

Information-stealing malware poses one of the most significant threats in 2024. Cybercriminals have used this malware globally, infecting more than 13 million devices and compromising over 53 million credentials. This stolen data fuels increasingly complex and damaging ransomware attacks.

Redline has been the most prolific infostealer, infecting over 3 million hosts and exfiltrating over 10 million stolen credentials.

In total, Flashpoint has collected over 456 million stolen or leaked credentials.

Flashpoint has been observing a significant rise in the use of infostealer malware. It is simple, effective, easy to obtain, and inexpensive for threat actors to purchase. This has propelled infostealers to become an increasingly primary vector for ransomware and other high-impact data breaches.

### Key Takeaways

## Ransomware

The United States remains the primary target for ransomware groups, followed by the United Kingdom and Canada. This sustained focus is driven by factors such as availability of high-profile targets, the potential for lucrative ransom payments, and overall challenges in dismantling sophisticated ransomware operations.

The technology industry was the most targeted industry for ransomware, followed by manufacturing. Technology firms are high-value targets because they provide critical infrastructure, while manufacturing companies combine access to important supply chain components with a tendency to rely on more outdated and vulnerable systems.

LockBit continues to be the most prolific ransomware group, claiming 428 victims in the first half of 2024.

Ransomware is a vital part of any organization’s risk landscape awareness. As threat actors and their tactics, tools, and procedures become more advanced, ransomware groups such as LockBit and Black Basta have become more aggressive in their endeavors.

## Insider Threat

Flashpoint observed more than 8,497 unique instances of insider recruiting, advertising, or general discussions involving insider-related threat activity across our chat collections.

The vast majority of insider threat activity came from individuals advertising their services to malicious actors. Most of this activity occurred in the telecom industry, where employees solicited to perform SIM swaps for threat actors.

The finance industry is seeing an increasing number of insider threats where insiders are offering their positions or expertise—helping threat actors bypass security measures or facilitating illegal transactions.

Insider threats encompass a spectrum from accidental data breaches to calculated infiltrations. Recognizing and mitigating insider threats demands a comprehensive source of threat intelligence that can monitor activity on the deep and dark web—in addition to illicit marketplaces and forums.

### Key Takeaways

*Image: A bar chart titled "Recruiting vs. Advertising Insiders" showing the number of posts related to recruiting and advertising insiders. The chart shows that there are more posts related to advertising than recruiting.*

*Image: A pie chart titled "Insider Posts by Industry" showing the percentage of insider posts related to different industries. The industries listed are: TECHNOLOGY, HEALTHCARE, OTHER, PUBLIC SECTOR, TELECOM, RETAIL, and FINANCE.*
