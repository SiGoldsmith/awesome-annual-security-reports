Reshaping cloud security begins with organizational transformation

## Introduction
In the first guide for CISOs, Google Cloud Office of the CISO (OCISO) distilled insights gained from our experience working with hundreds of customers trying to transform their businesses by moving their enterprises to the cloud. Nearly two years later, we’re here to provide an update on the journey and share additional lessons learned.

As we’ve helped more security teams make the move to the cloud, we’ve identified nuanced challenges that they face – namely those related to team structure, changing business operations, and establishing culture – that are critical to their success
In this guide, we’ve captured insights and recommended practices focused on the organizational and operational elements of digital transformation. As you read this guide, please refer to the appendix for deeper discussions on security teams before and after digital transformation and the relationship between organizational culture and transformation.

### What we’re seeing now
The journey through digital transformation and reinvention regularly involves challenges that many leaders and teams have not experienced or even thought of before. Determining which optimizations your organization’s structure needs to match your expanding technical capabilities can be daunting, no matter how well you plan.

Organizations are surprised when embracing certain elements of transformation particularly around teams, skills, and the jobs to be done in cloud. Perhaps none more so than those who have to change their organization and its structure. These changes are often necessary to realign teams to new goals – many of which have become shared between teams that may not have worked closely together before.

At the same time, the introduction of new technologies like cloud, and new ways of automating work, with infrastructure-as-code and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), drive new levels of work velocity which challenge historical decision-making processes and related forms of governance. Teams shift from securing individual systems to securing services and products that are “built into” the cloud at speeds never seen before.

### Digital transformation defined
Digital transformation uses modern digital technologies, including all types of public, private, and hybrid cloud platforms, to create or modify business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market dynamics.

Digital transformation spurs a new way of working and optimizing technology, processes, and organization toward accelerated business outcomes. Trying to predict what a transformed organization model will look like is challenging as there is no single “best practice.” What’s possible is to set goals on what business outcomes one seeks then model, orient, and adjust the organization model to achieve those outcomes at the highest velocity, balancing quality, cost, and risk along the way. What’s our answer when we get the question, “How should I organize my cloud security team alongside my on-premise security team?” We say: it depends. It depends on what the business outcomes an organization wants and how much change its willing to endure to get there.

So where do we start when we talk about transforming the cybersecurity organization within a company that’s historically delivered security to on-premise systems within a highly centralized function? Ideally, we think this conversation should start with defining security goals framed in business outcomes like capabilities, velocity, quality, cost, and risk. However, this type of goal framing rarely exists for the existing teams in the first place. We think goal setting is critical, but many organizations are faced with a different set of challenges that leaders should be aware of.

### Pre-transformation realities
*   **Working with the “day job”**: Many teams just getting started in transformation projects report struggling with managing legacy security processes, adopting new technologies like cloud, and all the while keeping up with emerging threats and servicing the existing needs of their organization. Adding more work to the already busy “day job” is a common, repeated term.
*   **Reducing toil**: What’s also difficult to understand in the early stages of transformation is believing that adoption of the cloud will result in less work and a more secure system. Yet, many teams are structured to deliver services around tools that secure on-premise systems and follow processes that have remained unchanged for years. Many processes and controls have taken years to put into place. Teams may remember the pain of putting them in and may not want to change, or worse, these processes have become a dangerous source of pride. Moving away from the toil often associated with securing on-premise systems can be challenging for unexpected reasons. We think security in the cloud is a better future that can be difficult to imagine without inspiration and intentional culture development.
*   **Building new skills**: Moving away from these processes can feel expensive and require learning they may not have time, interest, or motivation to invest in. Moving on to new platforms like cloud can challenge a teams’ existing skill sets, and, when paired without thoughtful or effective training, transformation initiatives can pause or stop as a result. Bringing in new team members with cloud skills is also challenge. Current estimates taken at the time of this paper indicate there being over 3.5 million unfilled job openings for cybersecurity professionals with 700,000 in the US alone.
*   **Driving to new organization models**: Many cybersecurity teams aren’t designed to provide “product” security, which is a style of delivering security over the course of its entire life cycle (development, delivery, production use, retirement). With so many products existing within an enterprise, trying to deliver product-specific security controls in an on-premise network full of various operating systems, applications, network designs, operational technologies, and others is infeasible. In the place of an application or product-specific security approach, security teams build and deliver horizontal security services, like vulnerability scanning, that can detect vulnerabilities in all kinds of infrastructure and applications. Once detected, teams struggle to assign vulnerability correction (for example, patching) activities to application teams to take action on them.

    Broadly, the activity of “find and assign” security problems to application teams creates slowness and if not well managed and governed, results in tremendous waste and worse security outcomes due to blurred accountabilities for who’s doing the fix.
*   **Product teams**: High-performance product teams have all the skills they need to deliver a secure application through development, deployment, production use and retirement. Product teams increasingly place the burden of detecting and fixing security problems before they happen on themselves. Product teams can deliver platform capabilities (like Identity and Access Management) that other product teams (like teams that build inventory or manufacturing systems) consume.

    In evolved organization models, cybersecurity teams might find themselves providing more coaching to product teams on how to increase their scope and improve their quality, governing (vs. driving) vulnerability mitigation, and providing consulting support around things like threat models.

A successful digital transformation requires a new approach and pushes teams to distribute responsibilities, not to centralized teams, but to more product-based teams. This way product teams own responsibility for the availability and security of the systems they build and operate.

Maintaining a “single organization” approach to how cybersecurity (or really any function) gets done can delay or even stop transformation initiatives from having the impact the organization’s leadership seeks. Indeed, failure to transform the organization becomes the most substantial blocker to adopting faster, more efficient, and increasingly more secure ways of work.

It’s important to note that every industry and company operates with its own dynamics and challenges. Keep in mind the insights provided here are intended to serve as a flexible guide meant to be adjusted, rather than as a prescriptive set of rules for a digital transformation journey.

### About Office of the CISO
Office of the CISO (OCISO) brings together senior security leaders and advisors who enable Google Cloud customers to securely adopt cloud technologies and transform their organizations.

We have the singular mission of supporting the secure digital transformation of governments, critical infrastructure, enterprises, and small businesses. We work directly with regulators and deeply within industries, spanning sectors such as financial services, retail, public sector, telecommunications, media, healthcare and life sciences, and digital-first enterprises. We are security leaders, CISOs, researchers, engineers, and practitioners who care deeply about securing customers, securing the cloud, and securing the planet.

As with anything we do at Google Cloud, we want and appreciate your input and feedback. The exchange of best practices and information are essential in navigating the evolving landscape of cybersecurity, and we are committed to fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing. We invite you to send us your feedback.

### About cloud transformation and DevOps
The key to creating faster, more efficient, and increasingly more secure organizations starts with the transformation of the organization itself. Many of the concepts covered in this paper are based on our collective experience working in cybersecurity engagements where we’ve supported organizations in their cloud transformation. Some of the research we use in this paper comes from our annual Accelerate State of DevOps Report.

Each year, these reports feature data gathered directly from tens of thousands of professionals working across every industry and in companies of varying sizes. Our Google Cloud DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) engagements and expert teams work with survey respondents to review, compile, and publish insights that help teams understand the capabilities that drive software delivery and operations performance. The program started in 2014 and was acquired by Google in 2018. As part of Google Cloud, we continue our research and help customers on their journeys of continuous improvement.

We encourage readers of this paper to explore our most up-to-date DORA research at [dora.dev](http://dora.dev).

### Mindshift: Security goes cloud first
Here’s something we know to be true: digital transformation isn't just about technology. It’s more about transforming the organization, its operations and its technology. Done correctly, digital transformation can change who does the work and how it gets done using automation, machine learning, and other technology available on the cloud.

You’ll find many opinions about how cybersecurity enables a successful digital transformation, but most observers are unaware of the complexity involved in effectively collaborating and sharing responsibilities, skills, tooling, and other capabilities with fast-moving product-based teams who own the full set of responsibilities – including cybersecurity – for the applications they build and run.

Unfortunately for many chief information security officers (CISOs) there’s no one “perfect” operational model that an organization can implement coupled with clear recommendations on which responsibility, skills, tools, and capabilities become shared and with whom. These shifts depend greatly on factors outside of the CISO’s control, including organizational risk appetite, budget, demand for the organization’s services, and regulatory perspectives, among other factors.

### Why it’s OOT, not TOO, in the cloud
Our first step in helping customers work through transition to the cloud and more modern ways to work starts with backing away from the belief that it’s the technology that’s transforming.

In the earliest days of cloud, organizations looking to transform did so by moving on-premises servers (or virtual machines) from their data centers “into the cloud.” The concept of server movement was straightforward: create a connection between a data center and a cloud services provider, make a copy of the on-premises server, upload the copy to the cloud, initialize copy to a running server, do some networking magic, and you were done. Start saving money by shutting the server down when you aren’t using it and voilà – Transformation!

Now, services could be acquired without complicated procurement or security processes to slow them down. Quickly, organizations deployed new mission-critical services, but without awareness into the longer term needs the organization would have for product support or who was now responsible for change control and ensuring uptime requirements were met. The speed was great, but questions about who was responsible for approving new systems or moving data to the cloud were sometimes answered following processes that had been stood up outside of establishing governance channels meant to stop proliferation of technical decisions that would result in future pain. In some cases, the rapid acquisition of cloud by early adopters led to challenges for security and other support teams who needed to support them.

We’ve studied the stories of success and caution and seen them play out time and again in the Fortune 500 and beyond. We believe organizations who rapidly transform using cloud – and do so securely – succeed by focusing on their initial priorities in this order:

*   Organization
*   Operations
*   Technology

We call this O-O-T or “OOT.” As we’ll explain, to avoid suboptimal outcomes, organizations must start with understanding their teams, their resources, locations, and constraining factors or conflicts, such as goals, incentive structures, and resource limitations, before approaching finalizing technology decisions.

### Choreographing change
Successful transformation starts with an understanding of the goals the organization has for velocity, quality, security, risk and capability of its operations. Strong leadership direction, with clear goals and measurements, is critical.

To put the transformation efforts into context, we suggest a four-stage framework. In Appendix C, we offer a deeper explanation of what these stages mean when applied organizing cybersecurity teams. We use these stages to pinpoint what their challenges are and what progress looks like. This can help everyone working in cybersecurity better anticipate and prepare for organization transformation.

### Organization transformation defined
The document includes two diagrams illustrating the stages of organization transformation.
*   **First Diagram:** Titled "How organizations think digital transformation goes", this diagram shows a smooth progression through four stages: Experimentation and Disintegration, Dissolution, Transformation, and Integration. Each stage is represented as a step in a linear sequence, suggesting a straightforward path.
*   **Second Diagram:** Titled "How organization transformation actually goes", this diagram also shows the same four stages, but the path between them is not linear. Instead, there are arrows going back and forth between the stages, indicating that progress is not always smooth and that organizations may need to revisit earlier stages as they experiment and optimize.

#### The four stages of organization transformation
*   **Stage 1: Experimentation and Disintegration**
    Teams are encouraged and enabled to experiment with new technology and will be able to find and demonstrate its value. Teams given autonomy to build without rules find ways to reinvent their work. The value and benefit of cloud is teased through these simple examples. Excitement about what’s now possible and what could be done on larger scales creates the need to disintegrate.
*   **Stage 2: Dissolution**
    Teams begin to sense that disintegration of the “old way” of doing work (without automation, following manual processes, according to traditional ways of organizing processes to do work) seem to inhibit the speed that’s possible using cloud. Team norms and structures begin to be challenged as organizations start to establish new ways of working, new shared goals and outcomes.
*   **Stage 3: Transformation**
    Now begins the stage of implementing new capabilities that change and eliminate steps or entire ways that work was done previously. This move entails significant investment in new technologies and systems. This stage can be a long and complex one, as organizations need to carefully plan and execute the transformation across entire functions, business units, divisions, and the company itself.
*   **Stage 4: Integration**
    Next comes the stage of integrating the new digital business model fully into how the organization's day-to-day operations run. Volumes of work go down as the use of automation and technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) become more rapidly deployed and improved. Organizations shift from building, to maintaining, and finally optimizing continuously.

### How security is organized during transformation
How can we apply this framework to cybersecurity teams? This guide was designed to help teams do exactly that. To be as inclusive as possible, we put forward a reasonably comprehensive list of cybersecurity teams and functions. No two organizations are the same, and we did not intentionally leave any groups out. If you have a question about how a specific role or function transforms, send us your feedback.

You might be surprised to see functions in this list that aren’t typically assigned explicit responsibilities for cybersecurity. We’ve included them to show you how functions and their related responsibilities change as the security transformation kicks in.

### How to use this guide
In Appendix A, we share explanations and outline how the cybersecurity responsibilities and functions transition over the four stages of transformation.

To use this cybersecurity transformation framework, security leaders should:
1.  Select a cross-functional group of individuals who are involved in planning or executing security responsibilities within your organization.
2.  Review the stage descriptions and list of key functions, noting which ones exist within your security organization today and which do not. Find out where responsibility for certain functions exists for each function listed.

    *Note: We expect this to be a difficult activity, as no organization will perfectly match our list of functions and responsibilities. Truly understanding who is responsible and accountable for what and which responsibilities are unclear or not assigned is an important first.*
3.  Read the descriptions provided for each function in Appendix A. Determine what stage of transformation each individual function is in. (Note: Gather evidence, data, or other facts to find the markers and support your determinations.)
4.  Share your stage selections with your team and each owner of a critical function that is currently outside of your team (or in early stages of forming). Ask:
    *   Do they think the list of functional security responsibilities is complete and accurate?
    *   Do they think the selections of each stage for each function makes sense?
    *   What would they change, add, remove, or modify to make this specific to your organization?
5.  Review the stage-to-stage descriptions in the appendix and reflect on how these functions are performed today in light of the organization’s current cloud and non-cloud usage.
6.  Identify a target state and select one for each function. Use the appendix to determine how to achieve that state. Ask yourself:
    *   Working backwards from the desired end state, what needs to change now to take my organization there?
    *   What’s our desired state look like?
    *   What organizational, operational, or cultural issues might get in my way?
    *   What processes, including ownership of those processes, must change to achieve the desired state?
    *   What technical barriers exist that we must overcome to achieve that desired end state?
    *   What decisions must get made, and by whom, to initiate and sustain the organization and operational changes needed?
    *   Which of these decisions are directly within your control or outside of your control (or even, outside of your company?)
7.  Take the results, socialize with your team, and select end states and target efforts (preferably, shared goals with functions that will be changing) to achieve desired results.

### Modern security organization models
The document includes a diagram illustrating the evolution of security team organizations through the four stages of transformation. The diagram shows the following:
*   **Left side:** Lists the four stages of transformation: Experimentation and Disintegration, Dissolution, Transformation, and Integration.
*   **Middle Section:** Lists various security functions (Security operations, Threat intelligence, Cloud security, Security architecture, Incident response, Data protection, Identity and access management, Product management, Application management and support, Software engineering, Infrastructure engineering, Enterprise risk function, Project management office, Privacy office, Compliance, Audit and advisory, Detection and response)
*   **Right side:**  Shows how these functions evolve into future security organization models: Infrastructure engineering and automation, Product teams, Site reliability engineering, Cloud strategy and governance, Integrated risk, compliance, audit, and Security engineering and automation.

You can follow the path through the four stages of organization transformation and see how cybersecurity team organizations evolve, integrate, and streamline into future post-transformation models for teams.

#### Post-transformation security team models
*   **Infrastructure engineering and automation**
    Infrastructure engineering and automation teams focus on discipline around design, build, and physical and virtual systems that support product infrastructure. These teams address all aspects of a product or workload, inclusive of security, availability, integrity, capacity, and recoverability of all infrastructure. This includes everything from the servers and storage systems that store data to the networks that connect them to the applications and software that run on them. Infrastructure engineering teams deploy infrastructure and policies using code and deployment automation.
*   **Security engineering and automation**
    The security engineering and automation team plays a vital role in helping organizations improve their security posture and reduce the risk of security incidents. The team works to implement increasingly more secure designs into cloud using code. They also help automate security tasks, freeing up security professionals to focus on more strategic work, and improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the organization's security operations. These teams often manage security products under a single charter for both on- and off-premises. Teams use intelligence to inform and prioritize efforts continuously.
*   **Detection and response**
    The detection and response (D&R) team includes security professionals responsible for detecting and responding to security incidents. The D&R team typically reports to the chief information security officer (CISO) or another senior security executive.

    Threat intelligence is a critical function that is close to and drives D&R activities. Threat intelligence (TI) functions can be separate from D&R teams or highly integrated. TI is not used only by D&R teams but across the full spectrum of security, risk, governance, and other increasingly data-driven functions.
*   **Product teams**
    A product delivery team is a cross-functional team of people responsible for delivering a software product to the customer. The team typically includes members from the product management, software delivery, engineering, design, quality assurance, and operations departments. Product teams in this model also own security features, security tool implementation into product workflows, and the implementation of security policies into products. Product teams can develop and deliver all sorts of products – like platform services (like IAM), traditional applications, and many other things.

    The end goal is a more streamlined organization when transformation is achieved. Here are profiles of newly integrated teams and the roles they take on.
*   **Integrated risk, compliance, audit**
    The cross-functional risk, compliance (including privacy), and audit teams (inclusive of disciplines like information security, privacy, and resilience) are responsible for working with first-line teams to understand and implement controls to mitigate risks. Internal teams audit the organization's practices to ensure they conform to organization policies and statements about risk while also performing other forms of advisory and audit work.

    Often mechanisms, such as risk appetites/tolerances, risk rating, and quantification, developed by these teams are used by product, infrastructure, application, and other teams to prioritize controls, vulnerabilities, incidents, and other work and send them into product and engineering teams to implement.

    Increasingly, these teams are using continuous monitoring and auditing approaches as well as threat intelligence to monitor risks and prioritize action.

    Internal audit teams also conduct audits and assessments using cloud-first services for large-scale data analysis or policy-as-code to evaluate the compliance posture of a workload.
*   **Cloud strategy and governance**
    Cloud strategy and governance steering is a cross-functional team responsible for approving and implementing the organization's cloud strategy via projects and products. The team typically includes members from the product, IT, business, risk, compliance and legal departments. These team members are usually stakeholders from both the technology and business organizations that are leading the transformation.
*   **Site reliability engineering**
    The site reliability engineering (SRE) team is a cross-functional arrangement of system experts responsible for the reliability, performance, availability, scalability, and operational security of a company's software systems. The team can include members from the engineering, operations, security, and DevOps disciplines. The mission of the SRE team is to protect, provide for, and guide the progress of software and systems development.

### Summary
Digital transformation initiatives are both exciting and challenging. While these efforts deliver new technologies, they present opportunities to examine and adjust organization structures and operating models.

They provide a chance to re-examine culture, shift focus to the needs of customers and users, acquire new skills and methods to deliver and manage technology, set shared goals, and distribute work in new ways to new teams.

## Appendix A
### Organization descriptions before transformation
#### Profiles of existing teams and their roles
*   **Security operations**
    Security operations is the practice of combining security and IT operations to improve collaboration and reduce risks. Security operations teams are responsible for monitoring, detecting, and responding to cyber threats. They also work to prevent security incidents by implementing and maintaining security control. Areas of focus:
    *   Monitor and detect threats – using a variety of tools and techniques to monitor an organization's networks, systems, and applications for signs of malicious activity, including monitoring for intrusions, unauthorized access, and data exfiltration.
    *   Respond to threats – working to respond quickly and effectively to mitigate risk when a threat is detected, involving isolating the affected system, investigating the incident, and addressing the vulnerability that was exploited.
    *   Detect vulnerabilities – working with security engineering and product teams to detect and respond to vulnerabilities in a cloud environment.
*   **Threat intelligence**
    Threat intelligence teams collect, curate, and analyze relevant threat data from various sources. They identify and track threat actors, their capabilities, and their targets to inform various teams on how to adjust the organization's defenses in response. The teams also share threat intelligence with other organizations to identify and mitigate the threat. Areas of focus:
    *   Collect and analyze threat data – collecting this data from a variety of sources, such as open source intelligence, social media, and dark web forums and then using this data to identify and track threat actors, their capabilities, and targets.
    *   Develop threat models – describing how threat actors may attack an organization, which in turn helps organizations to understand the threats they face and proactively adapt security controls.
    *   Share threat intelligence – working with other organizations to help them protect themselves by way of public reports, private briefings, or through threat intelligence sharing platforms.
*   **Cloud security**
    Cloud security is the practice of protecting data, applications, and infrastructure that is hosted in the cloud. Cloud security teams are responsible for developing and implementing security policies and procedures, and monitoring and responding to security incidents. Areas of focus:
    *   Develop and implement security policies and procedures – working with business stakeholders to develop and implement security policies and procedures that are specific to an organization's cloud environment, addressing security concerns such as access control, data encryption, and incident response.
    *   Monitor cloud environments for security threats and vulnerabilities – using tools and techniques for detecting unauthorized access, malicious activity, misconfigurations, and data exfiltration.
    *   Secure infrastructure and infrastructure as code – using languages like Terraform and other tools, implement cloud-first security architecture and technologies and ensure technology choices made by product teams continuously improve product resilience.
    *   Educate employees on cloud security best practices – including training employees on how to identify and report security threats.
*   **Security architecture**
    Security architecture is the practice of designing, developing, and implementing a security framework that protects an organization's assets from cyber threats. Security architecture teams are responsible for defining an organization's security requirements, designing and implementing security controls, and ensuring that the security framework is continuously monitored and updated. Areas of focus:
    *   Define security requirements – working with business stakeholders to define security requirements, including identifying assets, understanding the threats to those assets, and assessing risk tolerance.
    *   Design security controls – designing and implementing controls to protect an organization’s assets from cyber threats with a focus on firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption, and access control.
    *   Implement security controls – following working with operations teams to implement newly designed security controls, including configuring the controls, testing for effectiveness, and monitoring for compliance.
*   **Incident response**
    Incident response teams own the process of responding, containing, and resolving security incidents. Incident response teams must respond to security incidents rapidly to minimize the damage and impact. Areas of focus:
    *   Investigate incidents – working to investigate a detected incident to determine the scope and potential impact.
    *   Contain incidents – working to contain an incident to prevent further damage. Involving isolating the affected system, blocking access, and removing the malicious code.
    *   Eradicate threats – evicting bad actors, addressing the immediate vulnerability that was exploited and restoring the affected system to its original state.
    *   Learn from incidents – improving the incident response process, including documenting the incident, analyzing the incident, and developing recommendations for improvement.
*   **Data protection**
    Data protection is the practice of securing data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Data protection teams are responsible for implementing and maintaining controls to protect an organization's data. Areas of focus:
    *   Identify and classify data – focusing on all data that needs to be protected, identifying data type, sensitivity, and value.
    *   Develop data protection standards – developing and recommending security controls to protect the data, including implementing access control, encryption, and backup.
    *   Train teams on data protection – ensuring that users are awareness of data protection requirements.
    *   Monitoring control effectiveness – being prepared to respond to data protection violations and incidents with a plan in place to identify and contain them.
*   **Identity and access management**
    Identity and access management (IAM) practices ensure that only authorized users have access to an organization's systems and data. Areas of focus:
    *   Define identity and access management policies and procedures – including defining the different types of users, their roles and responsibilities, and the levels of access needed.
    *   Implement identity and access management controls – following the definition of identity and access management policies and procedures, implementing controls to enforce the policies such as implementing access control lists, multi-factor authentication, and password policies.
    *   Monitor and audit identity and access management controls – ensuring effective controls that include regularly reviewing logs and reports to detect any suspicious activity.
*   **Product management**
    Product management teams define, develop, launch, and maintain a product or service. Efforts often include end user support, integrations, and even support for go-to-market and sales teams looking to expand the products usage. Areas of focus:
    *   Define the product vision – in collaboration with the rest of the team, developing a vision statement of what the product is and what it hopes to achieve.
    *   Implement security features – ensuring products have security features that are enabled by default and designed into the product in its earliest stages.
    *   Build, deliver, and operate products – in collaboration with operations teams, ensuring the product is stable, secure, compliant, and continuously monitored.
    *   Work with engineers and designers – bringing the product vision to life through design feedback, prioritizing features, and managing the product development process.
    *   Manage the product life cycle – including tracking product usage and collecting customer feedback.
*   **Application management and support**
    Application management is the process of ensuring that software applications are running smoothly and efficiently. It includes tasks such as monitoring application performance, troubleshooting problems, and applying security patches. Application management teams are responsible for ensuring that applications are available to users when they need them and that they are performing at their best.

    Application support is the process of providing assistance to users of software applications. This includes tasks such as answering questions, resolving problems, and providing training. Application support teams are responsible for ensuring that users are able to use applications effectively and efficiently. Application management and support teams typically work together to ensure that software applications are running smoothly and efficiently. Application management teams focus on the technical aspects of application management, while application support teams focus on the user-facing aspects of application support. Areas of focus:
    *   Monitor application performance – ensuring that applications are running within acceptable levels through the collection of data on application metrics, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and database activity.
    *   Troubleshoot problems – troubleshooting problems when they occur, identifying the cause and finding a solution through activities such as reviewing logs, analyzing data, and performing tests.
    *   Apply improvements – protecting applications from vulnerabilities by identifying and downloading patches, testing patches, and deploying patches to production environments.
    *   Answer questions – offering support on how to use applications by providing information about application features, troubleshooting problems, and training.
    *   Resolve problems – addressing problems that users may experience with applications by troubleshooting problems, providing workarounds, and escalating problems to application management teams.
    *   Provide training – creating training materials, delivering training sessions, and answering questions from users on how to use applications.
*   **Software engineering**
    Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software. Teams take a systematic approach to the development of software that ensures that the software is reliable, efficient, and meets the needs of the users.

    Note that software engineering teams are responsible for the entire software development life cycle – from requirements gathering to deployment and maintenance. They use a variety of tools and techniques to ensure the software is high quality and meets users' needs. Areas of focus:

*   **Infrastructure engineering**
    Infrastructure engineering incorporates the discipline of designing, building, and maintaining the physical and virtual systems that support a company’s IT infrastructure. This includes everything from the servers and storage systems that store data, to the networks that connect them and the applications and software that run on them.

    Infrastructure engineer teams work with other members of the technology team – such as software developers, system administrators, and security engineers – to ensure that the infrastructure is reliable, scalable, and secure. They also work with business stakeholders to understand the company's needs and to design and implement solutions that meet those needs.

    Infrastructure engineers play a vital role in the success of any technology team. They are responsible for ensuring that the infrastructure is reliable, scalable, and secure, which in turn allows greater focus on developing and delivering innovative products and services. Areas of focus:
    *   Design and build new infrastructure systems – build and maintain compute, network, and storage systems in cloud and on premise.
    *   Upgrade and maintain existing infrastructure systems – maintain infrastructure and infrastructure systems, like power, cooling, energy, and others, such that core infrastructure stays up and running.
    *   Optimize the performance of infrastructure systems – monitor and adjust systems to increase performance, stability, reliability, capacity, and availability. Respond and correct issues in real time.
    *   Ensure that infrastructure systems are compliant with government regulations and standards – implement controls that ensure infrastructure is deployed and managed according to applicable rules and regulations.
    *   Troubleshoot and resolve infrastructure problems – find, diagnose, and correct issues that prevent infrastructure from operating effectively.
    *   Plan for and implement infrastructure changes – plan, schedule, and execute infrastructure changes.
    *   Work with other members of the technology team – ensuring that the infrastructure meets the needs of the business.
*   **Enterprise risk**
    Enterprise risk function (“Risk”) is a cross-functional team responsible for identifying, assessing, and managing risks that could impact the achievement of an organization's objectives.

    Risk plays a vital role in helping an organization identify, assess, and manage risks. In this way, Risk can help to protect you from financial losses, reputational damage, and other negative consequences. Areas of focus:
    *   Identify and assess risks – pinpointing risks that could impact the organization's objectives, including both internal and external risks such as operational, financial, strategic, and compliance risks.
    *   Develop and implement risk management strategies – managing identified and assessed risks through implementing controls, monitoring risks, and communicating risk information to stakeholders.
    *   Oversee risk management activities – overseeing risk management activities for an organization, including ensuring that risk management is integrated into all aspects of operations.
    *   Report on risk – reporting on the risks that the organization faces and the strategies that are in place to manage those risks across
