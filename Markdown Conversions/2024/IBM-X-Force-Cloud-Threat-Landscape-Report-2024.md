X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024Introduction

The IBM® X\-Force® team is well\-positioned within the security 
domain to provide organizations with industry best practices and 
strategies to aid in their cloud journey. Now in its fifth year of 
publication, the X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report provides 
a global cross\-industry perspective on how threat actors are 
compromising cloud environments, the malicious activities 
they’re conducting once inside compromised networks and the 
impact it’s having on organizations. 

To produce this report, X\-Force gathered and analyzed data 
compiled from June 2022 through June 2024 from the 
following sources:1

 – IBM X\-Force Threat Intelligence
 – IBM X\-Force Red penetration tests, as well as adversary 

simulation and vulnerability management 
services engagements 

 – IBM X\-Force incident response (IR) engagements 
 – Red Hat® Insights
 – Dark web analysis by X\-Force with data provided by report 

contributor Cybersixgill

With the cloud computing market expected to reach 
approximately USD 600 billion in 2024, the adoption of cloud 
infrastructure continues to rise. Organizations are increasingly 
moving business\-critical data from on premises to cloud 
infrastructure and services, driving the need for proper defensive 
measures and securing data in the cloud. Businesses are also 
seeking to maximize the value of their cloud investments and 
leverage the potential of AI and, therefore, must do so with an 
intentional approach. 

For organizations undergoing a cloud migration, transformation 
is a multistep process that takes time, energy and resources. 
The 2024 Cost of a Data Breach Report found approximately 
40% of all breaches involved data distributed across multiple 
environments, such as public clouds, private clouds and on 
premises. Therefore, as part of the migration process, 
it’s vital that organizations develop and implement proper 
security strategies and best practices to protect key 
organizational assets. 

Understanding the cloud threat landscape and its potential 
impacts on the business is essential for both IT and the C\-suite. 
This insight enables proactive measures to limit exposure 
and safeguard business\-critical information and resources, 
ensuring a secure and smooth cloud transformation journey and 
successful future implementations.

X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024Key takeways

In their data gathering and analysis, X\-Force uncovered the most 
prevalent security risks organizations could encounter from 
threat actors in their cloud journey. Here are the key takeaways.

Cross\-site scripting (XSS) 
leads as most impactful 
common vulnerabilities and 
exposures (CVE)

Continued demand for cloud 
credentials on the dark web 
despite market saturation

Increased use of trusted 
cloud\-based file hosting 
services for malicious 
activities

 – XSS vulnerabilities composed 27% of newly discovered CVE 

during the reporting period, which could allow threat actors to 
steal session tokens or redirect users to malicious web pages.

 – While the overall mentions of SaaS platforms on dark web 

marketplaces decreased by approximately 20% compared to 
2023, gaining access using compromised cloud credentials is 
the second most common initial attack vector. 

 – There’s been a steady decrease in the average price per 

compromised cloud access credentials, from USD 11\.74 in 
2022 to USD 10\.23 in 2024, equating to an overall decrease of 
12\.8% over a 3\-year period. 

 – Threat actors are increasingly leveraging trusted 

cloud\-based services, such as Dropbox, OneDrive and Google 
Drive, for command\-and\-control communications and 
malware distribution. 

 – North Korean state\-sponsored groups, including APT43 and 
APT37, carried out multistage attacks against cloud\-based 
services to distribute remote access trojans (RATs). 

3

X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024Phishing is the leading 
initial access vector

 – Phishing accounted for 33% of all cloud\-related incidents 
X\-Force responded to over the past 2 years, with attackers 
often using phishing to harvest credentials through adversary\-
in\-the\-middle (AITM) attacks. 

Frequent exploitation of 
valid credentials

 – 28% of cloud\-related incidents involved the use of legitimate 

credentials to get into victim environments. Often these 
accounts are overprivileged, with users having more privileges 
than needed to carry out their tasks, posing a significant 
security challenge for organizations. 

Business email compromise 
(BEC) going after credentials

 – BEC attacks, where attackers spoof email accounts posing 

as someone within the victim organization or another trusted 
organization, accounted for 39% of incidents over the past 2 
years. Threat actors commonly leverage harvested credentials 
from phishing attacks to take over email accounts to conduct 
further malicious activities. 

Compliance failures harm 
security of client cloud 
environments

 – The \#1 failed security rule in 100% cloud\-only environments 
involved improper configuration of essential security and 
management settings in Linux® systems. 

 – The \#1 failed security rule in environments where 50% 

or more of the systems are in the cloud involved the failure 
to ensure consistent and secure authentication and 
cryptography practices.

X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024Cloud vulnerabilities

Following last year’s analysis, X\-Force categorized new CVE 
according to their potential impact if they were to be 
successfully exploited. What X\-Force observed is obtaining 
information, gaining access and gaining privileges were the top 
3 impacts of the CVE discovered during the previous reporting 
period. This year, XSS, gaining access and obtaining information 
were the top 3 impacts of the CVE discovered. This year\-over\-
year comparison highlights a shift in the types of vulnerabilities 
being disclosed, with XSS emerging as a potentially significant 
threat. See Figure 1\. 

The exploitation of vulnerabilities is a top initial access vector for 
attackers. For example, XSS can be used to steal session tokens 
or redirect users to malicious web pages, while gaining access 
can lead to further exploitation of cloud resources. Ultimately, 
this exploitation can result in the deployment of cryptominers, 
infostealers, ransomware and other types of malware to achieve 
malicious objectives.

X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024Cloud and the dark web

For this year’s report, X\-Force researchers once again partnered 
with Cybersixgill to gain insights into how cybercriminals exploit 
cloud environments and infrastructure on the dark web. In doing 
so, X\-Force analyzed Cybersixgill data, pulled from various dark 
web forums and marketplaces between June 2023 and June 
2024, to help inform the following analysis. 

X\-Force observed a steady decrease in the average price per 
cloud access credentials on the dark web from USD 11\.74 in 
2022 to USD 10\.68 in 2023 and USD 10\.23 in 2024, equating to 
an overall decrease of 12\.8% since 2022\. See Figure 2\. 

This trend could indicate the market for compromised cloud 
credentials is becoming oversaturated, leading to a devaluation 
in credentials. Increasingly, organizations are shifting to the 
cloud, meaning more credentials are likely being stolen or 
compromised, raising the overall volume of for sale cloud access 
credentials. Additionally, each year defensive security measures 
for cloud infrastructure improves, such as the speed of detection 
and response capabilities, rendering these credentials less 
effective and, therefore, less valuable.

X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024While access to compromised cloud credentials continues to be 
a popular for sale asset on dark web marketplaces, especially 
regarding cloud\-based SaaS solutions, overall mentions of SaaS 
platforms on dark web marketplaces decreased by an average of 
20\.4% compared to 2023\. See Figure 3\. 

The reduction in mentions of these SaaS solutions on the 
dark web suggests a positive trend from a defensive security 
point of view. Reasons for this drop likely stem from law 
enforcement action and disruption of dark web marketplaces, 
which can severely impact the availability of stolen credentials 
and other listings. High\-profile takedowns, such as Nemesis 
marketplace, highlight this outcome. Furthermore, as security 
around SaaS solutions improves, attackers may start to seek 
weaker alternatives to drive profit and conduct malicious 
activity. Organizations should continue to prioritize security, 
invest in advanced technologies, and foster a culture of security 
awareness and preparedness to maintain this shift.

Top\-mentioned SaaS solutions on the dark web

 – Research by X\-Force indicates Microsoft Outlook was the most 
frequently mentioned SaaS solution discussed in dark web 
marketplaces by a wide margin at 68%, followed by Zoom 
at 7%. 

 – The overall number of mentions for each SaaS platform in dark 
web marketplaces decreased significantly compared to 2023, 
except for Microsoft TeamViewer, which increased by 9%. 
Despite the slight increase, it only represented 1\.8% of total 
discussions regarding SaaS solutions. 

 – Notably, the most significant decrease in marketplace 

discussions was regarding WordPress\-Admin at 98%, followed 
by Microsoft Active Directory at 44% and ServiceNow at 38%.

The significant drop in mentions of the previously named SaaS 
platforms on the dark web can be attributed to a few factors. 
Shifts in threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), 
potential lack of return on investment (ROI), and enhanced 
security measures from enterprises, such as the implementation 
of advanced encryption, multifactor authentication (MFA) 
and robust patch management, have significantly reduced 
vulnerabilities and the exploitability of these solutions.

X\-Force observed that Lumma, RisePro and Vidar were the 
most popular infostealers sold on the dark web in 2024\. In 
comparison, the top infostealers in 2023 were Raccoon Stealer, 
Vidar and RedLine. Notably, Lumma and RisePro had little to 
no dark web activity in 2023, while Vidar was the second most 
popular stealer that year. Additionally, Raccoon Stealer was by 
far the most popular stealer at over 3 million mentions in 2023, 
but that number drastically dropped in 2024 to only 300,000\. 
See Figure 4\. 

Over the past year, international law enforcement collaboration 
led to the dismantling of major cybercriminal networks 
distributing Raccoon Stealer. Additionally, the emergence of new 
infostealers like Lumma and RisePro shifted the focus of threat 
actors, reducing the popularity of Raccoon Stealer.

X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024Targeting cloud\-based 
file hosting services, 
platforms and SaaS

Analysis from several X\-Force Red adversary simulation 
engagements revealed an increasing use of cloud\-based services 
for command\-and\-control communications, since these services 
are trusted by organizations and blend seamlessly with regular 
enterprise traffic. Adversaries are reconfiguring cloud\-based 
resources to facilitate their objectives and grant themselves 
elevated privileges. 

Additionally, X\-Force observed cloud\-based services targeted in 
the following 2 ways: 

Cloud\-based file hosting services: 
Malware distribution

X\-Force has continued to observe threat actors widely using 
cloud\-based file hosting services, such as Dropbox, OneDrive 
and Google Drive, to distribute malicious software that appears 

to be legitimate. 3 notable malware campaigns include 2 from 
North Korean state\-sponsored groups: 

 – APT43, which has been leveraging Dropbox to facilitate a 
multistage attack campaign involving malware known as 
TutorialRAT 

 – APT37, which has been conducting a widespread phishing 
campaign using OneDrive to distribute RokRAT malware 

The third notable campaign is an email spam campaign using 
OneDrive to host and distribute Bumblebee malware. These 
campaigns successfully exploited the trusted nature of public 
cloud services by bypassing traditional security measures and 
effectively delivering malware to unsuspecting users.

X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024Cloud platforms and services: 
Infostealers, cryptominers 
and ransomware

In 2024 there’s been a continuous trend of credential theft from 
infostealers specifically designed to exfiltrate credentials from 
cloud services. Many popular infostealers, such as RedLine, 
Raccoon Stealer, Vidar, Lumma, MetaStealer and Stealc, as well 
as different hacking toolkits, such as FBot, AlienFox and Legion, 
have been targeting cloud platforms. These platforms include 
AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and other SaaS solutions, 
such as Office 365, Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) and 
Salesforce. 

These infostealers and hacking toolkits have been used to steal 
platform and service\-specific credentials, including: 

 – Cloud infrastructure credentials, such as AWS Identity and 
Access Management (IAM), Microsoft Azure Active Directory, 
Google Cloud IAM and Snowflake, control access to cloud 
resources, such as virtual machines, storage and databases. 

 – Cloud storage credentials, such as Dropbox, Box and 

Microsoft OneDrive, allow attackers to exfiltrate sensitive files 
and documents. 

 – Cloud\-based email services, such as Office 365 and Gmail, 
contain valuable communication data and may be used for 
password reset procedures for other cloud services. 

 – Cloud\-based collaboration tool credentials on platforms, 

such as Microsoft Teams, Slack or Google Workspace, where 
sensitive information is often shared among team members, 
are often targeted. 

 – Cloud\-based development platforms, such as WordPress, 
GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket, are used to steal credentials 
for accessing source code repositories, potentially obtaining 
proprietary code or sensitive development information. 
 – Cloud\-based customer relationship management (CRM) 
systems, such as Salesforce, contain a wealth of customer 
data. Stolen credentials can provide unauthorized access to 
valuable customer information. 

There’s been a continuous trend of 
credential theft from infostealers 
specifically designed to exfiltrate 
credentials from cloud services. 

X\-Force researchers have also observed cryptominers being 
deployed in cloud environments, highlighting the critical need for 
robust cloud security measures. Kinsing, a notorious malware 
family, has increasingly targeted and launched cryptominers 
inside cloud environments. For instance, Kinsing hides as 
a system file, specifically manual file or man page, to avoid 
detection while exploiting vulnerabilities inside cloud containers 
to deploy cryptomining operations on cloud servers. 

In addition, ransomware has become a prevalent threat in 
recent years, frequently making headlines with attacks on 
various organizations worldwide. However, the impact on cloud 
environments often goes unnoticed. An incident involving 
CloudNordic, a Danish cloud\-hosting company, starkly illustrates 
this growing issue. The reported ransomware attack led to 
the complete loss of all customer data. The attack exploited 
a vulnerability during a data center migration, encrypting all 
servers and backup systems. Despite existing security measures, 
the company couldn’t recover data and chose not to pay the 
ransom. This incident demonstrates ransomware’s severe impact 
on cloud environments, emphasizing the necessity for security 
best practices, mitigation strategies and effective disaster 
recovery plans. 

10

X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024Initial access vectors

The following outlines the techniques threat actors employed to 
gain initial access, listed in order of most\-used vectors.

The use of valid credentials

Conducting phishing campaigns

Despite the multitude of tactics and techniques used by threat 
actors to gain initial access into victim networks, phishing 
was the \#1 tactic of choice, used in 33% of all cloud\-related 
incidents that X\-Force responded to over the past 2 years. 
Specifically, attackers use phishing as a starting point for AITM 
attacks in which they harvest credentials from the recipient of a 
phishing email after tricking them into entering login information 
on an attacker\-controlled login page.

The use of valid credentials was the \#2 initial infection vector 
in attacks where cloud infrastructure was a potential target 
in the attack surface. Over the past 2 years, 28% of incidents 
involved the use of legitimate credentials as an initial access 
vector. Organizations continue to face challenges balancing 
their user access levels and security risk. These challenges are 
demonstrated most clearly in situations where attackers gain 
access to overprivileged user or service accounts and can do 
more damage in the environment.

Phishing was the \#1 tactic, used in 33% 
of all cloud\-related incidents. 

11

X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024Exploiting public\-facing applications 

Top initial access vectors 

The third most common vector is exploiting vulnerabilities in 
public\-facing applications. It remains a reliable method for 
threat actors to gain access to both cloud and on\-premises 
environments. This exploitation accounted for 22% of cloud\-
related incidents. See Figure 5\. 

Managing cloud applications—and access to them—poses 
a significant challenge for organizations, particularly as the 
number of applications and services continues to grow in 
modern cloud or hybrid cloud environments. If not implemented 
correctly, there’s a risk of overlooking unpatched applications 
running in the cloud or, even worse, being unaware they exist 
and are running in the first place.

First, in May 2024, a critical Microsoft Outlook remote code 
execution vulnerability (CVE\-2024\-21413\) emerged as a 
significant threat to cloud environments. Malicious actors 
can exploit this vulnerability through phishing emails and, 
if successful, can seize and manipulate communications, 
compromising cloud\-based email services and other sensitive 
cloud resources. 

Second, in July 2024, a critical vulnerability was disclosed in 
OpenSSH servers containing sshd on glibc\-based Linux systems. 
This vulnerability, known as regreSSHion and tracked as 
CVE\-2024\-6387, can allow an unauthenticated attacker to 
execute remote code on a vulnerable system with root privileges. 
OpenSSH is a widely deployed connectivity tool in cloud 
environments for remote login with the Secure Shell 
(SSH) protocol.

Exploiting vulnerabilities in public\-facing 
applications remains a reliable method 
for threat actors to gain access to both 
cloud and on\-premises environments.

12

X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024Actions on objective

Threat actors used several avenues to gain access to accomplish 
their goals. X\-Force found the following to be their most popular 
actions on objective.

In this scenario, attackers use a proxy server to intercept the 
authentication process between the target and a legitimate 
service. This strategy allows the attacker to collect the target’s 
credentials and token that’s generated upon successful MFA 
input from the target, enabling an authenticated session to be 
maintained for the attacker to use. See Figure 6\. 

Business email compromise 

X\-Force has repeatedly observed threat actors abusing cloud\-
hosted Active Directory servers to conduct business email 
compromise attacks within victim environments. This activity 
accounted for 39% of incident response engagements over 
the last 2 years, which made it the \#1 action on objective. 
More specifically, threat actors are frequently leveraging AITM 
phishing tactics to bypass user MFA. 

13

X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024If the attack is successful, the threat actor has authenticated 
using the victim’s credentials and is able to perform any action 
inside the application. In most cases, the attacker can send 
phishing emails from the compromised account, add mail 
forwarding rules or even log into additional cloud resources that 
share the same enterprise login credentials.

Cryptomining

Making up 22% of incidents over the past 2 years, cryptomining 
was the second most common action on objective, remaining 
popular among threat actors, especially in cloud environments. 
Because it’s extremely resource\-intensive, powerful cloud 
infrastructure is a perfect location to deploy cryptomining 
malware. Additionally, users are less likely to notice the effect 
of this malware when it isn’t running locally on their endpoint. 
See Figure 7\. 

Credential harvesting

Credential harvesting is one of many techniques threat actors 
employ to steal user authentication credentials to conduct 
further malicious activities, typically using phishing, keylogging, 
and watering hole and brute force attacks. Credential harvesting 
attacks was the third most common action on objective, 
accounting for 11% of incidents. It’s commonplace that stolen 
credentials are listed and sold on dark web marketplaces or used 
to compromise other accounts. See Figure 7\.

X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024Security rule failures 
in cloud\-based 
environments

As part of IBM’s partnership with Red Hat Insights, X\-Force 
analyzed 2 sets of data from approximately 100 Red Hat Insights 
compliance service clients globally. The first set of data was from 
clients operating in 100% cloud\-only environments, whereas 
the second set of data included clients with 50% or more of their 
systems in the cloud. X\-Force assessed the security rules for 
their respective environments. These security rule or compliance 
failures provide key insights on how organizations can mitigate 
potential risks to their cloud environments. 

Organizations operating in fully or partially integrated cloud 
environments frequently encountered significant challenges 
in maintaining a robust security posture, as evidenced by the 
repeated failures of key security rules in Red Hat Insights 
client environments. These failures often stemmed from the 
complexity of configuring and enforcing security policies 
consistently across dynamic and expansive cloud infrastructures. 
The context around setting up firewall zones, isolating file 
systems and applying secure mount options require specialized 
knowledge and diligent monitoring, which can be challenging for 
IT and security teams. Furthermore, the reliance on outdated 
practices, manual configurations and insufficient automation 
tools can exacerbate these issues, leading to more security 
misconfigurations and an increase in vulnerabilities. 

15

In the broader context, these technical issues in cloud 
infrastructure should signal substantial risks to organizations, 
including the increased likelihood of cyberattacks, 
noncompliance with regulatory standards and operational 
deficiencies. As cloud environments continue to grow and evolve, 
it becomes vital for organizations to adopt comprehensive 
security measures, strategies and best practices. These 
measures enable them to fully leverage the benefits of cloud 
technologies while protecting critical assets and maintaining 
operational success and regulatory compliance. 

Rule failures in cloud infrastructure 
signal substantial risks to organizations.

Top 5 failed rules for 
100% cloud environments 

From the Red Hat Insights data X\-Force analyzed, the following 
highlights the top 5 security rules that frequently failed within 
100% cloud environments, and the recommended guidance to 
resolve them. See Figure 8\.

Rule 1\. Configuration and security guidelines for 
Linux systems (29%)
This rule set focuses on configuring essential security and 
management settings in Linux systems, including setting the 
default zone for firewalld and isolating the /tmp directory on a 
separate partition to enhance security and manage disk space 
effectively. To mitigate: 

 – Configure the default zone for the firewalld service 

to ensure proper network security configurations in Red Hat\-
based systems. 

 – Isolate the /tmp directory on a separate partition to enhance 
security and manage disk space effectively, preventing denial 
of service attacks and improving system performance. 

16

X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024Rule 2\. Secure mount options for critical directories (27%)
This rule set emphasizes configuring secure mount options for 
critical directories by preventing the execution of binaries, the 
creation of device files, and the execution of setUID and setGID 
programs, thereby enhancing security and enforcing proper 
directory use. To mitigate, prevent the:

surface, enhance security and free up system resources. 
To mitigate: 

 – Disable the rpcbind service.
 – Disable the NFS service. 

Rule 5\. NFS service management (10%) 
This rule set is exclusively dedicated to the management of the 
NFS service, emphasizing its specific role in network file sharing 
and the security implications of having this service enabled 
unnecessarily. To mitigate: 

 – Disable the NFS service to reduce the attack surface, enhance 
security and free up system resources. NFS allows file sharing 
between systems over a network but, if not required, disabling 
it can improve security and performance.

 – Execution of binaries in the /var/log directory 
 – Creation of device files in the /var/log directory
 – Execution of setUID and setGID programs in the 

/var/log/audit directory

 – Creation of device files in the /home directory
 – Creation of device files in the /var directory

X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024Cloud and AI

Although cybercriminal and state\-sponsored threat actors 
have been conducting global phishing and spam campaigns to 
spread various malware through cloud services, the near\-term 
threat from AI\-generated attacks targeting cloud environments 
remains moderately low. Still, there’s a possibility threat actors 
are already leveraging AI to carry out malicious activities against 
cloud environments. X\-Force research has shown AI can be 
used to develop sophisticated social engineering prompts and 
phishing campaigns in a fraction of the time it would take a 
human to craft a convincing phishing email. 

Furthermore, X\-Force has observed Hive0137, an extremely 
active malware distributor since at least October 2023, likely 
leveraging large language models (LLMs) to assist in script 
development, as well as creating authentic and unique phishing 
emails. While AI tools can allow attackers to potentially improve 
the authenticity of their lure materials, making it easier for threat 
actors to evade detection, the use of AI technology for malicious 
activities is early in its maturity curve. 

In terms of attacking AI platforms, whether deployed in the 
cloud or on premises, there’s a complexity hurdle to overcome 
and, in its current state, the immediate return on investment isn’t 
worthwhile. However, as the AI market matures and becomes 
more integrated into business operations across industries, 
the attack surface can widen, and threat actors can be more 
incentivized to conduct attacks. X\-Force analysis projects that 
when a single generative AI technology approaches 50% market 
share or when the market consolidates to 3 or less technologies, 
it could trigger at\-scale attacks against these platforms. 
Organizations are encouraged to refer to the recommendations 
in this report, which can help mitigate the risk of cyberthreats 
whether they emanate using AI or not.

Threat actors may already be leveraging 
AI to carry out malicious activities 
against cloud environments.

X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024Recommendations

Considering the evolving cloud threat landscape, organizations 
must continuously monitor, adapt and enhance their security 
strategies to safeguard cloud and SaaS environments. 

X\-Force has observed organizations improving cloud security by 
enhancing email protections and requiring MFA for cloud access, 
making phishing attacks more difficult. However, protecting 
identity and data in cloud and SaaS environments requires 
ongoing adjustments to address evolving threats. 

Here are some recommendations to help build a robust 
framework for improving cloud security.

21

X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2024Conduct comprehensive preparation 
and testing 

A proactive, holistic security approach is paramount in the cloud 
landscape. Integrate security throughout development through 
secure DevOps, threat modeling and rigorous testing to build 
resilience. Automation minimizes human error and helps ensure 
continuous compliance, enabling organizations to navigate 
evolving threats with confidence.

Build a stronger identity security posture 

A streamlined identity management strategy is no longer a 
luxury, but a necessity. Simplify identity policies to strike a 
balance between robust security and user\-friendly experiences. 
Embrace modern authentication methods, such as MFA, and 
explore passwordless options, such as a QR code or FIDO2 
authentication, to fortify defenses against unauthorized access.

Design secure AI strategies to stay ahead 
of cloud threats

Harnessing the power of AI is crucial for staying ahead of 
evolving cloud threats. AI offers transformative potential to 
revolutionize authentication and identification, enhancing 
both the efficiency and security of these critical processes. As 
generative AI continues to advance, safeguard the integrity of 
data and models with robust encryption and access controls.

Organizations must proactively manage risks associated with 
shadow AI and unsanctioned use of AI tools in the workplace, 
helping ensure transparency and control over AI initiatives. 
Additionally, organizations should prepare for the potential 
impact quantum\-enabled threats could have on the long\-term 
security of AI projects.

Strengthen incident response capabilities 

In today’s dynamic threat landscape, a swift and effective 
incident response can make all the difference. Leverage 
security threat intelligence to understand attacker motivations 
and respond more rapidly. During investigations, preserving 
forensic evidence by redeploying affected machines, rather than 
reimaging them, helps ensure critical data is retained. Regular 
testing of disaster recovery and backup procedures is also 
essential for business continuity and resilience. 

Protect data with robust 
security measures

Data protection remains a cornerstone of a comprehensive 
cloud security strategy. Encrypt data in storage, use and transit, 
and manage keys securely to help ensure sensitive information 
is safeguarded. Organizations should minimize data exposure 
by reducing the amount of sensitive data stored and limiting 
access strictly to necessary personnel. Automating security 
group privileges and decommissioning dormant accounts further 
enhances security by adhering to the principle of least privilege 
and preventing potential account compromises.
