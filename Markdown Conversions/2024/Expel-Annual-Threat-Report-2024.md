# Annual Threat Report 2024

## Cybersecurity insights, resilience recommendations, and predictions

Expel’s operators do a massive amount of analysis, triage, and complicated problem-solving—stopping intricate attacks every single day.

It’s our responsibility to take lessons learned from our varied customer base and share those insights with others in our community in the interest of banding together against our common adversaries.

For each of the top trends we explore, we’ll tell you what we saw, how to detect these threats and protect your organization, and what to watch for in 2024. We cap it off with some thoughts and predictions for cybersecurity this year, courtesy of our leadership team and some of the smartest folks in the industry (who also happen to be Expletives).

We delve into the data to identify trends and patterns in the security events we’re seeing and translate them into strategic guidelines your organization can put into play right away. Whether it’s hardening your environment against specific known threats or improving measures to detect bad actors who find their way past the first lines of defense, we’re in this together and strong, collaborative information sharing is key.

### Letter from the CEO

Dave Merkel
CEO, Expel

> “We’re in this together and strong, collaborative information sharing is key.”

Thanks for taking the time to review our Annual Threat Report. I know firsthand that the day of a cyber operator is a busy one and it’s not easy to find time to read and digest such an extensive report.

The challenges you face every day are complex, fast-moving and constantly evolving, so it’s our goal to provide a resource packed with intel that is both valuable and actionable for protecting your organization.

Much of the information included in this report originates from our technology stack, but it’s the experience and the expertise that our analysts bring to the fight which enables our SOC team to go beyond the technology and protect our customers. These people are the best in the business, and they work behind the scenes to keep our customers (and Expel) safe.

People are at the core of the work we do, and although a modern security strategy and the right technology are critical, without a high-performing SOC, security teams will lose more often than they win. Effective, modern SOC operations enable and empower analysts to make effective real-time decisions that protect the enterprises entrusted to them. We believe this passionately and it’s for this reason that we’re sharing this information and intelligence with you, the cybersecurity community.

### Letter from the VP, Security Operations

Daniel Clayton
VP, Security Operations

> “Effective, modern SOC operations enable and empower analysts to make effective real-time decisions that protect the enterprises entrusted to them.”

# Executive summary

## Key insights and takeaways

Now in its third installment, the trends, predictions, and recommendations discussed in this report are based primarily on incidents our security operations center (SOC) identified through investigations into alerts, email submissions, vulnerability disclosures, and threat-hunting leads spanning January 1 to December 31, 2023. We relied on a combination of time-series analyses, statistics, customer input, and analyst expertise to generate these insights.

To make it easy to follow along, we’ve broken this report into four different threat types: identity, cloud, computer-based, and phishing. Keep in mind, though, that these threats are tightly related. Compromise of user identities can occur through phishing and can impact an organization’s cloud assets and endpoints, or malicious activity on an endpoint may be indicative of an exploited vulnerability. We’ll highlight that interconnectivity throughout.

**OUR TOP TAKEAWAYS:**

### Identity-based incidents dominate three years in a row

Identity threats accounted for 64% of all incidents our SOC investigated and increased in volume by 144% from 2022. Of those incidents, 60% were unauthorized email logins and 40% were authentications to identity platforms, like Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory), Okta, Ping, and Duo.

Of the organizations targeted with an identity attack:

*   35% experienced more than one incident (up from 24% in 2022)
*   Organizations saw an average of eight identity-based incidents over the year
*   One nonprofit organization was targeted 255 times (up from 104 times in 2022 at the same organization)

> Identity threats accounted for 64% of all incidents our SOC investigated and increased in volume by 144% from 2022.

Sixty-nine percent of identity-based incidents involved malicious logins from suspicious infrastructure, which are hosting providers or proxies that aren’t expected for a user or organization. We’ve noted in past years a shift toward using more proxies, VPNs, and hosting providers to bypass network zone and conditional access policies, and we expect we’ll continue to see this trend until organizations consistently put effective roadblocks in place—such as phish-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) and policies to block suspicious logins.

### Phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) drives identity-based incidents

The increased volume of identity incidents noted above is a direct result of more phishing platforms becoming available on the dark market. Several of these harvesters can both pre-fill the intended victim’s email address and load the appropriate branding and background for the target organization’s login page, making these pages look convincingly like the expected login page.

It’s not surprising to see another branch of cybercrime-as-a-service (CaaS) gain traction—it’s accessible, convenient, and available with a low barrier to entry. Unfortunately, that means it’s not going away anytime soon and we’re only likely to see this attack vector grow in 2024.

### The rise of QR code phishing

The recent uptick in QR code phishing—or qishing—is cause for concern because it takes the activity off endpoints and puts it on mobile devices, which may not be managed with tight security controls—allowing the attacker to bypass endpoint security. We found that Microsoft’s threat intelligence can reliably identify phishing pages created with PhaaS platforms. However, Microsoft’s effectiveness in identifying these pages may have inadvertently contributed to an increase in threat actors’ use of QR codes for phishing.

> Personal devices typically lack the same level of protection as endpoint devices, meaning threat actors may be able to bypass the usual security barriers more easily.

Personal devices typically lack the same level of protection as endpoint devices, meaning threat actors may be able to bypass the usual security barriers more easily. It’s pivotal users become as wary of unexpected QR codes as they are URLs (or at least, as they should be).

### Threat groups favor social engineering tactics to mimic employees and target organizations

“The Com,” a hacking group including the actors tracked as “Scattered Spider,” was responsible for the largest number of targeted identity attacks our SOC investigated this year. These attackers primarily targeted Okta and Microsoft accounts, attempting to abuse password reset mechanisms and MFA push fatigue to gain access.

We observed two main attack tactics:

*   Calling into an organization’s helpdesk
*   Abusing self-service password reset mechanisms

When calling into the helpdesk, the actors impersonate staff and request that their passwords be reset. If either the helpdesk or self-service password request attempts are successful, the threat actor sends MFA pushes to the real user. If the user accepts the MFA push, the attacker gains access to the account.

Attackers spend a stunning amount of time conducting thorough research on possible victims to mimic their speech patterns. Of note, “The Com” primarily targeted customers in the financial services industry in the second half of the year. We expect this attack style to continue into 2024, especially as generative AI has the potential to make this kind of impersonation even easier.

### Cloud infrastructure incidents trend up, with stolen or leaked cloud credentials (aka secret) exposure as the biggest and most frequent risk

This year, we noted a 72% increase in cloud infrastructure incidents, roughly consistent with what we saw in 2022 and continuing the upward trend since we began supporting Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and Kubernetes. Exposed credentials (or secrets) were the leading root cause of cloud infrastructure incidents (42%). Publicly exposed or stolen credentials allow attackers to maintain persistent access to the cloud environment with the permissions tied to that identity or role.

### Common misconfiguration of Amazon Cognito (aka AWS Cognito) allows attackers to gain direct access to AWS control plane

Amazon Cognito (also known as AWS Cognito) enables user sign-up and authentication to apps, but administrators frequently misconfigure the service. In these cases, an attacker can do things like create new accounts with excessive permissions or even access AWS credentials associated with the Cognito Identity Pool.

This year, security researchers released a few Amazon Cognito auditing tools. While these help operators identify misconfiguration, threat actors can also take advantage: we’re seeing more of these AWS Cognito focused attacks seemingly enabled by the auditing tools. But the misconfigurations that lead to these attacks are common—and thus, effective—for a reason. We wrote more about what to know and understand about Amazon Cognito in this recent [blog post](https://expel.com/blog/aws-cognito-misconfigurations-and-how-to-detect-them/).

### More than half of all malware incidents presented an immediate, significant risk

We separate malware into categories based on its functionality. In more than half the malware incidents, the malware deployed presented an immediate and significant risk to the environment (what we would classify as “high-risk”)—including risks of pre-ransomware activity or exfiltration. Pre-ransomware accounted for 57% of the malware incidents our SOC investigated.

> In more than half the malware incidents, the malware deployed presented an immediate and significant risk to the environment.

The most frequent malware cases we classified as pre-ransomware included:

*   Gootloader—17% of high-risk malware incidents
*   Qakbot—12%
*   SocGholish—11%

It’s worth noting that these were also the top pre-ransomware threats we reported in both 2021 and 2022. The skilled actors behind these threats have been active for a while; they’ll likely continue to be active for the foreseeable future.

### Attackers trick users with sneaky infostealers downloaded from malicious ads with cloned versions of legitimate websites

Infostealers—malware that accesses sensitive data, like passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, and other information stored in the user’s browsers or on their devices—provide a wide range of options for an attacker.

While infostealing malware can be targeted, threat actors most frequently deployed it opportunistically. Adversaries often take advantage of a user looking to download software. “Cracked” software, or software that generally requires a license but attackers have modified to circumnavigate that requirement, represents the highest risk. In these situations, users are more likely to act against their better judgment in downloading software from a sketchy website to avoid buying a paid version.

This year, we saw a lot of infostealers downloaded from malicious ads (also known as malvertising). These ads appear at the top of search results and often imitate productivity or IT software. Clicking the ad directs the user to a cloned version of the legitimate software’s website. When the software downloads and runs, the malware executes the malicious payload—sometimes even installing the legitimate software to avoid suspicion.

### Shadow IT represents a growing concern for security teams

We frequently saw attackers leveraging both search engine ads and SEO poisoning to guide users to download malicious payloads. These attacks target both Windows and MacOS systems, and the main types of malware used in these attacks are remote access tools (RATs) and infostealers.

Common “lures” include:

*   Software used by IT teams (such as Advanced IP Scanner, Nmap, WinSCP)
*   Productivity software (such as Notion, Notepad++, and PDF manipulation tools)

Shadow IT attacks became a fad for threat actors in 2023. Google and Microsoft actively work to combat the tactic, but we expect malvertising to remain popular into 2024 (and, ultimately, for as long as it works).

### Zero-days emphasize importance of defense-in-depth and strong layers of control

Here are the top vulnerabilities our SOC identified based on incident frequency:

*   Progress’ MOVEit Transfer (CVE-2023-34362)
*   Adobe ColdFusion (CVE-2023-26360)
*   Citrix NetScaler ADC, also known as CitrixBleed (CVE-2023-4966)

Properly configured and implemented security controls—or the lack thereof—directly affect the impact of these vulnerabilities on an organization. All of these vulnerabilities were zero-days, but there’s good news: security teams can identify zero-day exploitation when it happens thanks to defense-in-depth and by understanding common attacker tactics.

### Bad actors trended toward script-based files for pre-ransomware initial access

JavaScript made up the highest volume of files at 39%, but we also saw lots of other scripting types, including executable (EXE—20%), LNK (12%), and VBS (7%) files.

JS and VBS are text files that receive less scrutiny from automated analysis mechanisms than EXE files. Unlike EXE, attackers can hide their functionality among benign content or by command obfuscation. By default, the native Windows program, wscript.exe, will execute these scripts when a user double-clicks the files. Attackers use this setting to their advantage, so we highly recommend changing this default setting, which can be done using a group policy object (GPO).

### Witness the power of secure-by-default to fully stop threat vectors

At the very end of 2022, we saw the beginning of a new trend toward leveraging OneNote files in attacks. In January 2023, Microsoft pushed a patch to slow down the exploitation, and ultimately implemented much stronger controls in March, virtually killing the technique.

This not only illustrates how Microsoft can eliminate a threat vector, but it also proves that if organizations adopt tight controls, they also have the power to fully stop a threat vector.

### Hospitality, travel, tech, and financial services stand out as heavily targeted industries

Hospitality held onto the top spot for industries targeted by phishing attacks for the second year in a row with the highest volume at 55%. It’s followed—but not closely—by travel (12%), technology (9%), financial services, and healthcare (5% each).

> Hospitality held onto the top spot for industries targeted by phishing attacks for the second year in a row with the highest volume of targeted attacks at 55%.

Hospitality, technology, and financial services also made the list of top industries where we identified the most high-risk malware and identity incidents. We recommend that organizations in heavily targeted industries take extra security measures, including phishing training, strong endpoint defenses, and regular reviews of the environment based on user-identified malicious emails.

### Infostealer campaign targeting hospitality customers since 2022

Since 2022, our SOC has observed an infostealing campaign targeting our hospitality customers with the goal of gaining administrative access to sites like Booking.com to commit fraud.

The campaign has developed over time, but it generally looks like this: an attacker uses a Gmail account to request information about a booking, ask for help, or to lodge a complaint. Instead of an attachment, the email contains a link to a file storage service such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and Mega.nz.

In most situations, the files in the storage service are a file archive (ZIP, RAR, etc.), which is password-protected to prevent the storage provider from scanning its contents. When the user opens the file, the archive typically contains an inflated EXE file which is an infostealer.

Though this campaign targets hospitality companies, understanding it is extremely valuable for organizations in other industries, too. As a common threat vector, infostealing malware can affect any organization.

# 2023 by the numbers

## Incident types detected by the Expel SOC

Incident types in 2023 vs. 2022 (Chart 1):

*   Identity continues to reign supreme, with a 14% increase out of overall incidents from the previous year. Our analysts work multiple identity-based incidents a day and we expect this trend to continue upward.
*   Of note: while malware as a percentage of overall incidents decreased by 25% in 2023, the potential impact of both high-risk and latent-risk malware should not be discounted.
*   Phishing incidents tripled from 2% in 2022 to 6% in 2023.
*   The percentage of authorized penetration tests and red teams we investigated decreased 43%. While we can only speculate, this could indicate that customers are dealing with tighter budgets and not performing these exercises as often.

**Chart 1: Breakdown of incidents detected by the Expel SOC in 2022 and 2023**

*A bar chart showing the percentage of incidents by type for 2022 and 2023. The types are Server-side exploit, Red team / pen test, Phishing, Malware, and Identity. In 2023, Identity is the highest at around 64%, followed by Malware at around 20%, then Phishing at around 6%, then Red team/pen test at around 4%, and finally Server-side exploit at around 2%. In 2022, Identity is also the highest but at a lower percentage of around 50%, followed by Malware at around 45%, then Red team/pen test at around 7%, then Server-side exploit at around 2%, and finally Phishing at around 2%.*

## Initial alert sources in 2023 and 2022 (Chart 2):

*   Year over year, we see attackers targeting cloud infrastructure, as cloud incidents increased by 12% in 2023. Remember that monitoring your cloud is like planting a tree; the best time to start was five years ago. The second best time is right now.
*   Similar to malware in the chart above, endpoint incidents fell as a percentage of overall incidents in 2023.
*   We observed a slight decrease in initial alerts coming from network and SIEM as a percentage in 2023.

**Chart 2: Initial alert source**

*A bar chart showing the percentage of initial alerts by source for 2022 and 2023. The sources are SIEM, Phishing submission, Network, Endpoint, and Cloud. In 2023, SIEM is the highest at around 42%, followed by Endpoint at around 27%, then Cloud at around 17%, then Network at around 10%, and finally Phishing submission at around 4%. In 2022, SIEM is also the highest but at a lower percentage of around 45%, followed by Endpoint at around 30%, then Cloud at around 15%, then Network at around 10%, and finally Phishing submission at around 2%.*

# Identity threats

## Targeting email and identity platforms

Identity-based incidents were the most common attacks we saw across our customer base in 2023, accounting for 64% of all incidents handled by our SOC. The total of identity-based incidents rose 144% compared to 2022.

Chart 3 shows that within these identity incidents, 60% were unauthorized email logins (pre-BEC), and 40% were authentications to identity platforms (BAC), like Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory), Okta, Ping, and Duo. While email remains the top target for attackers, we urge security teams to consider attackers that target identity platforms a serious threat, too.

### 2023’s top threat

Over the course of 2023, the Expel SOC saw an overall increase in the number of identity incidents as the year progressed, until we saw a dip in frequency at the end of the year (perhaps due to normal seasonality). Take a look at Chart 4 on page 8 to see the peaks and valleys, as well as the overall increasing trend.

**Chart 3: BEC (email compromise) vs. BAC (application compromise) in 2023**

*A pie chart showing the percentage of BEC (email compromise) and BAC (application compromise) in 2023. BEC is 60.8% and BAC is 39.2%.*

### WHAT WE SAW IN OUR PREVIOUS ANNUAL REPORT

*   Representing 50% of all incidents, BEC attempts were the top threat to our customers in 2022.
*   60% of attempts to compromise cloud identity provider credentials (aka BAC activity) happened in Okta; 17% of the remainder were in Box and 6% were in Ping and OneLogin.
*   Nonprofit, retail, and entertainment were the industries most targeted by BEC attacks.
*   Of the organizations targeted by BEC threat actors:
    *   53% experienced at least one BEC attempt.
    *   24% experienced at least three BEC attempts.
    *   One organization was targeted 104 times in 2022.
*   BEC attackers moved away from authenticating via legacy protocols to bypass MFA in Microsoft 365. Instead, they increasingly adopted the use of frameworks such as Evilginx2 to steal login credentials and session cookies.
*   The number of BEC threat actors who successfully gained access to M365 accounts trended up. A main culprit was adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing to steal session cookies.

**Chart 4: The increase in identity incidents throughout 2023**

*A line graph showing the number of identity incidents over the months of 2023. The number of incidents generally increases from January to October, then decreases in November and December.*

The increased volume of identity incidents is a direct result of more phishing platforms becoming available on the dark market. “Phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS)” platforms allow a buyer to easily deploy convincing credential harvesters for a phishing campaign. Several of these harvesters can both pre-fill the intended victim’s email address and load the appropriate branding and background for the target organization’s login page, making them look convincingly like the expected login page.

> “Phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS)” platforms allow a buyer to easily deploy convincing credential harvesters for a phishing campaign.

### Risks of identity compromise

It goes without saying that identity compromise is serious. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI’s) most recent Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) statistics, Americans reported a combined loss of $2.7 billion over 2022 due to BEC attacks that weren’t stopped in their early stages. BAC was the attack type behind the much-publicized compromises at Uber, Nvidia, and Rockstar Games; in those incidents, attackers compromised user identities to gain access to sensitive data, sell it, and use it for extortion.

At Expel, mitigating identity threats is a priority. We understand many of these attacks attempt to leverage access as soon as possible, and we pride ourselves on our ability to detect and respond quickly to secure an account. Our goal is to respond to the compromise in real time as much as possible to prevent the attack from playing out. However, by taking action and stopping an attack, it becomes impossible to understand the full intent of that attack. In most situations, we classify the attack based on the type of account compromised.

As such, we classify evidence of a compromised user password as an identity incident. In some instances, MFA or conditional access blocks logins; however, we treat these with the same seriousness as an incident due to the high risk that would exist were the incident to play out. Many authentication blocking methods are but a small speed bump for attackers and require our analysts to take further action to prevent potentially successful attempts. In fact, we’ve seen many instances when an attacker tried to login, was blocked by conditional access based on geolocation or MFA, and immediately switched to a bypass method, like a VPN or legacy protocol, resulting in successful login.

Furthermore, compromise of credentials is evidence of another compromise: users may have entered credentials into a credential harvester, had their credentials stolen by an infostealer (more on these later), or been exposed due to a weak password or a previous data leak. Organizations should thoroughly investigate any situation where users could have unknowingly compromised their passwords.

### Identity incidents by industry verticals

Throughout 2023, threat actors targeted non-profit organizations most, followed by technology companies and financial services.

Chart 5 shows the percentage of identity incidents our SOC saw, broken down by industry. Like in past years, this breakdown shows that threat actors don’t discriminate—while some industries are targeted more often than others, none are immune.

**Chart 5: Identity incidents by vertical industry**

*A bar chart showing the percentage of identity incidents by industry. The industries are Travel, Health care, Hospitality, Entertainment, Pharmaceutical & chemical, Manufacturing, Retail, Financial services, Technology, and Non-profit. Non-profit is the highest at around 20%, followed by Technology at around 15%, then Financial services at around 12%, then Retail at around 10%, then Manufacturing at around 8%, then Pharmaceutical & chemical at around 7%, then Entertainment at around 6%, then Hospitality at around 5%, then Health care at around 3%, and finally Travel at around 2%.*

### Identity targeting frequency

Identity incidents affected 58% of our customers (up from 53% in 2022). But if we dig into the data and look at the frequency our customers are targeted, we get a clearer picture of the pervasiveness of these attacks.

Of the organizations targeted with an identity attack:

*   35% experienced more than one incident (up from 24% in 2022).
*   Organizations saw an average of eight identity-based incidents over the year.
*   One non-profit organization was targeted 255 times (up from 104 times in 2022).

> One non-profit organization was targeted 255 times (up from 104 times in 2022).

This data illustrates that some organizations are targeted more than others, and those with a lower public profile and more compensating controls are less likely to experience identity attacks.

### Identity incidents by source technology

We identified 88% of incidents based on signal from Microsoft products. This high targeting rate is due to Microsoft’s large business email and identity market share, which makes the company’s identity products an attractive target—similar to the way Windows operating systems are highly targeted by malware because of Microsoft’s prominent place in end-user operating systems.

Okta was a distant second place to Microsoft, being the source of 9% of identity incidents. Google Workspace (recently rebranded from G Suite), Duo, OneLogin, Ping, and a few others make up the remaining technologies.

### Malicious login sources

Sixty-nine percent of incidents in 2023 involved malicious logins from suspicious infrastructure, which are hosting providers or proxies that aren’t expected for a user or organization. These logins may not be geographically suspicious but are abnormal for the specific user. When we analyze abnormal logins, we’re looking at the details of the IP address associated with the login against the user’s or account’s baseline behavior.

Just over 10% of malicious logins came from VPNs, and the rest (about 21%) were identified through geolocation alerts. See Chart 6 for the breakdown.

This is consistent with a trend we noted in 2022—namely, that attackers were shifting to using more proxies, VPNs, and hosting providers to bypass network zone and conditional access policies. The takeaway? Organizations need to take any abnormal logins seriously.

Let’s look at an example: here’s a user logging in from the IP address 196.247.229.187, associated with Packet Exchange, which differs from the expected baseline.

We compare this information with the user’s baseline and often we’re able to identify clearly if the origin is normal or abnormal for the user.

**Chart 6: Breakdown of malicious login sources**

*A pie chart showing the breakdown of malicious login sources. Suspicious infrastructure is 69%, Geolocation is 21%, and VPN is 10%.*

### QR code attacks

We found that Microsoft’s threat intelligence can reliably identify phishing pages created with PhaaS platforms. Customers using Microsoft’s Defender for Endpoint product regularly received alerts for users accessing credential harvesters. However, Microsoft’s effectiveness in identifying these pages may have inadvertently contributed to an increase in threat actors’ use of QR codes.

Qishing attacks take the activity off endpoints—which Microsoft defenses have visibility into—and put it on mobile devices, which may not be managed with tight security controls. This allows the attacker to bypass endpoint controls.

### How to protect your organization from malicious login sources

*   Deploy phish-resistant MFA.
*   If FIDO-only factors for MFA are unrealistic, opt for push notifications.
    *   If feasible for your environment, configure identity provider policies to restrict access to managed devices.
*   Pay close attention to detections related to suspicious logins.
    *   Pay close attention to detections related to suspicious logins. Most technologies will monitor for user behavior that differs from the baseline but these alerts do no good unless they’re reviewed and analyzed by security or IT teams.
    *   Use vendor technologies that identify or block authentication attempts with previously unseen authentication characteristics, such as impossible travel, unusual locations for the environment, or a new device for the account.
*   Use policies to block access from suspicious logins based on IP address(es), autonomous system numbers (ASN), IP types, or geolocation, and configure pre-auth policies.
*   Of note: when analyzing these alerts, remember that malicious logins don’t only occur from suspicious locations or VPNs—a lot also come from hosting providers and proxies.
*   Use password managers to create, store, and share passwords. These allow users to create unique, complex passwords and store them in a way that keeps them safe from attackers and infostealer malware.

### How to protect your organization from QR code attacks

Microsoft only recently released new features to address qishing, so we have yet to see the full impact of its response. We believe that to make a real impact, Microsoft needs to block QR codes by default. If Microsoft makes the settings configurable, we recommend organizations opt for the strictest QR code settings.

For organizations that aren’t using Microsoft products, it’s still important to understand these tactics and ensure users are wary of QR codes just as they might be wary of a URL. And, if an organization uses QR codes for any reason, it should make end users (customers, partners, employees, vendors, etc.) aware of when and how it uses them.

## Targeted attacks

“The Com,” a hacking group including the actors tracked as “Scattered Spider,” was responsible for the largest number of targeted identity attacks this year. These attackers primarily targeted Okta and Microsoft accounts, attempting to abuse password reset mechanisms and MFA push fatigue to gain access.

We observed two main attack tactics: (1) calling into an organization’s helpdesk, and (2) abusing self-service password reset mechanisms.

When calling into the helpdesk the actors impersonated staff and requested that their passwords be reset. If either the helpdesk or self-service request attempts were successful, the threat actor sent MFA pushes to the real user. If the user accepted the MFA push, the attacker gained access to the account.

Attacks from these actors are high-volume, too. In one environment, an attacker submitted password reset attempts for more than 100 accounts. In multiple attacks, organizations blocked the attempts thanks to controls that required authentications from a compliant device. Of note, in the second half of the year, the threat actor primarily targeted customers in the financial services industry. We expect this style of attack to continue in 2024.

According to Microsoft, these actors perform thorough research on possible victims and mimic their speech styles. Others in the industry have sounded the alarm on how AI can make this type of impersonation even easier.

### How to protect your organization from targeted attacks

Test password reset security controls in your organization. What processes do you have in place for employees calling for a reset? Are those processes required for all employees? Are they followed all the time? Having security controls in place is vital, and regular testing ensures the controls work as expected.

> Having security controls in place is vital, and regular testing ensures the controls work as expected.

For often-targeted organizations, we recommend implementing more compensating controls and considering these incidents when evaluating organizational risk. The type and frequency of incidents can provide a powerful argument in requesting funding for additional security controls—especially when well-documented with regular benchmarking and metrics. Specifically, this information can feed directly into risk assessments, which illustrate the potential impact to the organization.

## Adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM)

Last year, we noted that threat actors had begun transitioning to AiTM techniques, and we watched use of this tactic grow considerably throughout 2023. AiTM allows threat actors to bypass some forms of MFA, acquire user credentials or session cookies, and gain access by intercepting authentication traffic.

Here’s how a typical AiTM attack plays out:

1.  An employee receives a phishing email with a malicious link or attachment leading to an attacker-controlled website, which acts as a proxy for the genuine website.
2.  Employees submit their credentials and, after prompting, provide an MFA challenge answer.
3.  The attacker proxy relays the requests and responses back and forth between the employee and the genuine site.
4.  The attacker-controlled proxy seamlessly intercepts the session cookie and redirects the employee to the application the cookie was set up with.
5.  Attackers import the session token cookies into their web browser and authenticate, bypassing MFA. Now, the attacker can use the victim’s session.

**Diagram of an AiTM attack**

*A diagram illustrating the steps of an AiTM attack. It shows an employee receiving a phishing email, submitting credentials to a fake website, the attacker intercepting the traffic, and the attacker using the user's session cookie.*

### How to protect your organization from AiTM attacks

After a successful attack, organizations must not only reset passwords but also terminate sessions for that user; while the session is still active, the attacker can continue to access the account. In most situations, attackers will attempt to register an MFA device while they have access to the account. We recommend investigating to identify newly registered MFA devices after an account compromise.

Some technology, such as Fast Identity Online 2 (FIDO2) and certificate-based authentication, can stop AiTM attacks. But most organizations haven’t quite made the jump to FIDO-only MFA factors—many still use time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) and push notifications for MFA. While these features raise the bar considerably, gaps remain and AiTM attacks will continue to exploit them. If FIDO2 isn’t feasible, consider using other access controls, such as requiring authentication from approved devices.

PhaaS platforms have also fed the growth of AiTM, so we don’t see these attacks slowing down in 2024. We recommend ensuring your organization automatically terminates sessions and reviews activity performed by an identity-compromised account.

What can you do to detect—and hopefully prevent—these costly attacks? Here’s what we recommend for security teams:

*   Alert on a user logging in from two different locations. Due to proxying, successful AiTM results in multiple login events—one by the user and one by the attacker. Alert for multiple sessions from the same user with multiple non-mobile operating systems. This is an indicator that something suspicious is under way.
*   Alert for potential brute-force push requests.
*   Review events marked by end-users as suspicious.

We recommend creating detections for as many stages of a possible incident as is feasible to decrease the possibility of an attack going unnoticed. Examples include:

*   Alert on newly added MFA devices.
    *   Improve the rate of false positives by tuning out expected network zones.
*   Alert for new Outlook inbox rules created with suspicious names. Names that are two to three characters in length, or that contain repeating characters, are generally suspicious.
    *   Also watch out for certain keywords, like “payroll,” “malware,” or “virus.”
*   Advise employees to be aware of their information in the payroll system and report any abnormal or suspicious activity to the security team
