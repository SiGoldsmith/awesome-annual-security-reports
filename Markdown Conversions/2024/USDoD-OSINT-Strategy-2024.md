Defense OSINT Strategy 2024–2028.

## Foreword
In 3 decades since the creation of the first website, the Internet has grown to well over one billion sites. 
Four and a half billion users access 200 million active websites every day. The global digital data 
environment doubles in size every 2 years. Technology-enabled devices track and monetize all aspects of 
the human experience. Within the U.S. Government, Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) has evolved 
substantially since the establishment of the Open Source Center (OSC) in 2005. The fast pace of the 
ongoing technology revolution poses significant challenges for a growing community of collection activities 
across the Defense Intelligence Enterprise (DIE).

In 2012, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) published the first U.S. DoD OSINT strategy. Since then, 
DoD OSINT has proven its unique value as a primary source of intelligence during multiple crisis 
situations.

This strategy will strengthen the DoD OSINT community and enable a true enterprise approach oriented 
squarely on the intelligence challenges posed by strategic competition. The central idea is to drive up the 
intelligence value of OSINT by unifying collection and reporting, integrating advanced technologies, and 
professionalizing the workforce.

Operating on behalf of the Director, DIA, as the Defense Intelligence Enterprise Manager (DIEM) for 
OSINT, the Defense Open Source Council (DOSC) will collaborate to set standards, track progress, and 
synchronize activities. We call on all Defense Intelligence Enterprise components to rise to the challenges 
ahead to fulfill our vision of OSINT as the “first resort” source of intelligence for decision makers and 
warfighters.

## Administration
This strategy updates and replaces the 2012–2017 
DoD OSINT Strategy. It applies to Department of 
Defense components at all echelons or 
organizational levels that have OSINT programs 
and activities.

The goals, objectives, and underlying 
methodologies for strengthening OSINT are widely 
applicable to all foreign partner engagements.

The requirement for a DoD OSINT strategy is 
established in Department of Defense Instruction 
3115.12, Open Source Intelligence, which also 
establishes the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) 
as the lead component for OSINT. In December 
2021, the Under Secretary of Defense for 
Intelligence & Security further designated the 
Director, DIA as the Defense Intelligence 
Enterprise Manager (DIEM) for OSINT. The 
DIEM-OSINT designation was codified as 
department policy in DoD Directive 5105.21 by 
the Deputy Secretary of Defense on January 25, 
2023.

DIA is also tasked to lead the Defense Open Source 
Council (DOSC), defined in policy as the primary 
governance mechanism for DoD OSINT. Among 
the list of DOSC responsibilities is the task to 
establish an OSINT strategy.

The Director, DIA, tasked the Open Source 
Intelligence Integration Center (OSIC) to lead 
execution of the Agency’s DOSC and DIEM 
responsibilities. The Chief, OSIC also serves Chair 
of the DOSC, and provides primary staff secretariat 
support that drives the DOSC agenda.

OSINT Governance Overview

The DOSC advises and reports to the DIEM-
OSINT and the DIE OSINT Board of Governors 
(BoG) on issues, performance metrics, and 
resource recommendations; and identifies matters 
for BoG decision and direction.

The OSINT BoG assesses and prioritizes Defense 
OSINT activities and capabilities, integrates OSINT 
Community perspectives, and promotes a unified 
approach to Defense OSINT. The DIEM for 
OSINT may convene a Defense OSINT Executive 
Committee (EXCOM) to address specific issues 
that do not require the attention of the BoG.

All DoD components with OSINT programs 
provide representation to the DOSC. DOSC 
members represent their components and serve 
as a two-way conduit of information for 
developing and disseminating OSINT guidelines, 
standards, and procedures.

The DOSC is the primary governance body for 
Defense OSINT, and serves as a forum for 
coordination and facilitation of Defense OSINT 
activities and programs at the working and action 
officer levels.

Defense OSINT Strategy 2024–2028 

## Executive Summary
Much has changed since publication of the last 
OSINT strategy in 2012, which coincided with a 
surge in mobile device sales and social media plat-
form users that reshaped the open source landscape.

The conditions were set for the digital revolution 
that continues today. In 2012, the newest smart 
phone could store 64GB of data — it would take 
234 of these to store the data produced by a single 
person each day in 2023, and this number will 
double in 2 years.

Against this backdrop, the challenges ahead for 
Defense OSINT are daunting. The good news is 
the Defense Intelligence Enterprise has spent the 
past 10 years ramping up Open Source 
capabilities. The Defense Intelligence Agency, 
designated in 2021 as the Defense Intelligence 
Enterprise Manager for OSINT, through the Open 
Source Intelligence Integration Center (OSIC), 
leads a robust Defense Open Source Council 
(DOSC) to coordinate and synchronize OSINT 
across the Department.

This strategy establishes a vision, goals, and 
objectives to elevate OSINT as a core intelligence 
discipline that provides high-value unclassified 
reporting, while simultaneously serving as a 
catalyst for enriched all source analysis and a 
valuable cueing mechanism for the other 
intelligence arts. To do this, the DOSC will lead 
enterprise-level initiatives designed to increase the 
intelligence value of OSINT reporting, integrate 
new technologies, improve data management, and 
maximize sharing of collected data and 
information. Through a fully-federated, system for 
synchronizing tasking, collection, processing, 
exploitation, and dissemination, DOSC member 
organizations will collaborate to optimize their 
OSINT activities from end to end, eliminating 
redundancy and duplication of effort. Adherence 
to four Guiding Principles — Data Centricity, 
Diversified Collection, Dispersed Operations, 
Distributed Enterprise — will serve as anchor 
points as the enterprise drives towards this vision.

The operating environment will continue to evolve 
into a common competitive space for discovery, 
posing new challenges and opportunities for 
Defense OSINT.

Artificial intelligence will provide unprecedented 
capability to sift through vast quantities of data 
extract concepts in their entirety. It will 
simultaneously enable rapid creation of false 
information that will call into question the validity 
of all data collected from open sources. Social 
media platforms will continue to serve as hubs for 
people with shared interests, but the proliferation 
of spam accounts could push many web platforms 
towards invitation-only policies. Changes in 
privacy laws and digital security procedures will 
also limit access to information that is readily 
available today.

Although technology advancements are a key 
feature of this strategy, people will continue to be 
our greatest asset. Investing in a highly trained 
workforce is the key to long-term success and 
securing the future of Defense OSINT. External 
engagements are an equally important force 
multiplier. The DOSC will expand collaboration 
with the commercial sector, government think 
tanks, and academic experts to anticipate open 
source challenges and opportunities.

Internationally, the DOSC will forge new 
collaboration pathways with foreign allies and 
partners to establish a globally-postured OSINT 
collection and reporting platform.

## Open Source Challenges and Opportunities
![Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices worldwide from 2019 to 2021 with forecasts from 2022 to 2030 (in billions).]

In an era of Strategic Competition, Open Source 
Intelligence (OSINT) derives insights, produces 
actionable intelligence, enables timely and effective 
public messaging and international engagements, and 
provides leaders with timely options for developing 
strategic communications. 

In the open source operating environment, change is 
the only constant. A prime example is the 
emergence of large quantities of data as an open-
market commodity, which has created new 
opportunities for OSINT collection and exploitation. 
Since 2018, the total value of data bought and sold 
on the global economy surpassed that of crude oil.

Technological advances, changing societal norms, 
and revised data privacy regulations will continue to 
create challenges, and the OSINT community must
adapt to gain and maintain information dominance. 
The Internet of Things will track every aspect of 
personal information including health, fitness, 
entertainment, temperature control, lighting, and 
home security systems. Smart cities will integrate 
traffic management, intelligent connected vehicles, 
public safety, intelligent shopping, and energy 
efficiency technologies. 

Social media messaging platforms, online 
collaboration sites, and mobile applications will 
continue to serve as hubs for people with shared 
interests. The proliferation of spam accounts, 
offensive content, and false information could push 
many web platforms towards invitation-only, 
rendering these services inaccessible under current 
OSINT policies and authorities. Changes in 
international privacy laws, expanded government 
regulation of digital platforms, data governance, 
and digital security will limit access to and use of 
information that is readily available today.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)
> Leveraging the power of AI to sharp-en 
our intelligence insights and illumi-nate 
opportunities is critical to our future 
success. Our adversaries understand the 
significance of mastering advanced tech-
nologies to undercut our strategic and 
tactical dominance.
—DIA AI Strategy

Artificial intelligence tools and capabilities 
represent a double-edged sword for the OSINT 
community. They provide unprecedented 
capability to sift through vast quantities of data, 
while simultaneously enabling rapid creation of 
false information. However, artificial intelligence 
(AI) fundamentally changes the impact of OSINT.

Building algorithms to associate disparate data 
points will enable the extraction of entire concepts  
from the open source environment. Generative 
AI, in the hands of nefarious actors, has potential to 
create digital media content that will call into 
question the validity of all data collected in in the 
global open source environment, requiring trained 
OSINT professionals and robust analysis to validate 
collected information. 

OSINT must evolve to establish and maintain a 
competitive advantage in the volatile open source 
operating environment of the future. OSINT is an 
intelligence collection discipline infused with 
technical skills, enhanced digital literacy, and 
advanced tradecraft.

It requires heavy investment in data science, 
stewardship and continued human-machine integration 
throughout the intelligence cycle. Adopting an 
enterprise-wide, data-centric approach to OSINT 
places increased emphasis on the importance of life-
cycle management principles. Discovery of existing 
data collections at the front end avoids duplication of 
collection efforts or repeat acquisitions of costly 
commercially available information, too
ols, and services. 

Through a modernized OSINT requirements 
management system, DOSC members will have 
automated access to centralized data storage 
re
repositories with secure, cross domain accessibility.

The OSINT center of gravity resides in human 
operators, and not in any machine or tool. Machine-
based collection and processing will augment highly 
skilled human operators orchestrating compilation of 
multiple streams of open source information to create 
high-value intelligence reports, cross-cue other 
collection platforms, and feed the all source analysis 
process. Simple, single-source OSINT reporting will 
increasingly be addressed by machines at scale freeing 
open source teams to focus on more complex collection 
methods. Likewise, the teaming of machine translation 
and native-speaker human collectors will remain an 
essential ingredient of OSINT success, especially 
pertaining to real-time understanding of social media 
content and sentiment heavily laced with local dialect, 
cultural nuances, and idiomatic expressions unique to 
online digital life. Trained and empowered open source 
officers will lead integration of requirements managers, 
online collectors, data scientists, librarians, acquisition 
and contracts specialists, and privacy/civil liberties 
officers operating as a multi-discipline team. Together 
they will unlock global information and harvest the 
intelligence value of open source data.

Novel sources of information stemming from the 
commercial data marketplace will present new 
opportunities for the OSINT community to 
diversify collection and acquisition and hedge 
against over-dependency on a limited number of 
social media and data providers.

Competition for relevance in the crowded digital 
data ecosystem — the pursuit of being the “next-
big thing” — necessitates an agile OSINT 
collection posture that is not overly-dependent 
on a specific social media outlet or data provider.

Third-party data brokers, industry partners, and 
academia with persistent global reach can provide 
expertise, access, and agility far outpacing what the 
government can create, scale, and sustain. OSINT 
will provide secure and efficient pathways for 
locating, assessing, collecting, and accessing these 
data sources, while adhering to the highest 
standards for protecting sensitive and personal 
information that is increasingly available on the 
commercial data market.

Effective ties and unity of effort between OSINT 
and the other intelligence disciplines will increase 
in importance as the scale and scope of open source

increases. OSINT informs a wide range of 
classified intelligence and intelligence-related 
planning and operational activities. Focused 
collection of open source data and information will 
facilitate operations security (OPSEC) and protect 
sensitive intelligence operations. Technical 
exploitation of the expanding universe of Internet-
connected devices will require greater 
collaboration between the technical collection 
disciplines. Persistent global positioning 
technologies will provide endless possibilities for 
expanded collaboration between OSINT and other 
intelligence disciplines.

The demands on OSINT will inevitably continue to 
outpace the growth of capabilities within the 
individual DIE components. The path to success is a 
fully integrated enterprise approach to all open 
source activities and programs across the DIE, 
whether conducted for OSINT, or to support a wide 
range of intelligence requirements. 

The DOSC, under direction of the DIEM-OSINT, 
will adapt and evolve to lead these efforts and serve 
as the central point of collaboration in the highly 
complex and always-evolving open source operating 
environment of the future.

Defense OSINT Strategy 2024–2028

## Strategic Goals and Enabling Objectives
> VISION
> Make OSINT the 
> “first resort” source 
> of intelligence for 
> decisionmakers and 
> warfighters.

### Strategic Goal 1: Enhance decisionmaker and warfighter situational awareness through timely delivery of customized, serialized OSINT products and data
Enabling Objective 1.1— Integrate advanced 
technologies for collecting, processing, and 
reporting OSINT. Maintaining an accurate 
understanding of global events, especially in the 
early stages of emerging crisis situations, is 
increasingly difficult for warfighters and decision-
makers. Rapid assimilation of open source 
information across multiple data streams requires 
effective use of artificial intelligence and machine 
learning (AI/ML) capabilities to enhance, expand, 
and accelerate OSINT collection activities across 
the DIE. Prioritization of associative sensemaking 
will enable the extraction of concepts from the 
open source environment. 

Enabling Objective 1.2 — Expand and enrich 
OSINT reporting and adopt new product lines 
tailored to unique requirements for unclassified 
decision aids and strategic messaging. 
Communicating to global audiences in the 
information environment is an essential element of 
integrated deterrence, which is a centerpiece of 
our National Defense Strategies. Timely, precise, 
and in-depth OSINT reporting enables leaders to 
outpace adversarial narratives, and is essential to 
the formulation of strategic messaging and pro-
active engagement with partners, allies, and the 
public at large.

Enabling Objective 1.3 — Develop and Deploy an 
Open Source, Cross-Domain, Tasking, Collection, 
Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TC-
PED) system accessible to the Defense 
Intelligence Enterprise, FVEYs and IC partners. 
OSINT is unique as an intelligence discipline in that it 
supports all other forms of intelligence. OSINT 
provides broad insights for shaping collection plans, 
tips, and cues other collection capabilities, and fills 
gaps to round out all source analysis. To fulfill the 
role as the DIE’s first stop on any new intelligence 
endeavor, the DOSC must work together to develop 
and adopt a fully functioning TC-PED architecture 
for OSINT, accessible to authorized US and Coalition 
users at all classification levels across multiple 
networks, that orchestrates collection, ensures full 
access to all open source data and reporting, provides 
data enrichment microservices, integrates seamlessly 
with all source analysis, and populates catalogs and 
repositories.

### Strategic Goal 2: Maximize the intelligence value of open source information
Enabling Objective 2.1 — Attain and maintain 
an OSINT technology advantage. The open 
source information space is a highly dynamic 
operating environment fueled by novel, technology-
based approaches to support a wide range of 
government and private-sector business 
requirements. Beyond their commercial value, 
these capabilities have game-changing potential for 
transforming vast quantities of open source 
information into valuable Defense intelligence, at 
the speed and scale required to keep pace with 
warfighter and decision-maker demands for OSINT.

Enabling Objective 2.2 — Optimize sharing of 
OSINT-related technologies across the DIE. 
Developing, acquiring, and gaining approval to deploy 
new technologies on DoD networks is a complex, 
time consuming process. Sharing technology 
solutions across the enterprise mitigates opportunity 
costs and promotes increased collaboration; all 
resulting in greater efficiency, preservation or 
resources, and enhanced mission focus.

Enabling Objective 2.3 — Develop hybrid, multi-
discipline solutions for scalable OSINT collection 
and processing teams. The open source data 
environment will become increasingly challenging for 
OSINT collectors, necessitating novel approaches for 
collection of open source information, and processing 
it into high value intelligence products. 

Enabling Objective 2.4 — Establish assessment 
and evaluation criteria and standards to measure 
performance and effectiveness of OSINT collection 
and reporting. It is critical for the DIE to measure 
the performance and effectiveness of OSINT 
collection and reporting.

### Strategic Goal 3: Expand the open source aperture internally and externally
Enabling Objective 3.1 — Improve 
collaboration with other Intelligence 
disciplines. OSINT provides situational awareness 
and foundational collection that enables other 
intelligence disciplines to focus their capabilities on 
the hardest targets and requirements that can be 
answered by no other means. A sudden increase in 
social media postings can be the first indicator of an 
emerging crisis, and a starting point for other 
focused collection. Publicly shared images can 
provide location data or other relevant information 
that can be used to inform other collection efforts.

Enabling Objective 3.2 — Open new pathways 
and develop novel procedures for acquiring 
Open Source data and information. The online 
open source environment is constantly evolving.
Sustaining access, locating unique data sources, and 
extracting information with intelligence value from 
a network of more than 200 million nodes hosting 4 
billion users every day is a complex set of activities. 
Machine association of disparate data points will enable 
analysts and leaders to identify the ontology of threats, 
make sense of the information environment, and 
extract whole concepts from the open source domain. 
To succeed, the DOSC must identify and execute a 
diversified collection posture that mitigates 
dependency on single sources of data or information. 
Across the DIE, open source data governance will 
apply the core principles for ensuring data is visible, 
accessible, understandable, linked, trustworthy, 
interoperable, and secure (VAULTIS) in accordance 
with the DoD Data Strategy.

Enabling Objective 3.3 — Close the gaps that 
impede full OSINT collaboration. Global strategic 
competition, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, 
requires the utmost degree of collaboration. To 
accelerate expanded OSINT collaboration, DOSC 
components will develop options to improve 
partnership and interoperability, such as forward-based 
OSINT platforms, and leverage these opportunities to 
promote more effective international partnerships 
among all DOSC members.

Enabling Objective 3.4 — Establish bilateral and 
multilateral OSINT partnerships in priority 
geographic regions to open new collection 
pathways and expand intelligence collaboration 
with foreign partners. OSINT is less encumbered 
than other intelligence disciplines by limitations in 
sharing classified information. For these and other 
reasons, OSINT provides unique opportunities to 
engage more freely and openly with our foreign 
security partners. Many of these partners have unique 
insights, access, and understanding of regional issues, 
and in some cases a high density of native language 
expertise.

### Strategic Goal 4: Establish OSINT as a premier intelligence capability and the foundation for all other disciplines
Enabling Objective 4.1 — Create and 
institutionalize OSINT Training, Tradecraft, 
and Civilian/Military career pathways. The 
complex open source environment requires unique 
skills and abilities that are not resident in existing 
civilian and military career tracks. To 
professionalize the OSINT workforce, the DOSC 
will identify training and certification standards, 
determine core and essential tasks, and facilitate 
development, implementation, and sustainment of 
common training courses. Where possible, these 
will include options for in-person or online 
attendance through DIE training portals, not only 
for OSINT practitioners but also leaders and 
managers across the DIE. 

Enabling Objective 4.2 — Strengthen OSINT 
governance. The decentralized nature of OSINT 
collection activity across the DIE has enabled highly 
impressive development of capabilities, programs, 
tools, and procedures at the component level.

Enabling Objective 4.3 — Expand and enrich 
engagement within respective US and FVEY 
policy and oversight regimes. Ongoing and recent 
deliberations on the ideal OSINT governance model 
highlight the fact that no single department or 
agency is ideally positioned to lead OSINT at the 
national level. New organizational constructs, 
international agreements, and changing public 
sensitivities regarding data privacy will have 
profound effects on Defense OSINT organizations.

Enabling Objective 4.4 — Improve awareness 
and understanding of OSINT across all 
Defense, federal government, private sector, 
and public audiences. OSINT needs to take a 
more deliberate approach to educating and 
informing all audiences on its capabilities and 
limitations, and be forthright regarding successes 
and failures.

### Strategic Goal 5: Synchronize OSINT with all other Publicly and Commercially Available Information (PAI/CAI) activities
Enabling Objective 5.1 — Integrate Multi-Int 
Collection Management. In the open source 
domain, data-centricity encompasses all collection 
of PAI/CAI, not just for OSINT purposes, 
regardless of its end use by other intelligence 
disciplines. 

Enabling Objective 5.2 — Develop an 
Enterprise Data and Tool Assessment, 
Acquisition, and Discovery Framework. Diverse 
procedures for acquiring commercial data and tools 
increases the risks of poor data quality, malicious 
code, and low return on investment across the DIE.
