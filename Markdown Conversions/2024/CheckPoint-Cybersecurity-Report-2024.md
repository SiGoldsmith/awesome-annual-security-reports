CHECK POINT SOFTWARE  |  SECURITY REPORT 2024

Welcome to the Check Point 2024 Cyber Security Report. In 2023, the world of cyber 
security witnessed significant changes, with the nature and scale of cyber attacks 
evolving rapidly. This year, we saw cyber threats stepping out from the shadows of the 
online world into the spotlight, grabbing the attention of everyone from government 
agencies to the general public. 

The reasons behind these attacks have become as varied as the methods used. 
Ransomware remained a major threat, with attackers not just after money, but also 
seeking recognition. Ransomware attacks exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities while 
using shame sites for publicly revealing who their victims are became more popular, 
turning ransomware into a sort of competition among cybercriminals. The cost of  
these attacks went beyond just paying the ransom, with companies like MGM, DP World, 
and the British Library facing huge expenses to rebuild their systems.

We also saw an increase in hacktivism, where hackers are driven by political or social 
causes. This type of hacking, once a tool for individual activists, is now being used by 
governments as a way to attack adversaries indirectly. This was especially noticeable  
in the wake of events like the Russo-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict.

Attackers found new ways to break into systems, with devices like routers and switches 
becoming easy targets. Big organizations, including Okta and 23AndMe, were hit by 
attacks that used stolen login details or malicious software.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) played a bigger role in cyber attacks this year. Attackers 
started using AI tools to make their phishing campaigns more effective. However, the 
good news is that AI is also being used by cyber defenders to better protect against 
these threats.

There were some wins against cybercriminals too. Law enforcement agencies, including 
the FBI, made progress in taking down major threats like the Hive Ransomware network 
and the Qbot infrastructure. But the comeback of some of these groups reminds us that 
the fight against cybercrime is ongoing.

This report looks back at the major cyber security events of 2023, offering insights and 
analysis to help understand and prepare for the challenges ahead. Our goal is to provide 
valuable information to organizations, policy makers, and cyber security professionals, 
helping them to build stronger defenses in an increasingly digital world.

We hope you find this report informative and useful in your efforts to keep your digital 
environments secure.

JANUARY
*   A database containing over 14 million usernames and passwords was found on a dark  
web forum, and within this database were more than 100,000 logins for portals belonging 
to Australian government agencies.
*   The Vice Society ransomware group has been conducting a series of widespread attacks  
targeting schools in both the United Kingdom and the United States. In response to  
these developments, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has issued an official  
alert regarding the group’s activities.
    *   Check Point Threat Emulation provides protection against this  
        threat (Trojan.Wins.ViceSociety.*)
*   Check Point Research reports that threat actors in hacking forums have started making 
use of AI tools like ChatGPT, in order to create malware and attack tools such as  
info-stealers and encryptors.
*   Britain’s international mail service, Royal Mail, has had its operations disrupted by a  
cyberattack. The service has instructed its users not to post mail, as it is unable to  
dispatch packages to their destinations. The LockBit ransomware gang has been confirmed 
as the perpetrator of the attack, and is threatening to leak stolen data if its ransom  
demand is not met.
    *   Check Point Harmony Endpoint and Threat Emulation provide  
        protection against this threat (Ransomware.Win.Lockbit)
*   Check Point Research is seeing attempts by Russian cybercriminals to bypass OpenAI’s  
restrictions, to use ChatGPT for malicious purposes. In underground hacking forums,  
hackers are discussing how to circumvent IP addresses, payment cards and phone  
numbers controls—all of which are needed to gain access to ChatGPT from Russia.

FEBRUARY
*   Check Point Research has flagged the Dingo crypto Token, with a market cap of $10,941,525  
as a scam. The threat actors behind the token added a backdoor function in its smart  
contract, to manipulate the fee. Specifically, they used the “setTaxFeePercent” function 
within the token’s smart contract code to manipulate the buying and selling fees to an 
alarming 99%. The function has already been used 47 times, and investors of Dingo Token 
can potentially risk losing all their funds.
*   KillNet, a pro-Russian hacktivists group, has launched a wide scale operation against  
the US healthcare sector with multiple DDoS attacks.
*   JD Sports, UK sportswear retailer, has announced a data breach that affected approximately 
10M clients. The alleged leaked data consists of clients’ online orders placed between  
November 2018 and October 2020, including full names, emails, phone numbers, billing  
details, delivery addresses, and more.
*   Check Point Research exposed two malicious code packages, Python-drgn and Bloxflip,  
distributed by threat actors, leveraging package repositories as a reliable and scalable  
malware distribution channel.
*   The group behind the massive ‘ESXiArgs’ ransomware campaign, which affected thousands  
of VMware ESXi hosts, has updated their malware’s encryption process. The updated 
version of the malware prevents the potential recovery method that was recommended 
by researchers, as it now also encrypts the files that could have been used to trigger the 
recovery process.
    *   Check Point IPS provides protection against this threat (VMWare 
        OpenSLP Heap Buffer Overflow (CVE-2019-5544; CVE-2021-21974))

attempts through websites that appear to be related to ChatGPT, to lure users into  
downloading malicious files or disclose sensitive information.
*   The data storage giant Western Digital has confirmed a data breach that exposed the  
personal information of the company’s clients. The leaked data includes names, billing  
and shipping addresses, email address and phone numbers. The threat actors claimed  
they are not affiliated with the ALPHV (aka Black Cat) ransomware gang but would use  
that group’s leak site to threaten and extort the company.
*   Check Point Research had discovered a custom firmware implant tailored for TP-Link  
routers that has been linked to a Chinese state-sponsored APT group tracked as  
Camaro Dragon, which shares similarities with Mustang Panda. The implant was used  
in targeted attacks aimed at European foreign affairs entities, and it features several  
malicious components. This includes a custom backdoor named “Horse Shell”, which  
enables the attackers to maintain persistent access, build anonymous infrastructure  
and enable lateral movement into compromised networks.

    *   Check Point Quantum IoT Protect and Threat Emulation provide  
        protection against this threat (APT.Wins.HorseShell)
*   The FBI, CISA, and ACSC warn that the BianLian ransomware group has shifted its tactics to 
extortion-only attacks. Instead of encrypting files and demanding a ransom, the group now 
focuses on stealing sensitive data and threatening to release it unless a payment is made.
    *   Check Point Threat Emulation provides protection against this threat 
        (Ransomware.Win.GenRansom.glsf.A)
*   Check Point Research has published a report on GuLoader—a prominent shellcode-based 
downloader that has been used in a large number of attacks to deliver a wide range of the 
“most wanted” malware. GuLoader’s payload is fully encrypted, what allows threat actors to 
store payloads using well-known public cloud services, and bypass antivirus protections.
    *   Check Point Threat Emulation provides protection against this threat 
        (Dropper.Win.CloudEyE.*)
*   Check Point Research elaborates on the latest Chinese state sponsored attacks and their 
use of network devices. This follows a joint Cybersecurity Advisory that United States and 
international cybersecurity authorities issued on Chinese state-sponsored cyber actor,  
also known as Volt Typhoon. This actor have compromised “critical” cyber infrastructure  
in a variety of industries, including governmental and communications organizations.
 
 
JUNE
*   Progress disclosed a vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer and MOVEit Cloud (CVE-2023-34362) 
that could lead to escalated privileges and potential unauthorized access to the environment. 
Upon discovery, Progress launched an investigation, provided mitigation steps and released a 
security patch, all within 48 hours. Unfortunately, during that time, cybercriminals associated 
with Russian-affiliated ransomware group Clop exploited the vulnerability and launched a 
supply chain attack against MOVEit users. Among them was payroll services provider Zellis, 
who was the first to disclose a security breach, although many others have been impacted.

        (MOVEit Transfer SQL Injection (CVE-2023-34362))
*   Check Point Research has published an analysis of a backdoor tool used by the Chinese 
APT group Camaro Dragon. The backdoor tool, dubbed TinyNote, is written in Go and 
includes a feature bypassing Indonesian antivirus software SmadAV, which is popular in 
Southeast Asian countries. The APT group’s victims likely include embassies in Southeast 
Asian countries.
    *   Check Point Threat Emulation provides protection against this threat 
        (APT.Wins.MustangPanda.ta.*)
*   An Illinois hospital faced closure as a result of a ransomware attack, making it the first 
healthcare facility to shut down due to such an incident. The attack on SMP Health in  
2021 disrupted the hospital's capability to submit claims to insurers, including Medicare 
and Medicaid, for several months. This situation led to a severe financial downturn for  
the hospital. 
*   The Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles (OMV) and the Oregon DMV Services have released 
statements warning US citizens of a data breach exposing millions of driver’s licenses.  
This comes after the Clop ransomware gang had hacked the agencies’ MOVEit Transfer 
security file transfer systems and stole the stored data.
    *   Check Point IPS blade, Harmony Endpoint and Threat Emulation  
        provide protection against this threat ((Progress MOVEit Transfer  
        Multiple Vulnerabilities); Webshell.Win.Moveit, Ransomware.Win.
        Clop, Ransomware_Linux_Clop; Exploit.Wins.MOVEit)
*   Check Point researchers have discovered a sophisticated malware affecting a European 
medical institution. The attack is attributed to Camaro Dragon (Mustang Panda), a Chinese 
state-sponsored APT group. The threat actors employ malicious USB drives as an initial  
access vector in order to target restricted networks, and their payload includes a module  
that further infects any additional USB drive that is plugged into an infected host. It is  
believed that the malware thus propagated beyond the attackers’ initial intent, likely  
inadvertently infecting dozens of organizations worldwide.

The websites will then prompt the victims to input their credentials and thus to steal them.
    *   Check Point Harmony Email provides protection against this threat.
*   Check Point researchers have analyzed the potential impact of the emerging generative 
AI technology on election influencing operations. Generative AI is capable of constructing 
individually tailored audio-visual propaganda to target voters on a massive scale, causing 
a heightened risk to democratic election integrity. To combat the issue, Google will require 
disclosure on political advertisements involving AI.
*   The American resort, casino and hotel chain MGM has suffered a cyber-attack that  
resulted in widespread disruption across the company’s hotels and casinos, and has shut 
down its internal networks as a precaution. The cyber-attack paralyzed the company’s 
ATMs, slot machines, room digital key cards and electronic payment systems. ALPHV
