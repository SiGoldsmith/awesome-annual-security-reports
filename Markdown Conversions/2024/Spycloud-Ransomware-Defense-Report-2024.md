IN COLLABORATION WITH
By the year 2024, the computer had become the central force of the workplace. Long gone were 
the days of the typewriter, ﬁling cabinets, and notepads – and in their place, every ofﬁce worker 
had become a machine of one, powered by their device, speeding through each eight-hour day on 
a keyboard and furiously clicking in the name of Productivity. 
With the surge in global computer use came the creation of a new role within the modern 
organization – the security operations center (SOC). Given the difﬁcult task of safeguarding the 
productive relationship between people and machines, the SOC quickly realized the daunting 
challenges they were up against. Rampant password reuse, burgeoning digital users, and the rise 
of crafty cybercriminals threatened their organizations at every turn. 
And as the world and workplace continued to develop, the challenges only grew – from 
high-volume data leaks to stealthy infostealer malware, stolen session cookies, and proﬁt-hungry 
ransomware gangs. The SOC gathered what tools they could find, and together with their fellow 
Defenders gave an admirable attempt at leveling the ﬁght between themselves and the enemies 
that threatened Productivity – enemies that were shapeshifting and multiplying before their eyes. 
Would it be enough?

## SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS
Every year, improving ransomware prevention capabilities is one of the top priorities for organizations 
in the immediate future. Even with focused efforts, the risk of the ransomware threat remains high – 
survey respondents rank ransomware as their biggest threat among eight categories. 
The survey data validates security teams’ concerns, with 75% of organizations reporting being 
affected[^1] by ransomware more than once in the past 12 months – a jump from 61% last year. 
Nearly 100% of the surveyed organizations are concerned about the potential for identity, session cookie, and other data 
siphoned from malware-infected devices being used to enable follow-on attacks like ransomware. But some good news 
– respondents’ second biggest priority for the next 12-18 months is to improve visibility and remediation for
compromised credentials and malware-exﬁltrated data.
For organizations who reported being affected by ransomware in the past year, stolen cookies that enabled session 
hijacking ranked as the third most common entry point for ransomware attempts and successful attacks, 
following phishing/social engineering and third-party access. 
More than half (57.5%) of teams report that they routinely invalidate or terminate open sessions for applications in 
response to a managed device getting infected with malware, which shows heightened awareness of the growing 
session hijacking problem. 
Nearly all surveyed organizations are concerned about the risks from third-party accounts being 
compromised due to malware infections – and 82% are either extremely or signiﬁcantly concerned. 
Additionally, participants rank third-party access as the second most common entry point for 
ransomware.

[^1]: ‘Affected’ in this context means teams allocated resources to address ransomware attempts and/or full-blown attacks.

KEY FINDINGS BY ROLE AND INDUSTRY
CIOs, CISOs, and other IT security executives are much more conﬁdent about their organization’s ability to 
prevent a full-blown ransomware attack – 91% of leaders are generally conﬁdent, compared to 54% of 
security operators, analysts, and incident responders, and 71% of access and identity management 
professionals. Likewise, leaders express much higher conﬁdence in their organization’s malware and 
ransomware response capabilities. This difference in perception reﬂects a disconnect when it comes to 
shared understanding of an organization’s cybersecurity posture. 
Identity and access management (IAM) directors, managers, and team leads are the cohort most concerned about 
exposure from malware-infected devices and compromised or infected third-party accounts. Case in point, 95% are 
extremely or signiﬁcantly concerned about data siphoned from malware-infected devices being used for more 
harmful attacks, vs. 83% of security directors, managers, and team leads, and vs. 69% of analysts and incident 
responders. Additionally, IAM professionals are more concerned about risks to their organization from third-party 
accounts compromised by malware infections, and are also more likely to name stolen cookies as one of the riskiest 
ransomware entry points.
Survey respondents from each sector rank ransomware as the biggest threat to their organization. 
However, only three sectors – manufacturing, retail, and technology – rate improved ransomware 
prevention capabilities among their two main priorities in the next 12 to 18 months. Technology and 
manufacturing also express the highest concern for compromised third-party accounts. Interestingly, 
retail respondents rank their ability to identify business applications exposed by a malware infection 
as their organization’s top capability.

## THE MALWARE AND RANSOMWARE
RESURGENCE  .
After a brief decline in activity in late 2022, ransomware 
re-emerged with a vengeance over the last 18 months. 
Like a villain with endless lives, ransomware actors not only 
refused to give up, they’ve had an unprecedented run...

CHECKPOINT
IBM security researchers reported a
266% upsurge in the use of
infostealers by groups that
specialize in ransomware. 
They also noted signs of “continued
investment in infostealer innovation.”

Ransomware payments soared past $1 billion in 2023 while the volume, frequency, scope of attacks, and number 
of new players spiked as well, ranging from solo actors and small groups to powerful syndicates with robust 
afﬁliate business models. 
Collectively, these actors continuously wreaked havoc across sectors. In the past 12 months, they:
- Disrupted the operations of thousands of automotive dealerships for days
- Caused $100 million in ﬁnancial losses to a major hotel and casino chain
- Forced the ninth-largest US city to close court hearings and other services for weeks
- Stole 6TB worth of data belonging to as many as one-third of American consumers – including identity and 
health information – and caused widespread outages across the healthcare ecosystem
These are just a few examples of the destructive power that ransomware wields over organizations. The losses 
from this destruction can be immense  – the average cost of a ransomware attack is now $4.91 million.
The resurgence of ransomware comes at a time when another big shift is taking place. Cybercriminals have 
pivoted to next-generation tactics, using information-stealing malware (or “infostealers”) to siphon credentials, 
session cookies, and identity data from infected users and selling this information to ransomware operators.
At SpyCloud, we have continuously tracked the ongoing rise of the infostealer trend and its impact on follow-on 
attacks like ransomware. Combined with a similarly explosive growth in digital identity exposure in the past few 
years, these two trends are fueling a perfect storm for ransomware crimes.

Here are just a few of the 
components that remove the 
barrier to entry into cybercrime for 
aspiring and seasoned players 
alike:
- **MALWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (MaaS)**
This off-the-shelf model for a variety of 
malware, and especially infostealers, 
enables even low-skilled cybercriminals to 
steal fresh and accurate identity data in bulk, 
including login credentials, session cookies, 
and device details – basically everything 
needed to impersonate an identity.
- **INSTALL BROKERS**
Also known as ad brokers, install services, 
and pay-per-install (PPI) services, these 
specialists offer a network of websites and 
advertisements that facilitate an affordable 
way to distribute malware at scale.
- **INITIAL ACCESS BROKERS (IABs)**
These individuals or entities sell guaranteed 
access into an organization’s network. IABs 
typically rent access to tools like infostealers 
from MaaS providers and then sell the 
access data to ransomware operators. 
- **RANSOMWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (RaaS)**
This widely available business model 
provides access to an operator’s proven 
tools and tactics – everything needed to 
launch ransomware attacks, complete with 
support service and even tutorials – for a 
subscription fee or percentage of ransom 
payments. 

WHAT SPYCLOUD RESEARCH SAYS
> The scale of identity exposure due to infostealers is massive: 61% of breaches 
last year were malware-related and responsible for 343.78 million stolen 
credentials. 
> Our recaptured data also shows that as many as 1 in 5 people are the victim 
of an infostealer infection, with each infection exposing anywhere from 10 
to 25+ third-party business application credentials, on average.

MASSIVE SCALE OF IDENTITY EXPOSURES CREATES NEW RISKS
> Through a deep analysis of recaptured infostealer logs, we discovered that the 
presence of infostealer malware correlates to the likelihood that a company 
will experience a ransomware attack in the near future.
> Nearly one-third of companies that experienced a ransomware event last 
year had at least one infostealer infection in the 16 weeks prior to being 
attacked.

INFOSTEALERS LEAD TO FUTURE RANSOMWARE ATTACKS
> According to our recent research, for the ﬁrst six months of 2024, at least 54% 
of devices infected with infostealer malware had an antivirus or EDR 
solution installed at the time of successful malware infection.[^2]
> With infostealers and session hijacking at play, traditional solutions like 
antivirus and multifactor authentication (MFA) don’t mean you’re
fully protected.

[^2]: 54% is likely low, as not all infostealers collect sufﬁcient data to determine whether an antivirus/endpoint
detection & response (EDR) solution was installed and running on the infected device.

So how well are current ransomware defenses keeping up with the pace, tactics, and 
scale of cybercriminal innovation? That’s what we set out to uncover.

## WHY WE DO THIS REPORT
CHECKPOINT
The numbers in this report that show the prevalence and impact of ransomware only tell part 
of the story. The developments that every organization should be concerned about happen beyond 
the edges of the cybersecurity world, deep in the criminal underground. This hidden, sprawling 
ecosystem is home to a burgeoning number of specialized products and services for
cybercrime enablement.
The standardization and professionalizing of what were once ad-hoc activities is a contributing 
factor that makes digital identities a top attack vector. With identity data – exﬁltrated from user 
devices infected by malware – at their ﬁngertips, a growing crop of unskilled cybercriminals can 
hijack a user session, initiate account takeover (ATO), and gain access that enables them to 
launch ransomware attacks. 
We do this survey because our mission is to disrupt the cycle of cybercrime, and the cybercrime 
problem as it stands today is big.

## ABOUT THE SURVEY
SURVEY METHOD: HOW WE COLLECTED DATA FOR THIS REPORT
THE 2024 SPYCLOUD MALWARE AND RANSOMWARE DEFENSE REPORT
11
For this fourth annual report, we surveyed 510 individuals in active cybersecurity roles within organizations in the 
US and the UK with at least 500 employees.
As you’ll see, we asked them about:
- Their top concerns about malware and ransomware, as well as current defense practices
- Common entry points for real-life ransomware incidents
- The impact of ransomware attacks on their organization in the past 12 months, including ransom payments, 
data recovery, and cumulative response costs 
- Key ransomware prevention strategies and future security priorities
Survey respondents’ roles range from cybersecurity analysts to C-suite security executives. About one-third of the 
participants come from practitioner roles and others outside of leadership (Figure 1).

TOP THREE CONCERNS
Like the majority of cybercriminals, ransomware actors are largely driven by their desire to build a cache of proﬁts, 
and businesses are the ones that ultimately pay that price. 
Research suggests that ransom payments surged last year, with a 2.6x increase in the average payment and 5x 
in the median. Likewise, recovery costs have followed an upward trajectory every year, climbing to an average of 
$2.73 million in 2024 (compared to $1.82 million in 2023). As ﬁnancial losses from ransomware continue to climb, 
so does the frequency of incidents: insurance claims data shows a 64%
increase in 2023 compared to the prior year.
So it’s no surprise that ransomware maintained a strong lead among our
survey respondents as the greatest threat to their organization. Like last year,
ransomware, phishing, and infostealers remain the top three concerns that keep
security professionals up at night (Figure 3).

A NEXT-GEN THREAT: HOW SESSION HIJACKING COMPOUNDS RANSOMWARE RISK
Next-generation ATO – which uses session hijacking instead of relying on traditional credentials – allows threat actors to 
sidestep all types of authentication, including MFA and passwordless authentication. By hijacking user sessions that have 
already been authenticated, cybercriminals (including ransomware operators) become a clone of a legitimate employee, 
without setting off typical anti-fraud alarm bells. This greatly increases their success rate of gaining access to an 
organization’s network and systems to launch an attack.
Last year, SpyCloud recaptured more than 20 billion cookie records from infostealer malware, with an average 2,000+ records 
per infected device. Leveraging malware-siphoned session cookies for next-generation account takeover is becoming an 
increasingly common cybercrime tactic.

Our survey ﬁndings reﬂect the growing presence of infostealers in headlines as well as their prevalence as a 
tactic. What worries us the most is the stealers’ continued evolution. Every year, the vast malware expanse 
draws in new infostealer families – often with new capabilities that allow them to bypass IAM security 
features and evade detection. Elusive, for instance, uses advanced encryption to stay stealthy, while Lumma 
can allegedly restore expired auth cookies to hijack user accounts. 

### STEALTHY STEALERS AT PLAY
> Because infostealers are designed to steal information from an infected 
host, they make great accomplices to ransomware actors attempting to 
gain credentials before moving laterally in an environment.
> Many infostealers also double as malware loaders, allowing the 
stealers to load secondary payloads such as persistent malware or 
ransomware. This behavior is observed in RisePro, Lumma, Mystic 
Stealer, and others.

TOP INFOSTEALER VILLAINS
- **StealC**
Described as a “copycat of Vidar and Raccoon,” StealC can be customized to steal data 
based on the cybercriminals’ needs. This infostealer is commonly distributed by 
so-called malware traffers – organized cybercrime workers who are responsible for 
redirecting victim traffic to malicious content operated by others.
- **MetaStealer**
An “improved version” of RedLine that steals credentials and cryptocurrency 
wallets. It’s deployed through malspam email campaigns, cracked software 
advertisements on social media like YouTube, and malvertising.
- **RisePro**
A sophisticated stealer that not only exfiltrates sensitive data but also serves as 
a malware loader, enabling the deployment of secondary payloads like other malware 
or ransomware. This dual functionality enhances its threat level. 
- **CryptBot**
Reemerged with a new and improved version targeting sensitive data like logins and 
credit card data stored in browsers. This infostealer is distributed via 
compromised websites that seem to offer cracked video games and other popular 
software.

OTHER STEALERS TO KEEP ON YOUR RADAR
- **LummaC2**
Known for its dynamic configurations, LummaC2 can customize what data it steals in 
real time. In late 2023, it added email theft from various clients, Google cookie 
regeneration, and turning infected bots into SOCKS proxies. It also targets browser 
extensions and claims to steal 2FA secrets, making it a multi-faceted threat.
- **WorldWind / Prynt Stealer**
While not as configurable as other stealers on this list, 
WorldWind uses Telegram as its exfiltration route by default, 
shortening the time to stolen information access, especially for 
less-technical cybercriminals.
- **Atomic Stealer**
Atomic is notorious for targeting macOS, and particularly cryptocurrency 
enthusiasts as its victims. It deploys a backdoor specifically designed to steal 
seed phrases from victims using the Ledger Live crypto wallet. It’s also 
well-known for harvesting data from browser extensions, making it a 
broad-spectrum threat.
- **RedLine**
A highly adaptable stealer recognized for its dynamic configurations, enabling it to 
adjust its stealing and loading capabilities on the fly. It can also regenerate 
expired Google cookies, a feature first observed with LummaC2. Its flexibility and 
advanced functionalities make it a significant threat, and it has wide acceptance by 
the criminal community.

BATTLING CYBER THREATS: FIGHTING FOR THE UPPER HAND
Despite worthwhile concerns about infostealers, surveyed organizations show some big gaps in their ability to 
remediate malware exposures. Identifying business applications exposed by malware and invalidating 
compromised web sessions are two of the most critical steps that address the long-term risks of malware – 
yet they rank at the bottom of malware detection and response capabilities (Figure 5).
Perceptions do vary across roles, though. Most notably, executive leaders are the only group that rank all of their 
organization’s capabilities higher than the average across all roles. In general, they seem more conﬁdent than 
other cybersecurity professionals in their security teams’ capabilities.

having better visibility of malware-exﬁltrated data (such as exposed credentials and session cookies/tokens) and 
automating remediation workﬂows would signiﬁcantly improve their organization’s resistance to ransomware

### MALWARE INFECTION REMEDIATION PRACTICES: FAR FROM A CRITICAL HIT
While there’s universal agreement that more needs to be done to address the malware problem, we also asked 
organizations what their standard practices look like today to better understand the baseline. 
The top routine actions that organizations take in response to a malware infection on an infected device are:
- Investigating the incident (79%)
- Resetting passwords for portentially exposed applications (77%)
- Attempting to remove the malware (67%)

Regardless of what drove the change, keep in mind the shift to a “brute force” reset and wipe doesn’t solve the 
larger issue of stolen data, and thus access, in the wrong hands. Reviewing logs to analyze exposure and 
determine the necessary remediation path should be a high priority. Yet even fewer security teams do this than 
before: only 55% this year vs. 73% last year (Figure 7).
