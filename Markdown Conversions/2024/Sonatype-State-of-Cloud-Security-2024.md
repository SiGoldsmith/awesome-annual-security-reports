State of 
the Software 
Supply Chain

As we mark the 10th annual State of the Software Supply Chain report, the transformation of open 
source software has been nothing short of profound. Open source consumption has exploded, with estimates placing 
this year’s downloads at over 6\.6 trillion. This reliance on open source components, now making up to 90% of the modern 
software application, has ushered in both unprecedented innovation and complex challenges for software supply chains. 
Because of this, the industry has also become increasingly regulated, moving from a hands\-off approach in the early 
2010s to proactive frameworks that address growing cybersecurity risks in the global software supply chain.

This year’s report, backed by data from over 7 million open source projects, double\-clicks on many of the unsettling 
trends in security and risk management we’ve been following in the past 10 reports. Notably, the rise of open source 
malware and software supply chain attacks has become a critical threat. Examples such as the LUMMA malware found in 
PyPI and the XZ Utils package backdoor highlight the growing sophistication of these attacks, which often bypass tradi\-
tional security measures, leaving organizations vulnerable. In fact, the number of malicious packages has grown by 156% 
year\-over\-year, posing a significant risk to enterprises that fail to manage their OSS dependencies effectively.

Here’s what else we found. 

1

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARYOpen Source Scale and 
Consumption Behaviors

Open source software adoption is at a multitrillion 
request scale, with ecosystems like JavaScript (npm) and 
Python (PyPI) leading the charge:

• JavaScript (npm) accounted for a staggering 4\.5 trillion 
requests in 2024, representing 70% year\-over\-year 
growth in requests .

• Python (PyPI), driven by AI and cloud adoption, is esti\-
mated to reach 530 billion package requests by the 
end of 2024, up 87% year\-over\-year. 

But this growth brings new risks. A rise in open source 
malware has infiltrated open source ecosystems at an 
alarming rate. 

Over 512,847 malicious packages have been logged 
just in the past year, a 156% increase year\-over\-year , 
highlighting a critical need for organizations to adapt their 
consumption practices. Traditional security tools often 
fail to detect these novel attacks, leaving developers and 
automated build environments highly vulnerable. This 
has resulted in a new wave of next\-generation supply 
chain attacks, which target developers directly, bypass\-
ing existing defenses.

Further, each ecosystem presents different challenges. 
For instance, npm has experienced much of its growth 
from spam; Python is the fastest\-growing in projects and 
volume, and shows more vulnerabilities per package 
compared to others; and Java (Maven) has an average of 
28 versions per project.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARYPersistent Risk and Consumer 
Complacency 

In parallel, organizations continue to struggle with effi\-
cient risk mitigation. This is why this year, we introduce 
the concept of “Persistent Risk,” a combination of 
unfixed and corrosive vulnerabilities that continues 
to erode the security integrity of software over time. A 
prime example of this is Log4j, where 13% of downloads 
remain vulnerable three years after the Log4Shell vul\-
nerability was exposed. While we’re extremely focused 
on this rise in contaminated open source projects, or 
malware, the reality is all open source or commercial soft\-
ware will eventually have bugs that evolve into vulnera\-
bilities; they age more like steel, not aluminum, becoming 
rusty after extensive corrosion. 

The prevalence of such risks underscores the compla\-
cency that still defines much of the industry’s approach 
to open source consumption. 

• 80% of application dependencies remain un\-upgraded 
for over a year, even though 95% of these vulnerable 
versions have safer alternatives readily available. It’s 
not a matter of ‘if’ a breach will occur, but ‘when.’ 

• Only 0\.5% of OSS components have no available 

update (No Path Forward), meaning that nearly all risk 
is preventable if organizations take proactive steps to 
update their dependencies.

• Even when updates are applied, 3\.6% of dependen\-

cies are still vulnerable because they were updated to 
another insecure version.

• Our analysis of over 20,000 enterprise applications 

shows that reliance on EOL (end\-of\-life) components, 
which no longer receive updates, leads to the gradual 
breakdown of software integrity, strongly indicating 
increased security vulnerabilities.

• Looking at discoverability revealed that, despite over 
seven million open source components, only 10\.5% 
(about 762,000\) are actively used. This disparity 
highlights the noise developers face when selecting 
components.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARYDespite advances in supply chain security practices, 
consumer behavior lags, illustrating a critical failure in 
consumption practices. To address these issues, orga\-
nizations must embrace best practices like proactive 
dependency management, choosing high\-quality compo\-
nents, and avoiding malware risks. 

To better understand how to actually choose high\-quality 
components, we took a look at key heuristics \- which 
include active community engagement, projects publish\-
ing Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs), and support from 
recognized foundations. We notably found that projects 
backed by recognized foundations have better security 
practices and reduced vulnerabilities.

Efficiency and Waste: 
The Time Drain on Developers

Efficiency in the development process is also at risk. 
Managing open source risks requires optimizing security 
policies and practices to keep up with the fast\-paced evo\-
lution of new OSS libraries. Organizations struggle with 
the impracticality of slowing down DevOps processes 
for manual vulnerability reviews, leading to frustration 
among developers. Enterprises must aim to reduce waste 
by optimizing their remediation effort with the best possi\-
ble software composition analysis tool.

Through our analysis, we know:

• Size of application does not matter—with the average 
applications containing 180 components, even small 
applications face unmanageable workloads due to 
increasing dependencies.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY• Quality data does matter. 92% of crowdsourced or 
publicly available vulnerability data needed a cor\-
rection once reviewed in more detail by a security 
researcher; 69% of vulnerabilities that were initially 
scored below 7 on the CVSS scale were corrected to 7 
or higher, creating what we’re calling surprise risk and 
a false sense of comfort.

• Efficiency isn’t just about security, but about licenses: 
while an open source project typically has an overarch\-
ing license, individual files may have different licenses 
as contributions grow, potentially impacting the project 
downstream.

The current reactive approach to vulnerabilities and 
license reviews wastes developer time, leading to ineffi\-
ciency and higher costs. To combat this, enterprises need 
effective software composition analysis tools that provide 
high\-quality component intelligence and integrate seam\-
lessly into the development process.

A Call to Action and Vigilance: 
Proactive Management, Continuous 
Security, and Advanced Tooling

As attackers evolve their strategies to target the very 
foundation of software supply chains, the responsibility 
falls on software manufacturers, consumers, and regula\-
tors to adopt robust security practices. We can stop the 
bleeding and mitigate these mounting risks with proac\-
tive dependency management, advanced tooling, and 
earlier security intervention.

• Always\-on security practices, when tools like Software 

Composition Analysis (SCA) are integrated directly 
into CI/CD pipelines, and throughout the development 
process — this can reduce wasted developer time and 
provide context for informed decision\-making and get 
ahead of this risk. 

• Reducing Persistent Risk is possible by focusing on 
tools that help manage dependencies and apply real\-
time vulnerability detection. In fact, we found that proj\-
ects using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to man\-
age OSS dependencies showed a 264\-day reduction 
in mean time to remediate (MTTR) compared to those 
that did not . 

By embedding these practices early and managing OSS 
consumption more rigorously, organizations can cut down 
on risks before they grow corrosive and costly. Organi\-
zations must prioritize an advanced SCA tool that helps 
by selecting high\-quality, well\-maintained components, 
addressing risks as early as possible, and remaining 
vigilant against the evolving landscape of supply chain 
attacks. This proactive approach not only reduces devel\-
oper frustration but also cuts down on wasted resources. 
Failure to do so leaves software ecosystems open to cata\-
strophic breaches and operational inefficiencies.

The balance between innovation and security is more crit\-
ical than ever. Open source ecosystems will continue to 
fuel technological breakthroughs, but organizations must 
evolve their security practices to avoid becoming victims 
of their own success. By addressing complacency, adopt\-
ing robust tooling, and staying vigilant, software manufac\-
turers can mitigate the Persistent Risks that threaten the 
future of innovation.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10 YEAR 
LOOK BACK

As we look back on 10 years of data collection 
for the State of the Software Supply Chain, 
it’s a good time to reflect on what has changed — and 
what hasn’t. This retrospective examines four key dimen\-
sions: attackers, publishers, consumers, and regulators.

A decade ago, the cultural landscape was vastly differ\-
ent. Social media was just beginning to show its wide\-
spread impact. Instagram had recently been acquired 
by Facebook, while Snapchat rejected a multibillion\-dol\-
lar offer from the same giant. Smartphones were every\-
where, but apps like TikTok, which would later reshape 
digital culture, were still far out on the horizon.

In the tech world, cloud computing was maturing, but not 
yet as integrated into daily life as it is today. Amazon Web 
Services (AWS) was proliferating, but the full implications of 
cloud\-native development and the shift towards serverless 
architectures were just beginning to be understood. Kuber\-
netes, which has subsequently revolutionized container 
orchestration and become a cornerstone of modern infra\-
structure, was only recently open\-sourced by Google.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINLOOK BACK: 10 YEARS OF SSCRMany of today’s tech staples were in their infancy. Zoom, 
now key to remote work, was starting to gain traction, and 
Slack had just launched, reshaping workplace commu\-
nication. The Apple Watch and Amazon Echo were just 
exciting rumors. Smart assistants in every home were still 
a futuristic idea.

During this period, cybersecurity concerns, particularly 
in the software supply chain, were gaining attention. The 
Cyber Supply Chain Management and Transparency 
Act of 2014, commonly known as the Royce Bill, high\-
lighted the growing recognition of these risks. 
One of its most forward\-thinking provisions was the 
Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) requirement — a com\-
prehensive and confidentially supplied list of each binary 
component within the software, firmware, or product. 

An SBOM mandate when it was first suggested 
10 years ago could have redefined software 
security and stopped today’s supply chain 
attacks before they began.

Though the bill never became law, it’s worth considering 
how aggressive software transparency a decade ago 
could have led to a more secure ecosystem today. Had 
the SBOM requirement been implemented back then, 
we would have a much deeper understanding and con\-
trol over the components that make up our digital infra\-
structure today. In fact, we might have mitigated many 
of the supply chain attacks and vulnerabilities that have 
plagued the industry in recent years, setting a higher 
standard for security and trust in software development 
long before these issues reached the critical point they 
now occupy.

This period also preceded the mainstream rise of AI. 
While AI research was active, and companies like Google 
and Facebook were investing heavily, public exposure 
was limited to Netflix recommendations and early virtual 
assistants like Siri and Alexa.

Attackers and the Evolution of 
Software Supply Chain Exploits

Over the past decade, the software supply chain has 
become a primary attack vector for malicious actors. What 
was once a relatively niche method of attack has evolved 
into one of the most significant cybersecurity threats today, 
driven by the interconnectedness of modern software eco\-
systems and the increasing reliance on open source com\-
ponents. As software supply chains have grown in com\-
plexity, so too have the strategies employed by attackers, 
who have shifted their focus from directly targeting orga\-
nizations to exploiting vulnerabilities within the broader 
supply chain and all of its downstream consumers.

Early Years: Struts, Heartbleed, 
and Shellshock (2014–2016\)

In the mid\-2010s, the software supply chain began attract\-
ing more attention from attackers, exemplified by early inci\-
dents like CVE\-2014\-0094, a remote code execution flaw 
in Apache Struts that allowed attackers to execute arbitrary 
code on servers running vulnerable framework versions. 
Although this vulnerability didn’t gain the same notoriety 
as later software supply chain incidents, it highlighted 

77

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINLOOK BACK: 10 YEARS OF SSCRthe risks posed by unpatched open source components 
that many organizations relied on for critical infrastruc\-
ture. This issue came to a head in 2017 with the Equifax 
breach, but the 2014 vulnerability served as an early 
warning of the dangers of failing to manage the security 
of widely\-used software dependencies.

Around the same time, Heartbleed and Shellshock sent 
shockwaves through the cybersecurity world. Heart\-
bleed, a flaw in OpenSSL, exposed millions of servers to 
data breaches, while Shellshock allowed remote code 
execution on Unix\-based systems. Both demonstrated 
the vast attack surface of widely\-used open source com\-
ponents and emphasized the importance of securing the 
software supply chain.

These early attacks revealed how vulnerabilities in core 
open source software could ripple across industries, 
underscoring the need for better patch management, 
transparency, and proactive security measures.

2017: The Equifax Breach and the Rise 
of Targeted Supply Chain attacks

The 2017 Equifax breach, caused by the failure to patch 
a known Apache Struts vulnerability (not the 2014 vul\-
nerability discussed above), marked a turning point for 
software supply chain security. It showed how a sin\-
gle unpatched flaw in a widely\-used framework could 
lead to a catastrophic breach, as attackers exploited 

This shift from opportunistic to 
targeted exploitation signaled a 
new era of supply chain attacks. 

weaknesses in open source components to access criti\-
cal systems and exfiltrate confidential information for mil\-
lions of consumers. The incident was a wake\-up call for 
many organizations, illustrating the devastating effects of 
not properly managing and securing your software sup\-
ply chains, and bringing open source supply chain vulner\-
abilities into nationwide headlines for the first time.

2017 marked another significant turning point as the 
year when the first targeted attacks on the software sup\-
ply chain began to emerge using open source malware. 
Data from the Sonatype State of the Software Supply 
Chain reports in 2017 and 2018 shows that this was the 
period when attackers started to intentionally inject mali\-
cious code into popular open source libraries, targeting 
the very foundation of the software supply chain. These 
early attacks were highly selective and designed to infect 
specific projects with high adoption rates. For instance, 
compromised versions of popular npm packages and 
other open source components were downloaded by 
developers, inadvertently spreading malware to down\-
stream systems.

This shift from opportunistic to targeted exploitation 
signaled a new era of supply chain attacks. Attackers rec\-
ognized the strategic value of compromising software at 
its source, potentially reaching thousands of users with a 
single strike. This laid the groundwork for more sophisti\-
cated and large\-scale exploits in the years to come.

Next Generation Software Supply Chain Attacks (2019–2024\)

Malicious OSS packages discovered (2019\-2024\).

Sadly, seven years later, in 2024, this is still one of the least 
understood and recognized attack vectors by security 
teams. The number of attacks detected in the software 
supply chain doubled again in 2024, indicating that our 
industry is mainly defenseless against these growing risks.

2020: SolarWinds and the Expansion 
of Supply Chain Attacks
The SolarWinds attack in late 2020 further demonstrated 
the growing sophistication of software supply chain 
threats. In this highly coordinated operation, attackers 
infiltrated SolarWinds’ build environment and embedded 
malicious code (Sunburst) into software updates for the 
company’s Orion platform, distributed to thousands of 
government agencies and corporations worldwide. Solar\-
Winds represented a new attack level, where adversaries 

exploited vulnerabilities deep within the development 
pipeline to compromise trusted software used by high\-
value targets. This attack was a technical success and 
underscored the strategic value of supply chain compro\-
mises for espionage and broader cyber warfare — and 
was the roadmap nation state attackers needed to recog\-
nize how effective a software supply chain attack could 
truly be.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINLOOK BACK: 10 YEARS OF SSCR2021–2022: Log4Shell, the Vulnerability 
that Set the Internet on Fire 

2024: The Attempted XZ\-Utils Supply 
Chain Attack

The discovery of the Log4Shell vulnerability in late 2021 
marked another critical moment in the evolution of sup\-
ply chain threats. A widely used open source logging 
utility, Log4j was embedded in thousands of enterprise 
applications and its critical vulnerability opened a mas\-
sive attack surface. Attackers quickly capitalized on this 
flaw, and, within hours of its public disclosure, began 
launching widespread exploitation campaigns. Log4S\-
hell demonstrated how vulnerabilities in a seemingly 
obscure open source component could ripple through 
the entire software ecosystem, impacting organizations 
across industries. 

It was only in the wake of Log4shell did the industry 
become widely conscious of the impacts of the massive 
growth of open source dependency consumption com\-
bined with lack of mature controls — the very thing this 
report has been evangelizing since 2014 which could 
have been markedly impacted had the Royce bill passed 
back then. This incident finally accelerated the urgency 
around supply chain security, pushing governments and 
organizations to adopt more stringent practices like Soft\-
ware Bills of Materials (SBOMs) and continuous monitor\-
ing of open source components.

In 2024, the attempted supply chain attack on XZ Utils, 
a widely used compression library, marked a dangerous 
escalation in open source software security. Unlike typi\-
cal attacks, this sophisticated, likely nation\-state\-backed 
operation followed the “benevolent stranger” playbook. 
The attackers played a long game, leveraging social engi\-
neering to gain trust within the project, which had been 
maintained by a single developer for nearly two decades. 
In 2022, pressure from suspected bogus accounts paved 
the way for a new contributor, Jia Tan, who gradually 
gained the maintainer’s trust.

Over two years, Jia introduced encrypted malicious code 
into binary test files embedded in the XZ source code. 
These files, common in compression packages, went unno\-
ticed due to their subtle nature. The attackers were just days 
away from having this compromised version ingested by 
major Linux distributions, which would have allowed back\-
doors to be deployed to countless systems globally.

The attack was thwarted only by chance, averting wide\-
spread infiltration of Linux\-based devices and enterprises 
worldwide. This incident highlights the growing trend 
of highly organized attackers targeting essential open 
source projects, aiming for maximum disruption within 
the global software ecosystem.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINLOOK BACK: 10 YEARS OF SSCRConsumers of Open Source

Since we published the first State of the Software Supply 
Chain Report, the profile of open source software con\-
sumers has expanded significantly. It has evolved from 
primarily being for developers and smaller organizations 
to now being integral to organizations of all sizes, from 
startups to large enterprises to government agencies 
around the world. 

The growing reliance on open source reflects confi\-
dence in its flexibility and innovation, as well as its ability 
to reduce time\-to\-market and development costs and 
increase organizational agility. But it also brings new 
risks, particularly with poor dependency management 
and the rise of open source malware.

13% 

of Log4j downloads are still for known 
vulnerable versions, nearly 3 years after 
the vulnerability’s discovery. 

Nearly three years after the discovery of the Log4Shell 
vulnerability, 13% of Log4j downloads are still for known 
vulnerable versions. While this is an improvement, it 
should be near zero based on the broad public aware\-
ness of the vulnerability, signaling persistent issues with 
dependency management. Additionally, our research in 
both 2022 and 2023 found that 96% of vulnerable com\-
ponents downloaded had a fixed, non\-vulnerable version 
available. In this year’s report, this figure only improved 
slightly to 94\.9%, highlighting poor consumption practices 
aren’t really changing and organizations are bringing in 
exponentially more risk by not paying attention.

Poor consumption practices aren’t 
really changing and organizations 
are bringing in exponentially more 
risk by not paying attention.

Worse, our research clearly shows that poor dependency 
management often pairs with other poor choices. Failure 
to regularly update and oversee open source compo\-
nents allows known vulnerabilities to persist, posing seri\-
ous risks to the software supply chain.

Meanwhile, the threat of open source malware continues 
to grow as attackers exploit gaps in poor consumption 
practices. As mentioned above, the XZ Utils project take\-
over demonstrated how widely used components, often 
maintained by overworked and underfunded teams, can 
become entry points for malicious code.

As open source consumption evolves, so must best 
practices. Organizations must adopt rigorous practices, 
improve dependency management, and address open 
source malware risks to ensure the security and reliability 
of software supply chains. For more details, see The Evo\-
lution of Open Source Risk section in this year’s report.

Publishers of Open Source

Over the past decade, open source publishers (developers/
projects that are creating and then sharing components 
via public registries like Maven Central) have shown a 
remarkable transformation in their behavior, driven by both 
increased demand and growing expectations for rapid 
innovation. The data on release frequencies highlights key 
trends in how projects are maintained and evolved.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINLOOK BACK: 10 YEARS OF SSCRFIGURE 1\.2
Release Frequency of Open Source Projects

Projects that released faster, slower or the same as the prior year.

From 2010 through 2024, there has been a consistent 
increase in the number of projects where release fre\-
quency grew year\-over\-year. In particular, 2023 and 
2024 saw massive growth, with over 1\.8 million projects 
increasing their release cadence in 2023 alone. This 
surge reflects the accelerating pace of development 
as publishers race to release new features, fix bugs, 
and address security vulnerabilities to meet the grow\-
ing demands of consumers and regulatory pressures. 
However, this also introduces challenges related to sus\-
tainability and stability, as smaller, independent projects 
struggle to keep up with the pressure to update and 
improve continuously.

Despite the overall increase, a significant number of 
projects saw their release frequency decrease or remain 
unchanged, particularly after 2020\. 

By 2024, over 300,000 projects had slowed or halted 
their release cadence, indicating burnout, resource short\-
ages, or shifting priorities among smaller publishers. This 
shows that while some thrive in a fast\-paced environment, 
many struggle to maintain activity.

Interestingly, projects with stable release cadences have 
steadily increased, though remain smaller in comparison. 
These mature projects likely prioritize long\-term mainte\-
nance and reliability over rapid development, catering to 
industries that require stable, well\-tested software.

While projects are generally moving more quickly now 
than they were a decade ago, the rate of vulnerability 
remediation is slowing significantly.

The data showing how long it takes projects to update 
their dependencies in response to disclosed vulnerabilities 
reveals both progress and ongoing challenges in the open 
source community. While the need for rapid responses to 
vulnerabilities is well\-understood, the actual time it takes 
for publishers to update dependencies and release secure 
versions has varied significantly over the years.

In 2017, the mean time to remediate vulnerabilities was rela\-
tively short, with some fixes implemented in under 25 days. 
However, by 2023 and 2024, delays had increased signifi\-
cantly, with some projects taking over 400 days to release 
secure updates. In 2024, several projects had average fix 
times exceeding 300 days, with one reaching 470 days. 

As the interconnectedness of 
open source projects increase, 
so do the challenges of maintaining 
prompt security updates.

This trend highlights a growing lag in security response, 
even as timely updates become more critical.

This pattern reflects a growing complexity in software 
supply chains, where projects often rely on multiple lay\-
ers of dependencies. As the interconnectedness of open 
source projects increases, so do the challenges of main\-

How long projects took on average to remediate dependency vulnerabilities broken down by severity.

The increasing mean time to remediate vulnerabilities 
points to the strain on publishers to manage their depen\-
dency chains efficiently, despite the growing regulatory 
and consumer expectations for faster responses.

creating a ripple effect across the software supply chain. 
The slow pace of updates demonstrates the need for 
more robust tooling, automation, and support for over\-
whelmed open source maintainers.

This delay in addressing vulnerabilities has significant 
implications for the overall security of the open source 
ecosystem. As projects take longer to implement fixes, 
the risk of exploitation by malicious actors increases, 

Some critical vulnerabilities in 2024 took over 
500 days to fix, indicating that the response 
times for the most severe security issues are 
worsening as complexity in the software supply 
chain increases.

If we break down the mean time to remediate into buckets 
by vulnerability severity, we see some additional trends.

Over the past decade, the mean time to remediate 
vulnerabilities has shown a troubling upward trend. 
While critical vulnerabilities historically received the fast\-
est attention, with average fix times between 200 and 
250 days, the data from 2024 shows that even critical 
issues are now taking significantly longer to address.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINLOOK BACK: 10 YEARS OF SSCRFor high\-severity vulnerabilities, the pattern is similar. Ear\-
lier in the decade, the average fix times ranged between 
150 and 300 days, but in recent years, these have 
extended beyond 400 days. This growing lag poses a 
substantial risk to organizations that rely on open source 
components, as longer fix times create larger windows of 
exposure for potential exploits.

The most alarming aspect of the data is the spike in fix 
times for medium\- and low\-severity vulnerabilities, where 
we see the clearest indication that publisher capacity 
has been exceeded. Low\-severity vulnerabilities, which 
previously took 300\-400 days to fix, are now seeing 
delays of 500\-700 days or more, with some stretch\-
ing out nearly 800 days in 2024\. This sharp increase 
suggests that publishers are overwhelmed, struggling 
to keep up with both the volume of security issues 
and the ongoing demands of innovation and feature

When we look at the growth of CVE reports over the last 
decade, it shines a light on why publishers are struggling

Cumulative SBOM Publishing Counts

How many components were published with SBOMs.

Overall, the data highlights that the software supply chain 
has reached a critical point where publisher resources 
cannot keep pace with the rising volume of vulnerabili\-
ties. Without improved automation, tooling, and support 
for maintainers, the delays in addressing vulnerabilities 
will continue to increase, leaving organizations exposed 
to many security risks.

Initiatives like the U.S. Executive Order 14028 have 
driven increased awareness of SBOMs across the indus\-
try, and as a result, we’ve seen open source projects 
begin to create SBOMs. However, we are still seeing 
essentially linear growth. In the early days of March 2022, 
we saw about 68 new SBOMs published per day. More 
than two years later in June of 2024, we are seeing a little 
over 200 per day (inconsistently).

SBOM Production by Open 
Source Projects 

Following the publication of two new SBOM standards, 
CycloneDX and SPDX v3, and guided by global gov\-
ernment regulations requiring or heavily encouraging 
SBOMs, we have seen some progress in the number of 
projects publishing SBOMs alongside their components.

While this 3x growth is encouraging, 
if we compare it to the overall growth 
in new components in the same time 
period, the view is much darker.

Cumulative SBOM Publishing Counts vs Cumulative Published Components

Comparing the growth of components with SBOMs vs the overall total shows we are not even beginning to keep up.

Although the number of published SBOMs is increasing, 
it is far outpaced by the growth rate of new components. 
This disparity suggests that while SBOM adoption is 
growing, it has not yet reached a point where it matches 
the pace of component releases. This needs to change. 
As more regulations and security practices mandate 
transparency and traceability through SBOMs, particu\-
larly for open source projects that form the backbone of 
modern software, ecosystems must keep pace.

We don’t want to ignore the progress, but the software 
industry has significant work to do to embrace compre\-
hensive software transparency.

Over the past decade, regulation of open source soft\-
ware has evolved significantly, driven by the increasing 
recognition of its critical role in the global software supply 
chain. A hands\-off approach in the early 2010s has given 
way to more proactive regulatory frameworks, aimed at 
addressing the growing cybersecurity risks associated 
with software supply chains. Below is a listing of some of 
the most impactful recent regulations and their effects on 
the software supply chain:

2014:
The Cyber Supply Chain Management and Transparency 
Act 2014 (Royce Bill) was an important early milestone. 
While the Royce Bill ultimately didn’t become law, it 
called for a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), now a 
cornerstone of modern supply chain security efforts. 
The Bill’s vision, requiring organizations to maintain 
a comprehensive, confidential list of software com\-
ponents, stood in stark contrast to the industry’s slow 
pace of embracing this level of transparency, and it 
would take nearly a decade for policy to catch up to 
this forward\-thinking proposal. 

It would take nearly a decade for 
policy to catch up to the forward\-
thinking proposals put forth in the 
Cyber Supply Chain Management 
and Transparency Act of 2014\. 

2018: 
The European Union General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) introduced stringent data protection requirements, 
indirectly affecting the software supply chain by imposing 
heavy fines for non compliance with data handling prac\-
tices. It has forced organizations to scrutinize the open 
source components they use, ensuring that they meet the 
necessary data protection standards, thereby influencing 
how software is developed and maintained.

2020:
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is sim\-
ilar to GDPR, with heightened awareness around data 
privacy, pushing organizations to be more transparent 
about how they manage data within their software supply 
chains. This regulation has led to increased demand for 
tools and practices that ensure compliance at every level 
of software development, including the use of third\-party 
open source components.

2020: 
Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC), 
implemented by the U.S. Department of Defense, has set 
new cybersecurity standards for defense contractors, 
requiring them to demonstrate a certain level of cyber\-
security maturity, including the management of software 
supply chains. This has led to more rigorous vetting and 
monitoring of open source components used in defense\- 
related software, setting a precedent for other sectors.

2021:
U.S. Executive Order 14028 on Improving the Nation’s 
Cybersecurity directly addressed the need for greater 
security within the software supply chain, emphasizing the 
importance of SBOMs. It has accelerated the adoption of 
SBOMs across industries, providing transparency into the 
components used in software and helping to identify and 
mitigate vulnerabilities more effectively.

The BSI Update aligns closely with the EU’s Cyber Resil\-
iency Act. The update expands the regulatory powers 
of the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and 
strengthens cybersecurity requirements for critical infra\-
structure sectors, including energy, healthcare, and finan\-
cial services. The law also mandates stronger security mea\-
sures and reporting obligations for digital service providers.

2023:
The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is applica\-
ble to financial institutions within the EU. DORA mandates 
stringent requirements for the security of digital systems, 
including the software supply chain. It has forced financial 
institutions to take a closer look at the security of open 
source components, driving better practices in vetting, man\-
aging, and updating these components to avoid disruptions.

2021: 
The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) 
highlighted software supply chain attacks as a growing 
threat, especially in the context of critical infrastructure. 
Their threat landscape report outlines key risks posed by 
supply chain vulnerabilities, recommending that organi\-
zations enhance security across their entire software sup\-
ply chain. The report emphasizes collaboration between 
industry and government to strengthen the security of 
open source software and third\-party components.

2023:
The Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2 
Directive) is the EU’s updated framework to improve cyber\-
security across member states. It expands the scope of 
organizations required to comply with cybersecurity stan\-
dards and imposes stricter obligations on managing risks, 
including those within software supply chains. The directive 
has pressured organizations to adopt more robust security 
practices, particularly concerning the use of open source 
software in critical infrastructure.

The Secure by Design framework 
encourages software manufacturers to 
integrate security measures from the earliest 
stages of development to ensure products 
are inherently secure when released.

2023:
The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agen\-
cy’s Secure by Design framework encourages software 
manufacturers to integrate security measures from the 
earliest stages of development to ensure products are 
inherently secure when released. The goal is to shift the 
cybersecurity burden from consumers to software suppli\-
ers, promoting a more resilient digital ecosystem.

2023:
Self\-attestation for secure software development prac\-
tices, including adherence to the NIST Secure Software 
Development Framework (SSDF), was adopted following 
Executive Order 14028, issued in May 2021\. This executive 
order directed federal agencies to require software pro\-
viders to self\-attest that they are following secure develop\-
ment practices, including those outlined in the SSDF. 

2023: 
The CISA Cybersecurity Strategic Plan for FY2024\-2026 
focuses on enhancing U.S. cybersecurity by improving 
threat detection and mitigation, securing critical infrastruc\-
ture, and fostering strong partnerships. The plan emphasizes 
building a resilient cyber workforce, increasing collaboration 
between public, private, and international partners, and 
addressing emerging technologies like quantum computing. 
It also prioritizes hardening networks and driving security 
through information sharing and secure\-by\-design technol\-
ogy. Overall, the strategy reflects a whole\-of\-government 
approach aimed at strengthening national cyber defense.

The Draft Law on Security through Integrated Economic 
Measures from Japan is aimed at ensuring national secu\-
rity through integrated economic measures, particularly 
in sectors deemed security\-sensitive, such as energy, 
water, IT, finance, and transportation. The law places a 
narrow focus on the procurement of overseas software, 
aiming to safeguard critical infrastructure by preventing 
the use of software that may pose security risks to these 
vital sectors.

2024: 
The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), recently adopted in 
the EU, is designed to ensure that products with digital 
elements are developed with cybersecurity in mind. It 
imposes strict security requirements on manufacturers, 
including those using open source components. The 
CRA’s focus on the entire product lifecycle — from devel\-
opment to decommissioning — means that open source 
software must be scrutinized, not just for its initial secu\-
rity but also for how it will be maintained and updated 
over time. This regulation is expected to drive significant 
change in how open source projects are managed and 
maintained, particularly in high\-risk industries.

2024/2025: 
The updated Product Liability Directive (PLD) in the EU 
extends liability to software products, including those 
incorporating open source components. This change 
means that organizations can be held liable for damages 
caused by defective software, placing new pressures on 
companies to ensure the security and reliability of the 
open source software they use. The PLD is likely to lead 
to more rigorous testing and certification processes for 
open source components as companies seek to mitigate 
the risk of liability.

2025: 
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 
is working toward establishing a unified cybersecurity 
regulatory framework by 2025\. This effort aims to create 
common cybersecurity standards across the ten ASEAN 
member states, addressing the increasing cyber threats in 
the region. The regulations will focus on securing critical 
infrastructure, improving information sharing, and fostering 
international cooperation in the face of rising cyber risks.

The 2020s have witnessed 
a surge in regulatory action 
aimed at addressing software 
supply chain risks. 

Navigating the Future of Open Source 
and Software Supply Chain Security

As we reflect on the past decade, the evolution of soft\-
ware supply chain security has been shaped by a grow\-
ing recognition of the critical role open source software 
plays in global digital infrastructure. The challenges 
posed by vulnerabilities in widely used components, like 
Apache Struts, Heartbleed, and Log4Shell, have illumi\-
nated the fragility of our interconnected systems. These 
incidents underscored the need for increased transpar\-
ency, accountability, and better security practices across 
the entire software development lifecycle.

While the early 2010s saw isolated incidents and slow reg\-
ulatory responses, the emergence of frameworks like the 
Cyber Supply Chain Management and Transparency Act 
of 2014 (Royce Bill) introduced forward\-thinking concepts 
like SBOMs. Although it did not become law, the bill’s 
vision laid the groundwork for today’s regulatory efforts. 

2121

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINLOOK BACK: 10 YEARS OF SSCRThe rise in mean time to remediate vulnerabilities, partic\-
ularly for low\- and medium\-severity issues, suggests that 
publisher capacity is being stretched beyond its limits. 
Even as the number of SBOMs grows, it has not kept 
pace with the explosion of new components. This gap 
signals the need for better automation, tooling, and sup\-
port for open source maintainers to ensure vulnerabilities 
are addressed more quickly.

The future of the software supply chain will depend on 
our ability to meet these challenges head\-on. As regula\-
tions continue to evolve and attackers grow more sophis\-
ticated, organizations must embrace comprehensive 
security measures and foster collaboration across the 
industry. Only by building a foundation of transparency, 
accountability, and proactive security can we ensure that 
the open source ecosystem remains both vibrant and 
secure for the decade ahead.

It took nearly a decade for policy to align with the 
vision of software transparency proposed in the Royce 
Bill, as seen in recent regulations like Executive Order 
14028, which has accelerated the adoption of SBOMs 
across industries.

The 2020s witnessed a surge in regulatory action aimed 
at addressing software supply chain risks. Regulations 
like the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and the Product Lia\-
bility Directive (PLD) from the European Union signal a 
new era of accountability, where the security and reliabil\-
ity of open source components are no longer optional but 
essential. These efforts highlight the growing expectation 
that organizations adopt robust practices for managing 
the security of their software supply chains.

However, as highlighted by the data, challenges remain. 
A striking 95% of the time, when vulnerable components 
are consumed, a fixed version already exists. This trend 
has persisted over the last three years, showing little 
improvement. Despite the availability of patched ver\-
sions, consumers continue to make poor choices when 
selecting dependencies. This behavior underscores the 
need for stronger security awareness, education, and 
enforcement mechanisms across organizations.

of Open Source

The growth of open source is a signal for innovation within the software industry. You can 
observe new waves of technology being invented and adopted by measuring it. 

With this growth, the engineers and innovators at large gain access to a source of innovation that is world\-class and 
can in turn innovate faster. 

The scale of open source is something that is hard to grasp intuitively and relate to a human scale, yet has a tremendous 
influence on how we innovate via software. At\-scale effects may be unanticipated in nature and as usage grows ever 
wider, new risks and rewards emerge for its maintainers, users and the ecosystems they serve.

In this year’s report, we are taking a 10\-year perspective on all measures. What is clear is that open source adoption 
has reached a multi\-trillion request scale and shows no signs of slowing down. Over the decade, new challenges 
have appeared on the ecosystem scale that we will deep dive into. All our data is sourced from public sources and 
was collected in July 2024\.

Open Source Supply Balloons 
Due to Malicious Actors

The supply side of open source is an interesting metric 
to gauge the pace and scale of innovation that occurs in 
a given ecosystem. The more open source projects are 
published every year, the more innovation occurs in a 
given ecosystem.

This year however, we observe both an unusual expan\-
sion effect in one ecosystem in particular, which was not 
organic in nature. This new kind of problem — packages 
intended to spam an ecosystem — shows that open eco\-
systems are liable to abuse. In this case, the act of pub\-
lishing garbage also results in consumption that can be 
measured at scale. 

Over recent years, npm has experienced a groundswell 
of new projects being published — not all of which have 
good intentions. Increasingly, the ecosystem has been 
a subject of malicious packages of various description 
as well as spam of various types, including packages 
aiming to redeem crypto rewards, packages aimed at 
publishing content via unorthodox means and others. 
Many ecosystems have faced challenges coping with this 
type of increase — PyPI famously paused accepting new 
releases due to a deluge of malicious releases.

Not all growth is organic. We’ve 
seen an unusual uptick in packages 
intended to spam — open ecosystems 
are liable to abuse.

large volumes of malware and spam being published into 
the ecosystem, as is evident from concurrent and identi\-
cal drops in project growth rates.

Between 2023 and 2024, the number of available open 
source projects grew an average of 11%. The average

Rockets Through npm

This year will see the largest single annual consumption 
increase we have on record — the estimated volume of 
open source packages the world will download by the 
end of the year will sit by our estimates at 6\.6 Trillion 
requests. This above baseline growth can be attributed to 
two things: spam and AI.

Broken down by ecosystem, it’s clear to see that npm is 
the largest contributor to this growth spurt, somewhat 
distorted by the malware spam observed this year, 

followed by PyPI and Maven Central. npm has undergone 
the second largest request growth since 2020, which is 
an incredible increase in volume served, given the scale 
of the ecosystem.

This growth is not entirely organic but, as noted, is likely 
caused by a deluge of spam packages published into 
open source registries. The below figure shows the yearly 
download view where this trend is clearly visible in npm. 
This anomaly might be causing issues with our linear 
regression and could lead to inflated estimates.

Java (Maven)
Through the first 7 months of 2024, 828 billion Java com\-
ponents were requested from the Maven Central Repos\-
itory. This continues the strong average request growth 
seen and is due to continue towards the second half of 
the year, with linear regression forecasting the ecosystem 
possibly reaching nearly 1\.5 trillion requests served.

Maven Central is one of the oldest open source ecosys\-
tems tracked, which can be seen from the amount of 
versions each project has published — an average of 28\. 
This is 75% more than the average across all ecosystems.

.NET (NuGet)
NuGet is the chosen ecosystem of the .NET family of lan\-
guages and continues to serve engineers working with 
the growing set of Microsoft technologies. The rate of 
growth has slowed down significantly in terms of down\-
load requests. This is not entirely unsurprising given the 
integrated nature of the .NET language core library.

JavaScript (npm)
npm continues to be the titan of the open source eco\-
systems when it comes to requests served, undergoing 
a significant growth spurt this year which is a significant 
anomaly from the usual pattern we observe. We can’t 
underscore enough that we believe this is because, in 
2023, npm was riddled with a deluge of components 
that could be classed as spam, all aiming to get payouts 
using the Tea.xyz crypto protocol. This has inflated their 
numbers and shows up in the massive uptick of request 
volume. Similarly project counts are distorted due to this 
spam. Although not unique to npm, the virtue of a low bar 
to publish and a high degree of adoption makes it the 
perfect target for such activity.

To say npm supports a titanic volume would be an 
understatement. We estimate the ecosystem to serve 
well over 4\.4 trillion requests by the end of 2024 — 
more than the entire volume of requests across all 
4 monitored ecosystems in 2023\.

Python (PyPI) 
Python is the fastest grower in both project creation 
and request volume. It continues to be fueled by the 
AI and cloud adoption boom as a favored language in 
both domains.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINSCALE OF OPEN SOURCEDifferentiating Software Vulnerabilities 
and Open Source Malware

To understand the risks in the software supply chain, it’s 
important to clarify the difference between Open Source 
Malware and Vulnerabilities. While the two concepts are 
related, they are completely different in terms of the type 
of risk they introduce into your organization, as well as the 
type of response that is required to mitigate said risk.

Software Vulnerability: A Flaw in the Code
A software vulnerability is akin to a flaw in code, much like 
a faulty lock on a door. Unlike malware, vulnerabilities are 
not intentional. Instead, they represent weaknesses in 
software components or projects.

Similar to how a faulty lock compromises the security of 
a building by allowing unauthorized access, a software 
vulnerability creates a gap in the software’s security 
perimeter. This gap becomes an entry point for intruders 
to exploit, gaining unapproved access to the system, 
application, or component.

Malware: Malicious Intent in Open Source
Malware, short for “malicious software,” poses a sig\-
nificant threat to open source software ecosystems. It 
encompasses a wide range of malicious programs, such 
as viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, and 
adware, all designed to gain unauthorized access to infor\-
mation or systems. In the software supply chain, malware 
is most often passed off as legitimate open source com\-
ponents or introduced to previously legitimate projects 
via takeovers.

With its various forms, malware’s primary purpose is to 
steal data, install harmful software, gain control of a net\-
work, or compromise software or hardware. Threat actors 
employ diverse distribution methods, such as infected 
email attachments, malicious websites, or compromised 
software downloads.

Malware in the software supply chain is designed to tar\-
get developer environments, like continuous integration 
systems and are commonly seen in ransomware attacks 
and sophisticated breaches. The only known cure is 
prevention and avoidance.

Open Source Ecosystem

Security vulnerabilities are a fact of life — as technology 
evolves and ages, it also requires maintenance. New issues 
are discovered at a rate over time, and thus it’s important to 
acknowledge that vulnerabilities appear all the time. A good 
analogy is to think software components age like milk, not 
fine wine (or a new analogy you’ll see when we talk more 
about risk, it’s more like steel than aluminum) — they don’t 
get better with age. They might be good for a long time, but 
when a vulnerability is discovered, it’s akin to spoiled milk — 
something that needs to be discarded quickly.

The challenge, of course, is the scale of new security 
vulnerabilities being discovered in the different ecosys\-
tems, as well as the scale of issues being discovered in 
the software you manage.

Organizational Challenges 
A few fundamental facts — last year we reported that the 
average Java application has about 150 open source 
components when counting both direct and transitive 
dependencies. On average, an application has 13 Critical or 
High severity security vulnerabilities being discovered each 
year. Depending on the size of the organization, the effort 
to remediate issues can vary wildly, from a few minutes to a 
few days, depending on the breaking changes needed to 
go from the current version to the non\-vulnerable one. 

Another challenge is the source of information about 
security vulnerabilities itself — in 2024, it has become evi\-
dent that relying on free sources of information is almost 
considered neglectful for any organization not specializ\-
ing in intelligence aggregation. 

For example, the National Vulnerability Database, the 
canonical catalog of known security vulnerabilities via the 
Common Vulnerability Enumeration System (“CVE”), had 
an outage early 2024 that caused a massive backlog of 
vulnerabilities being published. At the time of writing, this 
backlog of published vulnerabilities sits at 17,656 unpro\-
cessed issues. This meant that in Q1 of this year, nearly no 
new security issues were made available to the community.

The volume of security vulnerabilities discovered is 
growing in linear ratio with the growth rate of open 
source being invented and published. This is to be 
expected and is uncomfortable news for organizations 
seeking to manage them.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Open Source Malware \& Next 
Gen Supply Chain Attacks are Now 
Commonplace, Dangerous Business

The growth of downloads hides a disturbing fact — the 
continued extreme growth of malware, protestware, 
and intentionally hidden vulnerabilities passed on to the 
users. These types of packages are published not due 
to carelessness, but with purely malicious intent. Using 
open source as a medium of transport for malware isn’t 
new. However, traditional scanning tools struggle to iden\-
tify novel attacks, like we now see with malicious pack\-
ages, otherwise known as open source malware. These 
tools, while effective on known malware, are incapable of 
finding malware that has not yet been identified. 

Some have noble intentions, such as packages that pro\-
test wars around the world, while some hide extremely 
sinister motivations, including serious malware families 
and ransomware gangs that sell off their victims to the 
highest bidder. Every single one of them targets an often 
undefended prey: developers and automated build 
environments. 

A great example of a successful malicious campaign tar\-
geting developers is the Snowflake breach of 2024, where 
developers were specifically targeted with malware fami\-
lies that stole Snowflake authorization tokens. These were 
later used to breach over 160 organizations.

In our YOY monitoring, at the time of writing in August 
2024, we have logged 704,102 malicious open source 
packages — meaning in the last year, we’ve seen the 
number of malicious packages grow by 156% YOY. More 
troublingly, we observe via an anonymous survey con\-
ducted on more than 100k repositories that over 50% of 
unprotected instances surveyed have already fallen vic\-
tim and cached a piece of malware.

A sobering finding in this year’s data is that more than 
512k new pieces of malware have been introduced to the 
public binary repositories, with 65K of them being CVSS 
\>\= 7 since November 2023\. All of these represent yet 
another facet of Persistent Risk (read more about this in 
our Risk chapter), and bring a total data set of more than 
700k identified, malicious open source components.

Malware Types

FIGURE 2\.7
Malware Types Observed

As with ‘traditional’ malware, malware disguised as open 
source comes in many guises and types. What is not tra\-
ditional with open source malware is that it is executed 
entirely without developer interaction. Once the package 
is downloaded on the developers or build automation 
machine it is too late to avert disaster.

Potentially Unwanted Application \- 46\.4%
A majority of the malware we observe being spread in 
the open source ecosystem is what we call “Potentially 
Unwanted Application” or PUA, which represents func\-
tionality that is present in the software but not disclosed 
to the end user. Examples of this include protestware, 
anti\-work protests, and other uninvited functionalities. 
Though mostly innocent in practice, they represent a lack 
of process in getting packages and act as evidence of a 
hole in an organization’s open source defense. 

Phishing \- 13\.8%
These types of packages leverage attack methods such 
as dependency confusion to target organizations directly, 
pretending to be an internally developed package. They 
trick an organization’s build automation into downloading 
them and often drop malware as they are downloaded.

Data Exfiltration \- 13\.7%
Data exfiltration packages read a number of pieces of 
data found on the machine, such as environmental vari\-
ables, authentication tokens, password files and anything 
that might aid the assailant. Once collected, these files 
are uploaded to an external command and control server 
for future use.

Security Holding Package \- 12\.7%
These are packages that were found to be malicious, but 
got removed by the maintainers of the ecosystem and 
replaced by a holding package. Requires swift actions of 
the upstream maintainers to avert disaster.

Malware types observed.

PII Exfiltration \- 2\.8% 
A form of data exfiltration that targets Personally Identifiable 
Information like personal access tokens and information.

Backdoor \- 1\.9%
A package that installs a backdoor virus onto the machine 
that executes it. This backdoor will allow the attacker to 
access the tainted machine at a later date.

Crypto Stealer / Miner \- 1\.2%
These types of packages aim to make money fast by 
stealing any available cryptocurrency housed on the 
affected machine. This category also includes pack\-
ages that drop a crypto miner that hijacks the machine’s 
resources to mine cryptocurrency for the hacker’s benefit.

3232

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINSCALE OF OPEN SOURCEResearch Project \- 1\.2%
Some malware is simply a research project, either by a 
researcher or a whitehat hacker that contains malicious 
code but typically does not go so far as to breach the 
machine or steal information. They are often seen during 
penetration tests.

Dropper \- 0\.7%
As the name suggests, these types of packages drop 
an encrypted payload onto the affected machine, often 
a Remote Access Trojan that disappears from sight and 
allows hackers to return at a later date.

Other types of malicious packages \- 6\.8% 
The rest of the malicious packages discovered range from 
destructive ones aiming to corrupt the file system they 
launch on, to aiming to affect the code that a developer 
writes, often seen disguised as IDE or CI plugins. 

Traditional malware scanning solutions are unable to 
detect these novel forms of attack, leading developers 
and DevOps environments to be uniquely at risk. As the 
volume continues to grow so too will the clear and present 
danger facing organizations.

As we continue to document an overall rise in malicious attacks on open source ecosystems, 
the monitored 2023–2034 period has also seen more professional criminal campaigns 
emerge. The software supply chain lends itself well to the cybercriminal ecosystem — either 
as an initial access vector to Initial Access brokers or even as a means of distributing initial 
access malware for Advanced Persistent Threat groups.

RISK

In the 2015 edition of Sonatype’s State of the Software Supply Chain Report, we introduced the 
concept that “components age like milk, not wine.” For our 10th report, we’ve refined the metaphor: most components 
age more like steel, not aluminum. 

Today, software organizations resemble manufacturers, assembling products from hundreds of open source compo\-
nents. Like traditional manufacturing, the quality and longevity of components determine a product’s success. 

Choosing high\-quality components and committing 
to rigorous maintenance practices is the key to build\-
ing durable and secure software. Yet, despite known 
risks, many organizations ignore these best practices 
and use outdated components. This exposes them to 
vulnerabilities and defects that could be avoided with 
the right tools, data, and strategy.

Unlike industries where defective materials are 
swiftly removed, software manufacturers tolerate 
flawed parts from suppliers they haven’t vetted. A 
vigilant approach to supply chain management is 
essential to fully benefit from open source. Manufac\-
turers must prioritize quality, monitor emerging risks, 
and address risks throughout the software lifecycle to 
ensure long\-term security and reliability.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEVOLUTION OF OPEN SOURCE RISKOpen Source Software Quality

Vulnerabilities can make headlines, but our research shows 
that the best open source projects find and fix vulnerabil\-
ities quickly. Unfortunately, the majority of open source 
downloads are not of the fixed, non\-vulnerable version.

For example, our previous research found that \~96% 
of vulnerable downloaded open source components 
had a newer, non\-vulnerable version available at the 
time of the download. As part of our analysis this year, we 
reviewed and updated our algorithm completely. Despite 
our revisions, that number decreased by less than 1%, high\-
lighting a considerable deficit in changing open source con\-
sumption behavior, an issue we dive deep into in this year’s 
report’s Optimizing Efficiency \& Reducing Waste section. 

The magnitude of these figures is further punctu\-
ated when looking at Log4j downloads. When writing 
this report, 13% of all Log4j downloads were still of 

a vulnerable version, even though a non\-breaking, 
non\-vulnerable version existed. While this is significantly 
better than the 30\-35% we saw in our last report — nearly 
three years since the Log4Shell vulnerability made head\-
lines — that number should be much closer to 0\.

Despite Log4Shell being one of the most well\-known 
vulnerabilities encountered in the last ten years, devel\-
opment teams continue to introduce risk through known 
vulnerabilities regardless of available fixes. Though, we 
are happy to see the decrease, which shows that this 
message is reaching some audiences. 

Blaming open source alone is like pointing one finger 
while three point back. While vulnerabilities exist, their 
impact lies not in sheer numbers but in timely fixes and 
the persistence of unfixed issues and risks. More import\-
ant than the number of vulnerabilities is how quickly a 
vulnerability is fixed and the number of remaining unfixed 
vulnerabilities, as these factor into Persistent Risk.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEVOLUTION OF OPEN SOURCE RISKPersistent Risk

Persistent Risk is new this year. Based on our research, 
we found that risk is deeply impacted by ongoing expo\-
sure to vulnerabilities that remain unresolved over time. 
To support this, we defined Persistent Risk using two pri\-
mary factors: Unfixed and Corrosive Risk.

• Unfixed Risk refers to vulnerabilities within software 
components that have been identified but have yet 
to be addressed and, in many cases, will never be 
addressed. It also incorporates the time it takes to 
remediate a vulnerability. These known vulnerabilities 
pose a continuous threat, leaving the software open to 
exploitation.

• Corrosive Risk impacts current and historical 

releases. Like Unfixed Risk, corrosive risk considers 
the time needed to resolve these vulnerabilities. 

FIGURE 3\.2 
Persistent Vuln Risk \= Unfixed Risk \+ Corrosive Risk

However, corrosive risk also incorporates the delay in 
discovering vulnerabilities in old versions. The longer 
it takes to find and resolve these issues, the more the 
software is exposed to potential attacks. 

When combined, these two factors create Persistent Risk — 
a risk that remains unfixed and corrodes the software’s 
security integrity over time.

Just as corrosion slowly eats away at the metal, a long 
time to discover and fix increases the corrosive potential 
of Persistent Risk. The longer vulnerabilities go undis\-
covered and unfixed, the more they weaken the software, 
making it increasingly susceptible to breaches and failures. 
This corrosive potential is not just about the immediate risk 
of a known vulnerability but also about how the delayed 
discovery allows the risk to compound, leading to a grad\-
ual and often unnoticed security degradation over time.

The image above shows an analysis of Persistent Risk.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEVOLUTION OF OPEN SOURCE RISKPersistent Risk \= Unfixed Risk \+ Corrosive Risk. 
As time increases without addressing vulnerabilities, the 
risk becomes more ingrained, corroding defenses and lead\-
ing to a fundamentally compromised state of security. This is 
why promptly addressing vulnerabilities is essential — delay 
leads to corrosion, which can lead to catastrophic failure.

Again, a finger may appear pointed at open source soft\-
ware projects; however, our analysis indicates that the 
best projects will address most vulnerabilities quickly. 
Those projects are also more likely to improve their secu\-
rity posture and software supply chain best practices using 
tools like those in the Open Source Security Foundation’s 
Scorecard. Our conclusion is that Persistent Risk is driven 
more by open source consumption practices than by an 
inherent quality issue with open source software.

Open Source Consumption

Over the past decade, poor open source consumption has 
emerged as the clearest indication of risk in the software 
supply chain. As we now focus on Persistent Risk, the role 
of open source consumption has only grown. 

T H R E E FACTO R S I N F LU E N C I N G T H E 

H E A LT H O F S O F T WA R E S U P P LY C H A I N S

Choice is determined by a software 
manufacturer’s selection of open 
source software.

Complacency becomes a risk when 
software manufacturers fail to update 
\& manage dependencies. 

Contamination occurs when open source 
malware or malicious packages infiltrate 
the software supply chain.

Persistent risk is driven more by open source 
consumption practices than by an inherent 
quality issue with open source software.

However, defining risky behaviors and helping organiza\-
tions identify low\-quality components remains challenging.

This year, we partnered with Tidelift, the CHAOSS Project, 
and various open source software community members 
to better understand how three specific factors of open 
source consumption influence the health and security of 
software supply chains.

• Choice: Choice is determined by a software manufac\-

turer’s selection of open source software. Making good 
choices when choosing components is critical, mean\-
ing software manufacturers should prioritize avoiding 
projects with Persistent Risk to ensure a robust and 
secure software supply chain.

• Complacency: Complacency becomes a risk when soft\-
ware manufacturers fail to properly update and maintain 
their open source software by managing dependencies. 
This negligence leaves them vulnerable to corrosion, as 
vulnerabilities persist and accumulate over time.

• Contamination: Contamination occurs when open 
source malware or malicious packages infiltrate the 
software supply chain, often targeting the development 
infrastructure. Poor choice and complacency are high\-
risk consumption factors that increase the likelihood 
of contamination entering software supply chains. This 
underscores the need for heightened awareness and 
proactive measures to protect against these threats.

Continue reading to learn how these three risk factors 
affect the analysis of 7 million open source projects.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEVOLUTION OF OPEN SOURCE RISKCan We Minimize Persistent Risk

For those seven million open source software projects, 
we collected data at the component level and classified 
each component into distinct groups based on their 
usage in enterprise applications. 

For our analysis, we considered two groups: core and 
peripheral components. We took a representative and 
statistically significant sample from each group, then 
identified which key metrics had the potential to minimize 
Persistent Risk. 

We also categorized these components into three spe\-
cialized groups. The key difference between the core 
and peripheral component groups and the specialized 
groups is exclusivity – components can only belong to 
one of the core or peripheral groups, while the specialized 
groups are inclusive. A component can simultaneously 
be part of SBOM, Foundation Support, and Paid Support. 

FIGURE 3\.3 
Specialized Groups by Usage

The diagram shows how the specialized groups intersect with the usage groups.

Components
Rarely, if ever, found in

Each specialized group is defined by distinct practices 
that influence how an open\-source project provides its 
components.

• SBOM — Components published with at least one 
SBOM. Projects releasing an SBOM demonstrate 
responsiveness to the emergent need for better soft\-
ware supply chain management practices, and we 
hypothesized that this points to better security practices.

• Foundation Supported — Components that are part 
of a project supported by a foundation like Apache, 
Eclipse, or The Cloud Native Computing Foundation 
(CNCF). Projects under a foundation receive guidance 
and are part of a larger ecosystem with established 
best practices, and we hypothesized that this points to 
better security practices.

• Paid Support — Commercial organizations, such as 
Tidelift, pay the open source project maintainer. The 
components are part of projects that receive funding and 
are given the resources to address maintenance needs 
that otherwise might not get attention. We hypothesized 
that this also includes better security practices.

By analyzing projects through these lenses, we better 
understand how different factors contribute to or mit\-
igate the risks associated with open source software 
consumption. This approach underscores the importance 
of selecting the right projects, maintaining vigilance in 
dependency management, and avoiding contamination 
to minimize the long\-term risks to software supply chains.

the number of components actively 
downloaded and used in software, of the 
more than 7 million available

Choice 

A key goal of this year’s report is to define what consti\-
tutes high\-quality open source components. This effort 
stems from a core belief that the principles guiding sup\-
ply chain best practices are equally applicable to the 
software supply chain — a belief that remains unchanged, 
though our understanding has deepened.

One of the most striking insights came from our analysis 
of discoverability, which revealed the vast landscape 
of open source projects. Despite the seemingly infinite 
number of components available (more than seven mil\-
lion), only a small percentage — 10\.5% — are actively cho\-
sen ( just over 762,000\). This disparity between the pop\-
ularity and usage of open source projects underscores 
the significant noise developers must sift through when 
choosing a component.

We also discovered that while it’s challenging to pinpoint 
a single, definitive marker of high quality, there are key 
indicators that collectively paint a clearer picture of what 
quality is not. While no universal standard or indicator 
exists today for consumers of open source software to rely 
on, we identified a set of key heuristics. We tested them 
against our data and analysis. These markers are designed 
to help software developers make informed choices 
regarding open source software projects (suppliers).

1\. Popularity is important: Aligning usage with the mass 
of other users can be a helpful starting point. We found 
that popular components have 63% more vulnerabil\-
ities identified, address 54% more, and fix them 32% 
faster (\~50 fewer days). While this is a good heuristic, it 
is not a foolproof quality measure in isolation.

2\. Active communities manage software quality better: 
Our analysis showed that active project communities 
often correlate with better\-managed software quality. 
However, this relationship does not necessarily reduce 
Persistent Risk.

FIGURE 3\.4 
Open Source Developer Choice

This pie chart shows developers’ challenge when choosing among millions of 
components; nearly 90% will be noise.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEVOLUTION OF OPEN SOURCE RISK3\. SBOMs demonstrate good supply chain practices: 

Projects that publish a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) 
make supply chain management more manageable and 
tend to exhibit lower Persistent Risk. Projects investing 
in good supply chain practices, such as early adoption of 
SBOMs, produce higher\-quality software.

5\. Stars and forks shed a light on community engagement: 
Our analysis confirmed that the number of stars and 
forks on an open source repository correlates with the 
level of community engagement. However, this metric 
alone may not reliably indicate the overall quality or 
Persistent Risk of a project.

4\. OpenSSF Scorecard could help reduce Persistent Risk: 
The OpenSSF Scorecard was assessed for its correla\-
tion with Persistent Risk. While it provides valuable 
insights into various security practices, its effective\-
ness as a standalone predictor of low Persistent Risk 
remains inconclusive and requires further exploration.

As we refined this list, it became clear that while there are 
heuristics that point towards quality, every measurement 
should ultimately be assessed against risk. But risk itself 
is more complex than the mere existence of a vulnera\-
bility. Many projects have vulnerabilities, but how they 
respond to them matters. 

Based on our definition of Persistent risk, two metrics 
are critical: fix rate and time to remediate across usage 
and specialized groups.

on Open Source Quality

Our analysis highlights a compelling trend: open source projects supported by recognized foundations, such as 
the Apache Software Foundation, Eclipse, and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, consistently outperform 
non\-foundation\-supported projects across several key quality metrics.

Security Practices: Foundation projects are 
4\.1x more likely to have formal vulnerability 
reporting and have a 94% higher fix rate, 
showing proactive security measures.

Community Engagement: Foundation 
projects have 265% more forks and 162% 
more stargazers on GitHub, reflecting 
broader interest and quicker updates.

Vulnerability Management: Foundation 
projects resolve security issues 264 days 
faster on average, minimizing risk exposure.

Release Cadence: With 72% fewer days 
since their last update, foundation projects 
show better maintenance, while non\- 
foundation projects are more prone to 
becoming obsolete or reaching EOL.

Issue Management: While foundation 
projects have more active issues, they close 
1\.8x more, ensuring sustained momentum 
and backlog reduction.

Code Freshness: Non\-foundation projects 
use dependencies that are, on average, 
10 libyears older, increasing the risk from 
outdated components.

FIGURE 3\.9
Simulated 1 Year Impact of Unfixed 
\& Time to Remediate on Vulnerabilities

This chart displays the Average Unfixed Vulnerabilities increasing in severity.

This graph shows the average number of vulnerabilities.

Next, we evaluated these metrics across the identified 
groups to simulate a practical example of how Persistent 
Risk is driven by the number of unfixed vulnerabilities and 
the time (days) it takes to fix them. 

In our data, SBOMs had a higher incidence of vulnera\-
bilities, yet their ability to quickly address and fix most of 
those vulnerabilities makes a significant difference. 

The chart above demonstrates how unfixed vulnerabili\-
ties can grow exponentially when not addressed. Consid\-
ering the scale over the ten years we’ve been producing 
the State of the Software Supply Chain Report, this shows 
the potential for exponential growth.

In the next simulation, we’ve normalized based on the 
average vulnerability counts we identified for a compo\-
nent in a specific usage or specialized group.

Corrosiveness impacts long\-term security and stability in 
low\-usage component groups. This underscores the impor\-
tance of choosing and maintaining components wisely to 
mitigate the corrosive impact on the software supply chain. 

Though we’ve demonstrated the impact of unfixed 
vulnerabilities and the time it takes to fix them, seeing 
the benefit of open source projects’ hard work requires 
proper dependency management. In other words, a fixed 
vulnerability is technically unfixed until an upgrade. 

I N C E N T I V E S PAY O F F
Paid maintainers show a clear lead in security practices. Projects with paid support are nearly three times more likely to 
have a comprehensive security policy formed through best practices like those verified through the OpenSSF Scorecard 
project, suggesting better vulnerability identification processes. At the same time, non\-paid packages tend to accumulate 
more vulnerabilities, with paid packages having only a third of the unfixed vulnerabilities seen in non\-paid ones. Addition\-
ally, components with paid support resolve outstanding vulnerabilities up to 45% faster and have half the vulnerabilities 
overall. This data highlights that incentivized maintainers produce more secure and efficient outcomes. This is consistent 
with the 2024 Tidelift State of the Open Source Maintainer Report that paid maintainers implement 55% more critical 
security and maintenance practices than unpaid maintainers.

corrosive nature of Persistent Risk takes hold, leading to 
gradual and eventual decay. 

Complacency is hard to spot, and dependency manage\-
ment isn’t only about failing to upgrade. Upgrading to a 
still\-vulnerable dependency can be just as damaging. It’s 
like replacing rusty steel with equally corroded material. 
Once corrosion sets in, fixing it becomes costly. Fortu\-
nately, our findings show this decay is entirely avoidable.

In our analysis, we first assessed how many enterprise 
application dependencies had yet to be upgraded within 
a year. The findings were sobering: 80% were unman\-
aged and remained outdated. Delving deeper, we found 
that managed and updated dependencies still used 3\.4% 
of components with a vulnerability. Only 0\.5% of compo\-
nents were without a better choice because they had no 
fixed version available (no path forward or NPF). 

Ultimately, the highest\-quality components will reduce 
risk and fix most of their vulnerabilities, and they do so 
quickly. However, making the right choice is just one 
aspect of mitigating Persistent Risk. Proactive depen\-
dency management is essential to avoid or significantly 
reduce this risk effectively. Unfortunately, our data pres\-
ents a sobering reality, indicating software manufacturers 
are plagued by complacency.

Complacency

Complacency is generally defined as a false sense of 
security or neglect, where one is unaware or unconcerned 
about potential dangers. In open source software, com\-
placency manifests as the failure to update and maintain 
dependencies properly, akin to neglecting rusting steel. 

Open source components, like steel, rust over time. Thus, 
maintenance is critical to ensure durability and structural 
integrity. When software manufacturers neglect their

of enterprise application dependencies 
were unmanaged and remained outdated 
within a year.

Excluding complacent behavior, the risk rate could be 
lowered to 0\.5% associated with NPF. However, for 
complacent dependency management, the risk rate is 
seven times higher at a staggering 3\.6% of components 
that became vulnerable but were not updated or were 
updated to another vulnerable version, highlighting the 
critical difference between active and passive depen\-
dency management. The following diagram exemplifies 
how complacent behavior results in 4 vulnerabilities that 
could have been avoided.

These findings highlight how quickly risks can accumu\-
late without proactive management. All open source 
or commercial software will eventually have bugs that 

FIGURE 3\.11
Libyears

evolve into vulnerabilities; hence, the metaphor: compo\-
nents age like steel, not aluminum. There is a silver lining, 
though, albeit short\-lived.

For the components described above, those that exhib\-
ited complacent risk, 95% were avoidable by the end of 
the period. In other words, for almost 95% of components 
that had a vulnerability, within a year, there was at least 
one newer, non\-vulnerable version available. We also 
know that many open source projects address vulnerabil\-
ities much faster. 

To better understand a project’s susceptibility to cor\-
rosion, we analyzed “libyears,” a metric that captures 
the cumulative age of a component’s dependencies. 
The risk intensifies with End\-of\-Life (EOL) components, 
which no longer receive updates, leading to the gradual 
breakdown of software integrity. Our findings indicate 
that complacent dependency management, especially 
involving EOL components, results in significantly more 
vulnerabilities, steadily eroding security posture and 
underscoring the need for proactive management.

While libyears increase with dependency count, there is significant variation in how outdated dependencies are, even for similar\-sized applications.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEVOLUTION OF OPEN SOURCE RISKLibyears reveal how outdated dependencies can harbor 
significant risks. Even when choosing the latest com\-
ponent version, it’s critical to assess the freshness of 
its dependencies. Higher libyears correlate with more 

vulnerabilities, particularly in larger applications. 
This reinforces the importance of vigilance, especially as 
EOL components present severe risks by leaving vulnera\-
bilities unaddressed, further weakening software security.

FIGURE 3\.12
More EOL Components per Application 
Lead to More Security Vulnerabilities

More EOL components per application correlate with a higher number of 
security vulnerabilities.

FIGURE 3\.13
EOL Components Signal Broader 
Vulnerabilities in Non\-EOL Packages

Applications with more EOL components still show higher vulnerabilities 
in non\-EOL packages, suggesting EOL presence reflects broader mainte\-
nance issues.

Our analysis of over 20,000 enterprise applications 
shows that reliance on EOL components strongly indi\-
cates increased security vulnerabilities. Simply removing 
these components often offers minimal improvement, 
revealing that the corrosion of complacent behavior runs 
deeper, affecting the entire software framework. Vulner\-
abilities aren’t limited to EOL components, and managing 
only EOL components is insufficient. Still, the presence of 
EOL components indicates the lack of dependency man\-
agement, and like EOL components are allowed to exist, 
so are vulnerable versions of other components. Routine 
upgrades alone aren’t enough; without a strategic, proac\-
tive approach to dependency management, corrosion will 
continue to undermine software integrity.

Our analysis of over 20,000 enterprise 
applications shows that reliance on EOL 
components strongly indicates increased 
security vulnerabilities

When considering Persistent Risk, complacent depen\-
dency management compounds the corrosive aspects 
of Persistent Risk. When not addressed, corrosion can 
erode even the most robust systems if not actively man\-
aged. And, as corrosion silently compromises software 
integrity, the risks escalate, paving the way for contamina\-
tion. For software manufacturers that fail to minimize Per\-
sistent Risk through informed choices, contamination risk 
— the new frontier of attacks — moves beyond Persistent 
Risk, posing a critical, new threat many software manufac\-
turers have yet to realize.

Open source malware acts as a contaminant in the digital 
supply chain, undermining the security and stability of 
systems and exposing them to significant risks.

To better understand contamination, consider head\-
line\-grabbing attacks like NotPetya, Octopus Scanner 
(NetBeans), and SunBurst (SolarWinds). These incidents 
occurred despite the proliferation of malware scanning 
tools, highlighting a critical gap in modern information 
security practices.

The XZ Utils incident exposed the dangers of neglected 
open source projects, which become easy targets with\-
out proper care. While a vigilant developer averted disas\-
ter, the core issue remains unresolved. It’s only a matter 
of time before another neglected project faces attack. 
This risk is not theoretical — it’s an urgent threat with 
potentially far\-reaching consequences.

Open source malware targets anyone using open 
source software, but teams making poor choices and 
neglecting proper dependency management practices 
are at even greater risk. Once again, complacency plays 
a significant role here, as many security teams need a 
deeper understanding of the unique challenges posed 
by open source malware. 

Traditional scanning tools effectively identify and prevent 
known malware but struggle with novel attacks, especially 
those embedded in malicious open source packages. While 
these tools can catch established threats, they often miss 
the hidden dangers within open source components, par\-
ticularly when the malicious code is deliberately designed 
to evade detection. This limitation underscores the need 
for more advanced security measures that can address the 
unique challenges posed by sophisticated, elusive attacks.

FIGURE 3\.14
Malware Introduced to Public Binary 
Repositories Over Time

Open source malware has spiked over the past 3 months.

As part of our analysis, we examined 512,000 pieces of 
open source malware that had been introduced into pub\-
lic binary repositories since November of 2023\. While the 
majority of malware is of medium risk, a substantial por\-
tion (almost 17%) poses critical security risks.

When comparing a sample of 84k components, 42k 
of which are core and 42k peripheral, we found that periph\-
eral components were 25x more likely to contain mal\-
ware. The peripheral packages are less commonly used in 
enterprise applications but target automated builds or sce\-
narios where a component is set to pull the latest version. 

Open source malware targets innovators, exploiting soft\-
ware manufacturers with poor consumption practices. 
This year’s analysis shows many are vulnerable, whether 
by failing to equip developers with the right tools or rely\-
ing on complacent approaches like automatic upgrades. 
Malware doesn’t discriminate, and current scanning 
methods don’t guarantee risk reduction. The conse\-
quences of persistent contamination remain severe.

Efficiency \& Reducing Waste

This year we estimate open source downloads to be over 6\.6 trillion — the scale of open source is 
unfathomable. We also know that commercial state\-of\-the\-art software is built from as much as 90% open source code, 
including hundreds of discrete libraries in a single application. While use of OSS accelerates application development 
cycles and reduces expenses, it also introduces threat vectors in the form of vulnerabilities and intellectual property (IP) 
risk from restrictive and reciprocal licenses.

Managing these OSS risks in DevOps organizations, with any type of success, must involve efficient security policies and 
practices that are capable of keeping pace with the evolution and addition of new OSS libraries in the accelerated devel\-
opment environment leading to rapidly changing risk profile. 

Previously we talked about the Persistent Risk and how open source con\-
sumption factors into creating that risk. We also talked about complacency 
within dependency management — and found that 80% of enterprise applica\-
tion dependencies were not upgraded within a year. We also know from past 
analysis that of those versions that do get upgraded, 69% had a better choice. 
And, that 95% of all vulnerable versions used to begin with had a non\-vulnera\-
ble fix available and 62% of consumers used an avoidable vulnerable version. 

These sobering statistics led us to where we are now — diving deep into how 
organizations can change their consumption behaviors to optimize risk miti\-
gation efforts and reduce waste, especially waste that might occur in targeting 
lower priority risks.

Applications Have Sizable Risk

As a result, organizations need more time to remediate the 
vulnerabilities. The more time you take, the higher the risk. 

The average application has around 180 open source 
components — that’s an increase from around 150 from 
which we found last year. All of these packages, when left 
unmanaged can be a source of risk and as we saw in pre\-
vious chapters of this report — that risk is only growing. It 
won’t be if you get breached, but when. 

There is no denying the data shows the larger the appli\-
cation, the larger the risk. It should come as no surprise 
that as application size grows, so does the number of 
dependencies. The sheer size of the code base and com\-
plexity of large applications makes it harder to manage. 

FIGURE 4\.1
Average Number of Packages per Application

This chart shows the distribution of application dependency size. 
Small: up to 25 dependencies; Medium: 26 to 150 dependencies; 
Large: 151 to 400 dependencies; X\-Large: 401 or more dependencies.

However, it became abundantly clear that there is no 
‘small’ application that is trivial to manage. Further, our 
data shows that most applications are in fact large appli\-
cations — around 40%. So, there is no organization that 
doesn’t have to contend with this problem. No matter 
the size of an application — whether you only have 25 
dependencies or you have 400 or 800 dependencies 
(which is not abnormal) — it is an unmanageable manual 
workload. You can and must gain efficiency across all 
applications regardless of their size, especially as the 
industry moves more towards microservices and mod\-
ularizing applications, which will mean smaller applica\-
tions. Optimizing management of 1,000 small applications 
is just as beneficial as optimizing 1 large application. 

So, how do enterprises get a handle on this massive issue 
that is not only causing increasing risk to them and their cus\-
tomers, but is also wasting an incredible amount of time? We 
must first understand two interrelated key concepts: 

• Efficiency Hurdle: Development time is limited with 

little or no allocation in schedules for remediation tasks 
or dependency upgrade research. Stopping builds and 
slowing down pipelines to review risks due to vulner\-
abilities manually is impractical and goes against the 
flow of DevOps, frustrating teams as a result. It also 
frustrates developers, causing intense friction, which is 
why organizations must prioritize reducing waste. 

• Reduce Waste: The efficiency hurdle is a solvable 

problem. Enterprises can create efficiency and thus 
reduce waste, by optimizing remediation via a com\-
bined approach of an enterprise\-scale SCA tool, highly 
accurate component intelligence, and effective depen\-
dency management practices.

What to Look for in an SCA Tool

FIGURE 4\.2
Corrected Version Information

Integrate for effective but non intrusive 
software composition analysis
Fixing vulnerabilities is a huge time drain on development 
cycles. It will be faster if vulnerability detection is integrated 
in development environments or CI/CD pipelines. The right 
tool will provide context for the expected functionality of 
the component, so developers can make informed deci\-
sions on deciding the best version to use in real\-time.

We’ve all now heard the concept of Shifting Left or mov\-
ing the remediation as close to the beginning of the 
development cycle. While we still agree with this, we’ve 
found you must go even further — you must review 
dependences on a continuous basis, there is no begin\-
ning or end. Reviewing dependencies and remediation 
needs to be incorporated into the regular flow of devel\-
opment, shifting it into development rather than at ‘test’ 
or ‘release’ time. But, to be successful it needs to be 
much more efficient than it is now, since it’s now being 
done more frequently and can disrupt the development 
pace. This is the only way to reduce downstream and 
upstream effects, rework and wasting developer time.

For an SCA tool to be successful, it must be integrated 
within the CI/CD pipelines and provide context for the 
expected functionality of the component, so developers 
can make informed decisions on deciding the best ver\-
sion to use. If your tool does this, you’re one step closer 
to reducing waste. 

Demand High\-Quality Open Source 
Component Intelligence 
Reliable component intelligence is the foundation of 
efficient risk remediation and dependency management. 
Component intelligence depends upon the quality of the 
underlying vulnerability data.

This pie chart shows that 92% of public vulnerability information had a version 
correction after deeper review.

There are two main contributing factors of high quality 
vulnerability data to look for:

1\. Scoring the vulnerabilities in a consistent and repeat\-

able manner, in line with industry standards

2\. Comprehensive coverage of the correlation to libraries 

and versions affected by the vulnerability

We’ve found that 92% of crowdsourced or publicly 
available vulnerability data needed a correction once 
detailed security research took place that more accu\-
rately correlated the source of the vulnerability to 
affected versions of the libraries.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINOPTIMIZING EFFICIENCY \& REDUCING WASTEFIGURE 4\.3
Score Corrected Aggregations

This bar chart depicts public vulnerability score corrections by score severity, 10 through 1\.

While public data is often accurate for a single version, it 
tends to be wrong when it comes to multiple versions — 
usually because the version range is incorrect. This creates 
a false sense of security, as you might assume, “the version 
I’m using isn’t affected.” But that’s often not true; the security 
researcher simply didn’t review all versions thoroughly. It’s 
important to understand that while the version mentioned 
in a public advisory is typically correct, many other versions 
haven’t been reviewed or validated at all.

We dug deeper on accuracy of scoring and found that 
69% of vulnerabilities that were initially scored below 7 
were corrected to 7 or higher, and 16\.5% were corrected 
to 9 and higher. This creates what we’re calling surprise 
risk and a false sense of comfort that you’re not at risk. 

To reiterate, incorrectly scored low vulnerabilities lead to 
emergency reactive work when the true threat is realized. 

The surprise reactive work and surprise risk negatively 
impacts the flow of development, leading to inefficiency, 
in addition to a false sense of security that could result 
in a breach or service interruption. Vulnerabilities 
detected after a serious breach or incident demand a 
higher resolution time, in addition to the lack of trust and 
endangering lives, in extreme cases.

The converse is incorrectly scored high vulnerabilities 
which diverts development capacity to remediate, taking 
away precious time that could be spent on true high prior\-
ity vulnerabilities that could lead to serious impacts.

It must be emphasized that the component intelligence 
built into your SCA tool must give accurate vulnerability 
data and avoid wasting development capacity, by target\-
ing remediation efforts on high priority vulnerabilities.

Different ecosystems have a different number of depen\-
dencies and could directly affect the size of your appli\-
cation. A general perception is that Java and JavaScript 
have a lot of dependencies, while other ecosystems 
are more manageable. This could cause complacency 
among the developers using non\-Java ecosystems, 
based on the false understanding that fewer dependen\-
cies mean fewer vulnerabilities or easier to manage.

Our data actually shows that the PyPI ecosystem (the 
Python ecosystem which tends to have low dependen\-
cies) has more vulnerabilities per package as compared 

to other ecosystems. Enterprises cannot rest on using 
“low\-dependency” languages because even when you 
think you’re using a low dependency — or lower average 
number of components — you’re still very much at risk 
and need to practice efficient dependency manage\-
ment, thus you need a good SCA tool that covers a wide 
breadth of ecosystems.

Further, most enterprises are using more than one eco\-
system within their application portfolio, underscoring 
the importance of having an SCA tool that supports 
comprehensive ecosystems.

Risk based prioritization is essential to minimize the time 
spent on remediating vulnerabilities. There are several 
approaches to how an organization can assess and prior\-
itize risks to optimize the remediation process. Some of 
them include:

• Performing Reachability Analysis to determine what 

actual components in the dependency chain are being 
called by the applications and are vulnerable.

• Assessing risks due to vulnerabilities that are exploit\-
able in the runtime environment of the application.

Reachability Analysis is an optimization approach to achiev\-
ing a near\-zero risk scenario in a limited amount of time. 
Reachability involves detecting vulnerable method signa\-
tures in the execution paths of an application (call graph), 
regardless of whether it is directly called from the applica\-
tion or through other OSS libraries. Teams can target their 
remediation efforts towards these reached vulnerabilities.

However, the effectiveness of this kind of prioritization 
greatly depends on a combination of the following factors:

• The accuracy of the call graph generated

• The accuracy of the CVE scores being targeted for 

remediation (see the importance quality data)

• CWE (determination of the impact if the vulnerability 

manifests itself in an exploitable manner)

Targeting remediation of only vulnerabilities detected 
after Reachability Analysis, having high CVE scores only 
(9 or 10\) without considering the CWEs could create a 
false sense of security.

All declared vulnerabilities may not manifest themselves 
as exploitable in a given runtime environment. An appli\-
cation’s runtime environment (public SaaS, distributed for 
customers to run and operate, having access to sensitive 
information etc.) could be determinant in the priority of its 
remediation. Knowledge of declared CWE and its accu\-
racy, including a thorough analysis of base level weak\-
nesses, variant weaknesses and composite weaknesses 
(a set of weaknesses that are reachable consecutively 
in order to produce an exploitable vulnerability), is a key 
factor to avoiding such risks.

Aligned with Cybersecurity 
Compliance Requirements
For organizations serving the federal sector, or serving 
other organizations that support the federal sector, main\-
taining an optimal security posture is a hard requirement 
to stay in compliance with FISMA policies. This is achieved 
by remediating all “high” and “critical” vulnerabilities in the 
production environment.

Features like continuous monitoring and reporting 
offered by SCA tools provide real\-time insights into the 
severity of vulnerabilities, as they are discovered at 
various stages of the development cycle. Developers 
can target “high” and “critical” vulnerabilities and avoid 
spending time remediating others to stay in compliance.

Network exploits could occur only if the application is 
meant to run on public WAN/LAN or Internet. 

Applications processing sensitive data such as PII,

accidental exposure due compromised network security 
or malicious attempts to gain access.

Generally, licensing tends to lie outside of developer or 
security teams interest. Swept away by the creative and 
innovation waves, developers use the latest and most 
popular components available to stay ahead of the curve. 
Neglecting open source licenses (based on assumptions 
that it is open source and free to use) is a huge business 
risk. With laws and litigations coming in later, organiza\-
tions could get into years of dispute and suffer financial 
setbacks involving fines and loss of revenue.

Open source licensing issues, if investigated at all, will 
generally not show up before release cycles due to the 
effort involved. In the absence of an SCA tool, the pro\-
cess to review OSS licenses is manual and time consum\-
ing. It could involve reviews done by legal teams, which

Projects with One or More License Changes

This pie chart shows the percentage of projects that had 1 or more license 
changes through the version history.

Total releases with a license

puts drag on external teams and resources. As a common 
practice, most organizations conduct OSS license com\-
pliance reviews once, just before a production release 
to save resources, which is very late in the development 
cycle and can ultimately create more waste.

Licenses can change from version to version
A typical open source project has an overarching license, 
which might not apply to all individual files under the proj\-
ect. As contributions to an open source project increase, 
individual pieces of code can have different licenses, 
which could impact the project downstream.

Some vendor\-owned open source projects can also be 
relicensed to restrict usage or better control, for exam\-
ple, Terraform, previously Mozilla Public License v2\.0, 
changed to Business Source License (BSL) v1\.1; Elas\-
ticSearch, previously Apache2\.0 License, changed to 
non\-open source dual license based on SSPL; and Redis, 
previously Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) License, 
changed to Redis Source Available License.

The BSL license also gives the vendor the right to change 
license further down the road with short or no notice.

Data at left depicts the magnitude of license changes 
tracked for multiple projects. 

Although the overall license changes appear to be 6% of all 
release versions, the remediation tasks being more man\-
ual in nature could set release dates back unexpectedly. 
Reviewing candidate upgrade versions requires manual 
checks, causing delays and sometimes no upgrades at all.

Open Source Compliance Legal Review Time 

This bar chart shows the sum of the unique licenses sets per project (not

This bar chart illustrates efficiency gains in legal review time by comparing 
duration without and with accurate and comprehensive legal data.

An SCA tool with a built\-in license feature and accurate 
OSS legal compliance database can identify potential 
compliance and legal issues immediately — decreasing 
review time by 2,470%.

Teams can detect license changes which can occur from 
version to version for a component by reviewing the 
SCA reports. If configured correctly, it can detect license 
changes early in the development cycle, allowing suffi\-
cient time for linked manual remediation processes (esca\-
late, find forked projects with non\-restrictive licenses or 
adapt usage of commercially available licenses.)

Why Dependency Management Needs to be Much 
More than “Just Update to the Latest Version”
Simply put, the latest version of a component may not be 
the best version to use. A common practice for avoiding 
known security issues is to upgrade to the latest version 
of a component, to the point where this upgrade step is 

often automated. There is the possibility of the license 
being more restrictive than the currently used versions 
license, introducing new business risks. 

It can allow setting context\-sensitive license policies that 
are in compliance with the application context, and flag 
violations within the development cycle.

Since many OSS licenses come into effect based on 
the application’s production environment (distributed, 
hosted, or internal), compliance issues may not arise until 
a release. An SCA tool can allow setting license policies 
to flag non\-compliance at various stages in the SDLC 
(pre\-release or release.)

Backed by accurate and trusted OSS license data, 
organizations can review attribution reports, and review 
license obligations to stay compliant.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Best Practices 

in Software Supply Chain Management

Every dollar spent on software development demands budget justification. This complicates risk 
management. The open source world is always changing, with new risks appearing daily through rapid innovation. Tradi\-
tional scanning tools are unable to accurately and promptly detect new potential malware. Most organizations struggle 
with timely risk management due to a lack of adequate security controls and discipline to enforce better open source 
component choices along with the pace of necessary security updates. This results in considerable difficulty in achieving 
and maintaining an optimal Mean Time To Remediate.

Developers feel less encouraged or incentivized to adapt to 
a security\-savvy mindset while developing software using 
open source packages due to a lack of proactive guid\-
ance from tools, available security data insights, or implied 
security processes. Further, the alarming increase in open 
source malware and the use of open source downloads as 
a vehicle for malware distribution is also highly concerning. 
Amid constant backdoors, ransomware, and emerging 
threats, security struggled with manual oversight of engi\-
neering, whose development teams, despite being the pri\-
mary risk source, often ignored security concerns.

However, the expanding risk spectrum and surge in 
open source components don’t fully excuse the failure to 
choose high\-quality components, update them promptly, 
or proactively defend against malware attacks. 

Most organizations struggle with 
timely risk management due to a 
lack of adequate security controls 
and discipline to enforce better 
open source component choices 
along with the pace of necessary 
security updates.

Best Practices

Our findings reinforce the need for software manufactur\-
ers to approach open source consumption with diligence. 
With the right tools, processes, and best practices, man\-
aging these risks and ensuring the security and reliability 
of software supply chains becomes possible and efficient. 

Informed Selection of Open Source 
Components:

• Prioritize components that demonstrate active and 

responsive communities. These components are more 
likely to address vulnerabilities quickly and maintain a 
higher standard of code quality.

• Integrate metrics like latency (the average time to vul\-
nerability discovery) into your risk assessment frame\-
works to better understand and mitigate the long\-term 
impact of complacency.

Address the Human Factor in Risk 
Assessment:

• Educate your development teams on the cognitive 

biases that can lead to poor risk assessment, such as 
overestimating the benefits of maintaining the status 
quo. Encourage a mindset that values proactive risk 
management over short\-term gains.

Proactive Dependency 
Management:

• High fix rates and low time to remediate metrics are key 
indicators of a component’s reliability. Also, components 
with transparent supply chain practices, like publishing 
an SBOM, typically exhibit lower Persistent Risk.

• Regularly audit your open source dependencies to iden\-
tify vulnerabilities, particularly those that span multiple 
versions. Implement automated tools to track and reme\-
diate these issues before they impact your software.

Adopt a Comprehensive Quality 
Assessment Framework:

• When selecting open source projects, go beyond 

surface\-level metrics like the number of stars or forks. 
While popular projects often fix vulnerabilities more 
quickly, they are not inherently risk\-free. Ensure your 
selection process incorporates more risk\-related indi\-
cators, such as Persistent Risk across versions.

With the right tools, processes, and 
best practices, managing these 
risks and ensuring the security and 
reliability of software supply chains 
becomes possible and efficient. 

• Develop a systematic approach for updating depen\-
dencies as soon as fixes become available. This will 
minimize Persistent Risk and prevent software from 
“aging like steel.”

Mitigate Complacency 
in Maintenance:

• Implement policies that enforce regular reviews and 

updates of all open source dependencies, particularly 
those neglected for over a year. This approach will com\-
bat latent risks and reduce the chances of introducing 
vulnerabilities into your software.

• Utilize tooling that provides real\-time alerts for out\-

dated or vulnerable dependencies, akin to a smoke 
detector for your software supply chain. However, it 
must only alert when action is truly required. These 
tools should prompt timely updates and prevent 
complacency.

10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINEXECUTIVE SUMMARY10TH ANNUAL STATE OF THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINBEST PRACTICESStay Vigilant Against Malicious 
Open Source Software:

• Be particularly cautious when integrating new or 

lesser\-known components into your software. The 
rise of malicious packages targeting innovative or less 
frequently used projects necessitates heightened 
awareness and rigorous validation.

• Avoid dependency management approaches that 
always update components to the latest version. 
Instead, upgrades should be considered based on an 
optimal version and the optimal version zone, both 
strategies we addressed in last year’s report.

Collaboration and 
Continuous Improvement:

• Participate in or align with initiatives like the Open 

Source Consumption Manifesto and collaborate with 
industry groups to stay informed about emerging risks 
and best practices.

• Review and refine your open source consumption 

policies regularly based on the latest industry research 
and metrics, ensuring your organization stays ahead of 
new threats and challenges. 

Work in the 
Upstream:

• Participating in open source projects helps you stay 
informed about bugs and vulnerabilities, align your 
roadmaps with open source projects, and ensure 
your interests are represented. Projects often appre\-
ciate the extra set of hands as it helps with their 
sustainability.

• Active software supply chain management involves 

helping maintain the open source projects you depend 
on. Don’t leave it to others, and avoid making yourself 
dependent on often unknown entities.

Cybersecurity is a Universal Issue

In 2024, the policies shaping this movement have 
come into sharper focus and, in some cases, are 
already being implemented and enforced. While each 
country is dealing with its own set of regulations, 
cybersecurity is a unifying issue. As such, regulations 
are integral to improving the cybersecurity posture of 
organizations across the globe. As a global leader in 
protecting the software supply chain, we feel that regu\-
lations will be foundational to how the industry mounts 
effective countermeasures against the always\-evolving 
cybersecurity threat landscape. Liability has shifted 
from just the developers to the consumers of tech\-
nology, with potentially harsh financial penalties for 
noncompliance.

SECURITY ISN’T JUST A DEVELOPMENT ISSUE; 

IT’S A BOARDROOM ISSUE.

Securing the software supply chain has become 
one of the guiding principles for this raft of legisla\-
tion. As we’ve covered in this report, modern soft\-
ware development relies heavily on open source 
components, and protecting components is critical 
to compliance with these new standards.

Before the industry can apply rules, regulations, 
and best practices effectively, organizations 
need to be able to understand what is being 
demanded: 
☑ Understanding how new policies 
 interact with existing measures
☑ Knowing what organizations 
 are impacted
☑ Who’s responsible for what

When the White House issued Executive Order 14028 
on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, it was the first 
federal regulation targeting the security of software 
components. It was also the impetus for a wave of activ\-
ity \- both legislatively and industry\-driven \- designed to 
drive immediate improvements in the nation’s IT security 
posture. The order included a directive for the National 
Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) to issue 
guidance on enhancing the security of the software 
supply chain, which it did with an update to The Secure 
Software Development Framework (SSDF) Version 1\.1, or 
NIST SP 800\-218\. 

EO 14028 also requires that system integrators and soft\-
ware vendors comply with the Secure Software Devel\-
opment Attestation Form provided by the Cybersecurity 
and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), which requires vendors 
supplying software to federal entities to certify through a 
CEO or an authorized designee’s signature that their soft\-

NIS2 is the European Union’s most comprehensive 
cybersecurity legislation and focuses on critical infra\-
structure and essential services. Taking effect on October 
17th, 2024, NIS2 replaces the NIS Directive from 2016 
and modernizes the legal framework to keep pace with 
increased digitization and evolving cybersecurity threats. 

Bolstering security for software supply chains is central 
to NIS2, and like most EU\-wide legislation, NIS2 provides 
a minimum framework that member states must adhere 
to but allows for flexibility in how it’s implemented at the 
national level. In particular, it sets for minimum cybersecu\-
rity risk management measures and reporting obligations 
in Article 21, Section 2 of NIS2\. These include:

a. policies on risk analysis and information system 

security;

b. incident handling;
c. business continuity, such as backup management 
and disaster recovery, and crisis management;
d. supply chain security, including security\-related 

aspects concerning the relationships between each 
entity and its direct suppliers or service providers;
e. security in network and information systems acqui\-
sition, development and maintenance, including 
vulnerability handling and disclosure;

f. policies and procedures to assess the effectiveness 

of cybersecurity risk\-management measures;

training;

h. policies and procedures regarding the use of cryp\-

tography and, where appropriate, encryption;
i. human resources security, access control policies 

and asset management;

j. the use of multi\-factor authentication or continu\-

ous authentication solutions, secured voice, video 
and text communications and secured emergency 
communication systems within the entity, where 
appropriate

NIS2 also places an emphasis on reporting and requires 
organizations to submit an early warning of significant 
cybersecurity incidents within 24 hours. These need 
to be submitted to the relevant CSIRT and indicate if 
the significant incident is suspected of being caused 
by unlawful or malicious acts. Within 72 hours, the first 
report must be updated to include an initial assessment 
of the incident, including severity and impact. Within a 
month, a final report is required that includes a detailed 
description of the incident, including its severity and 
impact, the type of threat or root cause that is likely to 
have triggered the incident, and ongoing mitigation 
measures being taken.

DORA is expected to go into effect in January 2025 and 
applies to every bank, investment service, and insurance 
company doing business within the European Union – 
more than 20,000 companies and third\-party service 
providers. Like other regulations, it’s also chiefly con\-
cerned with the integrity of open source components and 
considers software composition analysis (SCA) as a basic 
security requirement that all institutions under its guid\-
ance must apply. To this end, DORA includes language 
outlining how to achieve a high level of digital opera\-
tional resilience and emphasizes open source analysis 
as a fundamental security requirement:

To reflect differences that exist across, and within, 
the various financial subsectors as regards financial 
entities’ level of cybersecurity preparedness, testing 
should include a wide variety of tools and actions, 
ranging from the assessment of basic requirements 
(e.g. vulnerability assessments and scans, open 
source analyses, network security assessments, gap 
analyses, physical security reviews, questionnaires 
and scanning software solutions, source code reviews 
where feasible, scenario\-based tests, compatibility 
testing, performance testing or end\-to\-end testing) to 
more advanced testing by means of TLPT.

The European Parliament approved the CRA in March 
of 2024 and most of its provisions become enforceable 
starting in 2027\. This sweeping legislation, which estab\-
lishes essential requirements for manufacturers to ensure 
their products reach the market with fewer vulnerabili\-
ties, applies to any software or hardware product and its 
remote data processing solutions, as well as products with 
digital elements whose intended use includes a logical or 
physical data connection to a device or network. 

Specifically, the CRA sets a standard for digital resiliency 
in the EU through a focus on the security of the software 
supply chain by placing key requirements for the secu\-
rity of software components, vulnerability handling, and 
reporting requirements on suppliers. 

Again, the CRA has been developed with an eye toward 
protecting open source software. Incorporating robust 
security measures into the development process is nec\-
essary to strengthen your approach to OSS components 
and SDLC processes that take into account established 
best practices that will minimize risks. As a result of the 
CRA, all software components will be required to obtain 
the CE certification mark. 

Organizations will be held accountable if any software or 
hardware product that contains digital elements is found 
to be non\-compliant. If products are discovered to be 
non\-compliant, sanctions will apply, including fines of up to 
€15 million or 2\.5% of a company’s global annual turnover, 
whichever is higher.

Key SBOM mandates of the CSCRF include:

This summer, the Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(SEBI) introduced the Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience 
Framework (CSCRF) to help enhance cybersecurity for 
regulated entities (REs). Critical to the CSCRF is mandat\-
ing strict guidelines for software bill of materials (SBOMs) 
in order to improve transparency, track vulnerabilities, 
and mitigate supply chain risks.

• New software: REs must obtain SBOMs for any new 
software products or Software\-as\-a\-Service (SaaS) 
applications related to core and critical activities during 
procurement.

• Existing software: SBOMs must be obtained for existing 
critical systems within six months of CSCRF issuance.

SEBI characterizes the importance of SBOM 
management and its benefits in the CSCRF with 
the following:

Recent security breaches at third\-party vendors like 
Apache (Log4j), SolarWinds, etc. have led to the 
introduction of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) 
that enables an organization to identify possible vul\-
nerabilities in the applications/ software solutions.

• Ongoing updates: SBOMs must be updated with each 

software upgrade or modification.

• Legacy systems: Where SBOMs are unavailable for 

proprietary or legacy systems, RE boards must provide 
approval, detailing the rationale and risk management 
approach. 

FIND OUT MORE ABOUT 
INDIA’S CSCRE

BENEFITS FOR REGUL ATED ENTITIES IN INDIA WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF SBOMS:

☑ Transparency 
REs will become more aware of components, 
versions, licenses, cryptographic hashes, etc., that they 
are using in their software applications. 
☑ Tracking vulnerabilities
REs will be able to track the vulnerability status for each 
of the components as and when an update is made or a 
component is added/ deleted.

☑ Mitigate risks
REs will be able to prevent and mitigate supply chain 
risks arising due to open\-source or third\-party depen\-
dencies in software components.
☑ Audit
REs will have the confidence that only authorized third\-
party dependencies have been used in their software 
applications and that they can be audited as and when 
required.

The Essential Eight strategies are guidelines intro\-
duced by the Australian Signals Directorate’s Strategies 
to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents. The Essential Eight 
mitigation strategies include:

T H E AU ST R A L I A E S S E N T I A L E I G H T 

M I T I GAT I O N ST R AT EG I E S I N C LU D E :

☑ Application Control
☑ Patch Applications
☑ Configure Microsoft Office Macro Settings
☑ User Application Hardening
☑ Restrict Administrative Privileges
☑ Patch Operating Systems
☑ Multi\-factor Authentication
☑ Regular Backups

These strategies provide a framework for organizations 
to evaluate current practices and increase their resiliency 
against cyber threats. The Essential Eight is organized 
around four maturity levels by which organizations can 
evaluate and boost their cybersecurity measures. 

M AT U R I T Y L E V E L Z E R O
This maturity level signifies that there are weaknesses 
in an organization’s overall cybersecurity posture. When 
exploited, these weaknesses could facilitate the compro\-
mise of the confidentiality of their data or the integrity or 
availability of their systems and data, as described by the 
tradecraft and targeting in Maturity Level One below.

M AT U R I T Y L E V E L O N E
The focus of this maturity level is malicious actors who 
are content to simply leverage commodity tradecraft that 
is widely available in order to gain access to, and likely 
control of, a system. 

M AT U R I T Y L E V E L T W O
This maturity level focuses on malicious actors operating 
with a modest step\-up in capability from the previous 
maturity level. These malicious actors are willing to invest 
more time in a target and, perhaps more importantly, in 
the effectiveness of their tools. 

M AT U R I T Y L E V E L T H R E E
The focus of this maturity level is malicious actors who 
are more adaptive and much less reliant on public tools 
and techniques. These malicious actors are able to 
exploit the opportunities provided by weaknesses in their 
target’s cybersecurity posture, such as the existence of 
older software or inadequate logging and monitoring. 
Malicious actors do this not only to extend their access 
once initial access has been gained to a target but also 
to evade detection and solidify their presence. Malicious 
actors make swift use of exploits when they become pub\-
licly available, as well as other tradecraft that can improve 
their chance of success.

Another Australian measure to boost cybersecurity is the 
March 2024 update to the Australian Signals Director\-
ate’s Information Security Manual (ISM). The ISM provides 
a framework based on risk management principles and 
best practices to help CISOs, CIOs, cybersecurity profes\-
sionals, and IT managers protect their systems and data 
from malicious actors.

The ISM includes cybersecurity guidelines designed 
to ‘provide practical guidance on how an organization 
can protect its systems and data from cyber threats.’ 

These include Guidelines for Software Development, 
which provide a useful set of guidelines for creating tra\-
ditional and mobile applications to increase security. The 
ISM is a framework, so organizations are not yet required 
by law to comply. However, it’s a useful tool for compa\-
nies to ensure they do not violate existing legislation, 
and under its guidance, organizations can put up a pretty 
effective defense against data breaches.

Since our inception, Sonatype has led with the precision 
and accuracy of our open source intelligence. From the 
start, our core principle has been to avoid wasting engi\-
neers’ time with false positives and negatives. As open 
source usage and security research exploded, the num\-
ber of true risk findings has increased dramatically. This 
has created a significant burden on development produc\-
tivity, forcing organizations to choose between ignoring 
material risks and impairing productivity.

The only possible path forward as we see it is to use a reli\-
able dependency management automation platform that 
scales as needed and only updates component versions 
when necessary. This automation cuts down the noise, 
reduces Persistent Risks, improves open source compo\-
nent quality and creates a better malware defense while 
saving valuable engineering time with full transparency. 

Implementing reliable automation for open source 
dependency management can have a 
transformative shift in your organization:

• Reduced conflict and seamless collaboration between 

security and engineering teams

• Improved productivity by freeing up 5% of engineering 

capacity

• Enhanced security due to a significant drop in open 

source risk levels

• Quality and reliability improvements by integrating 

high\-quality open source components

• Better competitive advantage through improved 

security and increased productivity
