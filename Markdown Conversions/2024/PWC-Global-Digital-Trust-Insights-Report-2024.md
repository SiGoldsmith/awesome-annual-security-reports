The C\-suite playbook: 
Putting security 
at the epicenter 
of innovation

Findings from the 2024 Global 
Digital Trust Insights

PwC \| 2024 Global Digital Trust InsightsSecurity at the epicenter of innovation: That’s not 
the world we live in today, but what if it were?

While excitement and budgets are rising for cutting\-edge 
security programmes, progress on actually improving 
security is sluggish, even stagnant. 

PwC’s 2024 Global Digital Trust Insights survey of 3,876 
business and tech executives at the largest global 
companies — 30% of respondents have revenues of 
$10 billion or more — shows considerable room for 
improvement in cybersecurity. 

Consider these findings. Breach costs and the number 
of high\-dollar breaches continue to increase. Although 
cloud attacks are the top cyber concern, about one\-
third of organisations have no risk management plan to 
address cloud service provider challenges. Only half are 
‘very satisfied’ with their technology capabilities in key 
cybersecurity areas. More than 30% of companies don’t 
consistently follow what should be standard practices of 
cyber defence. 

Imagine a world with security at the epicenter 
of innovation — the field where bright ideas and 
bold ambitions flourish. Imagine the CISO right 
there, working to secure the organisation’s lofty 
ambitions and prized assets.

We note 179 respondents who seem to be doing just that. 
These top 5% — our stewards of digital trust — are reaping 
benefits that others are missing. They’re experiencing fewer 
breaches, and the attacks that do hit them aren’t as costly. 
Managing risk is easier because they’ve streamlined their 
security solutions. And they’ve positioned themselves 
for greater productivity and faster growth, outpacing the 
competition as they plunge into new technologies with 
confidence that they are well protected.

it is tantamount to protecting the enterprise. That’s why in 
2023, PwC created a playbook for C\-level executives to help 
each C\-level executive focus on the questions they need to 
answer with their CISO. 

We’ve updated the playbook for 2024\. This is likely to be 
a watershed year. Cybersecurity faces four major shifts, 
each of which could be disruptive on its own.

• C\-suite insistence on modernising and improving 

technology infrastructure and investments in a year of 
cost\-cutting and macroeconomic uncertainty.

• A groundbreaking new technology — generative AI — 

bringing new threats as well as unprecedented promise 
for defence.

• Regulations requiring openness about cyber incidents 

and risk management practices that could usher in a new 
era of transparency and collaboration.

Businesses are reinventing themselves. Policymakers are 
thinking of new regulatory approaches. Are your senior 
executives being similarly innovative in the way they secure 
their organisations? How bold can you be, and what might 
you do differently?

• 

The rise of hybrid cyber threats and the blurring of the 
line between espionage and cybercrime, propelling cyber 
defence more fully into the national security arena.

Innovation means making bold moves, and there’s 
nothing more empowering than knowing that you’ve 
done what’s possible to remain safe and secure — that 
you’ve assessed and addressed your most important 
cyber risks.

Mitigating cyber risk is a top priority for 2024, according 
to PwC’s 2024 Global Digital Trust Insights survey. After 
dropping to fourth place in last year’s PwC CEO Survey, it’s 
now second for our respondents, behind only digital and 

technology risks on the list of prioritized risks. And in the 
minds of our respondents, digital and technology risks are 
inextricable from cyber risk.

In today’s business climate, we simply can’t talk about 
digital transformation or reinvention without mentioning 
cybersecurity in the same breath. Cloud attacks and attacks 
on connected devices are the cyber threats our respondents 
are most concerned about — two technologies at the heart of 
business transformation today. 

Digital tops the risk list in two ways

Digital and technology risks (adverse consequence from new or frontier 
technologies, inability to execute digital transformation initiatives, digital)

PwC \| 2024 Global Digital Trust InsightsThese cyber threats themselves are connected. Once 
malicious actors break into systems and networks, they often 
wreak havoc in as many ways as possible.

Everything is connected, including 
cyber attacks

What may start as a cloud breach could very well become 
an advanced persistent threat as bad actors lurk inside your 
system collecting data and looking for other ways to do harm. 
They might exfiltrate your data, then launch a ransomware 
attack, then leak the data (“hack and leak”) even if you pay the 
ransom.

Any one of these incidents would be problematic on its 
own. Taken all together, they can devastate your business 
operations and your reputation. Mega breaches are increasing 
in number and scale — and cost. The percentage of those 
reporting costs of $1 million or more for their worst breach in 
the past three years rose to 36% from 27% last year. 

The pace of business reinvention and innovation using 
technology is not slowing down. Not when 40% of CEOs 
think their companies may no longer be economically viable 
a decade from now if they stay on their current path. The 
C\-suite challenge is this: Is your organisation’s cyber risk 
management keeping up with the changes?

Simplification of cyber tools: The bane of bad actors

Modernisation and optimisation top the cyber\-investment 
priorities for 2024\. Nearly half (49%) of the business leaders 
selected technology modernisation, including cyber 
infrastructure, and 45% chose optimisation of existing 
technologies and investments. 

In our 2022 survey we found that CEOs in particular were 
very concerned that their organisations had become too 
complex to secure. At that time, 32% had consolidated 
technology vendors in an effort to simplify, as well as realign 
their mix of managed and in\-house services. 

In the 2024 survey, 44% report using an integrated suite of 
cyber tech solutions, and 39% plan to move to one in the 
next two years. Nearly one\-fifth — 19% — say they have too 
many cyber solutions and need to consolidate. 

An overabundance of point solutions may be one reason 
why only 5% of IT and tech respondents say they’re ‘very 
satisfied’ with the technology capabilities of their cyber 
solutions in all eight key areas. Software that doesn’t work 
together can hinder performance, require more time to 
manage and impede the big\-picture view that’s essential to 
managing cyber risk. 

Those who’ve already been hit know this. Our 
survey respondents who have had data breaches 
costing $1 million or more in the past three years 
are more likely to acknowledge that they have too 
many cybersecurity solutions and need to integrate 
them. On the other hand, organisations that use 
cohesive cyber\-solution suites are more often able 
to avoid the big, costly breaches.

Cloud security: Overdue for concerted attention

Cloud use has always been about business innovation 
— enabling developers to collaborate no matter where 
in the world they might be; adopting new, more flexible 
ways to work; inventing new business models; connecting 
technologies to help better operate the business; providing 
superior service to customers and clients; and so on. 

Cloud security is the No. 1 cyber risk concern for nearly 
half (47%) of our respondents. The ways bad actors might 
get in may seem virtually limitless. Organisations should 
place controls everywhere: on identity and access, lateral 
movement, email accounts, website portals, applications, 
proprietary information, customer interactions, operating 
systems, connected devices, the list goes on.

cloud, and concerns over cloud security increase among 
users of multiple — hybrid — clouds. Fifty\-four percent 
of these respondents cite cloud as their most pressing 
cybersecurity risk. Hybrid cloud users are also the most likely 
to select cloud among their top three priorities for security 
investments over the next year (36% as opposed 
to 33% overall).

But nearly every organisation — 97% — has gaps in its 
cloud risk management plan. Only 3% maintain up\-to\-
date plans that address all nine cloud security areas. Risks 
posed by fragmented regulations, for instance, have yet to 
be addressed by 42%; 41% have no plan for dealing with

PwC \| 2024 Global Digital Trust InsightsGenerative AI for cyber defence on the rise

Nearly seven in 10 say their organisation will use generative 
AI (GenAI) for cyber defence. GenAI tools can help reduce 
a disadvantage for cyber teams overwhelmed by the sheer 
number and complexity of human\-led cyber attacks, both of 
which continually increase.

GenAI for cyber defence

More than two\-thirds (69%) 
say they’ll use GenAl for 
cyber defence in the next
12 months.

Nearly half (47%) are already 
using it for cyber risk 
detection and mitigation.

seeing beneﬁts to their 
cyber programmes because 
of GenAl – mere months

in tandem with their cyber tech solutions. Microsoft Security 
Copilot intends to provide GenAI features for security posture 
management, incident response and security reporting. 
Google announced Security AI Workbench for similar use 
cases.

Many vendors are pushing the limits of GenAI, testing what’s 
possible. It could be some time before we see broad\-scale 
use of defenceGPTs. In the meantime, here are the three 
most promising areas for using GenAI in cyber defence. 

• Threat detection and analysis. GenAI can be 

invaluable for proactively detecting vulnerability exploits, 
rapidly assessing their extent — what’s at risk, what’s 
already compromised and what the damages are, and 
then presenting tried\-and\-true options for defence and 
remediation. GenAI can help identify patterns, anomalies 
and indicators of compromise that elude traditional 
signature\-based detection systems. 

• Cyber risk and incident reporting. GenAI might also 
make cyber risk and incident reporting much simpler. 
With the help of natural language processing (NLP), 
GenAI can turn technical data into concise content that 
nontechnical people can understand. It can help with 
incident response reporting, threat intelligence, risk 
assessments, audits and regulatory compliance. And it 
can present its recommendations in terms that anyone 
can understand, even translating confounding graphs 
into simple text.

• Adaptive controls. Securing the cloud and software 
supply chain requires constant updates in security 
policies and controls — a daunting task today. Machine 
learning algorithms and GenAI tools could soon 
recommend, validate and draft security policies and 
automate controls that are tailored to an organisation’s 
threat profile, technologies and business objectives.

The C\-suite challenge is this: How do you wield 
the new tools without inviting new risks to flare up in 
the organisation and in society? What should you do 
to use GenAI ethically and responsibly?

PwC \| 2024 Global Digital Trust InsightsRegulations: Providing a safe place to play and grow

The mainstream view is that new rules and regulations 
hinder revenues, but here’s the take of at least one\-third 
of respondents: The guardrails regulators put up can give 
companies added confidence to explore, experiment, invent 
and compete. Navigating regulatory requirements can 
become a competitive advantage for leading companies.

About a third of this year’s respondents agree that four 
types of regulation will be most important to securing the 
future growth of their organisation — regulation of AI (37%), 
harmonisation of cyber and data protection laws (36%), 

mandatory reporting of cyber risk management, strategy and 
governance (35%) and operational resilience requirements 
(32%).

Transparency is the regulatory drumbeat that will grow louder 
around the world. New SEC rules require public disclosure of 
cybersecurity breaches deemed to have a potential material 
effect on investors. The Digital Markets Act and the Digital 
Services Act require transparency in data practices and 
algorithmic decision\-making. And regulations are on the 
horizon governing AI — including an EU AI Act in the works 
and GenAI regulation.

Operational resilience is another important theme. Regulators 
know that it’s a big risk to approach the challenge of 
interrelated and complex risks as many C\-suite teams still 
habitually do — as a silo\-based exercise that treats each 
business unit’s risk profile as separate. New requirements 
such as the Digital Operational Resilience Act will 
increasingly insist on integrated resilience with core elements 
that make an organisation adaptive, flexible and stronger 
after every disruptive event.

As many as three\-quarters expect that compliance with these 
regulations will require significant outlays of money and time. 
Incurring high costs and revenue impacts may be avoidable, 

if businesses involve themselves early and often in regulatory 
processes — meeting with law enforcement, for example, 
participating in public comments and even taking a seat at 
the table with regulators to help craft or influence proposed 
directives. 

The C\-suite challenge is this: Amid regulatory 
uncertainty, can you give your organisation the 
room to innovate while keeping security and privacy 
by design? How do you turn this new regulatory 
environment as a source of competitive advantage?

C\-suite playbook

It’s no longer business\-as\-usual at your organisation. 
But most companies are still locked into cyber\-as\-
usual, as the 2024 Global Digital Trust Insights survey 
shows. Fragmented initiatives. An ever\-expanding array of 
technological complexities. A risk management programme 
that, with its gaps, is risky in itself. Transformations 

and projects that don’t produce the results you want. 
These stumbling blocks and others remain in the way of 
cybersecurity that’s truly trustworthy.

In the 2023 playbook, we identified critical challenges that 
C\-suite executives should address together, as partners. 
These are still relevant.

the challenge:

Do you dare, as a C\-suite leader, to 
break out of the stasis and make the 
one or two bold moves that will matter 
most for your organisation? 

Or to take that one imaginative leap 
that could finally clear the hurdles 
blocking your company from its goals? 

We see some enterprises already 
picking their best bets. The array of 
options is broad.

What’s right for your organisation?

PwC \| 2024 Global Digital Trust InsightsSpeak a new language.

CISO

CFO

Placing yourself at the epicenter of innovation means meeting 
your leadership teams where they are and helping them to 
overcome the intimidation they might feel regarding what 
you do. Using insider terms such as cyber landscape, attack 
surface and even zero trust can only further mystify those 
outside your profession. 

Dare to talk about cyber in business\-speak, tech\-speak, 
finance\-speak or everyday\-speak. Speak to your customers, 
investors and business partners in annual security reports in 
ways that inform and engage. Using common vocabularies 
can help executives wrestle with the trade\-offs, tensions and 
chaos that inevitably happen at the epicenter of innovation.

Try bold, new ways of managing cyber risk.

CISO

COO

Use more sophisticated approaches to cyber\-risk modeling 
such as scanning for threats using formulas specific to your 
company’s sector, vision and strategy. Create a risk\-linked 
performance incentive for every bonus\-eligible employee in 
the company, to build a risk culture. Invent new ways to find 

and strengthen your weaknesses, perhaps with a modern 
bug bounty programme that incentivises independent 
security research. Finally procure and begin using a cloud\-
first, centrally managed identity solution to secure your 
business expansion goals. 

Shape guardrails.

Speak the language of trust, not just regulatory compliance. 
Involve yourself early and often for the better chance at 
influencing any new rules and ensuring that they boost, not 
hinder, business success. AI, the metaverse, cryptocurrency, 
privacy — these hot regulatory topics could well benefit from 
your experience and insights. Remember, regulators can feel 
as befuddled as anyone by the workings of cyber and tech.

GenAI, managed services).

CISO

CIO

CTO

CRO

COO

Providing you with around\-the\-clock eyes is one benefit 
of automation, GenAI and managed services. Performing 
mundane chores so your teams don’t have to is another. 

Liberated from the tyranny of tedious tasks, your people may 
find time and space to ponder new cyber threats and create 
new ways to thwart evolving threats.

Welcome cyber into the boardroom.

CISO

B

CEO

Cyber tops the risk register in most companies and on many 
executive surveys. But is it a staple topic in your boardroom? 
Are you getting quality information not on cyber risks and 
controls, but also on how major strategic initiatives are 
furthering business and revenue growth? Security provides 

the underpinnings for everything the organisation does: 
finance, development, personnel, technology and other areas 
of the business you likely discuss every time you meet.

Looking your cyber programme squarely in the eye can be a 
daring move.

Think like the business owner.

CISO

CEO

Business transformation is one thing. Cyber transformation is 
not another. They are the same. The CISO and CEO together 
need now embrace cyber as a whole\-of\-business endeavor, 
putting yourselves in the business owner’s shoes. Wouldn’t 
they want every aspect — financial records, proprietary 

research, application development, customer data and the 
like — protected from unauthorized viewing or use? Wouldn’t 
they want to safeguard their brand? Couldn’t cybersecurity 
spur innovations that save money and help the business to 
grow? This is the raison d’etre of cyber.

PwC \| 2024 Global Digital Trust InsightsAbout the survey 

The 2024 Global Digital Trust Insights is a survey of 3,876 
business, technology and security executives (CEOs, 
corporate directors, CFOs, CISOs, CIOs and C\-Suite officers) 
conducted in the May through July 2023 period.

Respondents are based in 71 countries. The regional 
breakdown is Western Europe (32%), North America (28%), 
Asia Pacific (18%), Latin America (10%), Eastern Europe (5%), 
Africa (4%) and Middle East (3%).

Four out of 10 executives are in large companies with 
$5 billion or more in revenues. Importantly, 30% are in 
companies with $10 billion or more in revenues.

Respondents operate in a range of industries, including 
industrial manufacturing (20%), financial services (20%), 
tech, media, telecom (19%), retail and consumer markets 
(17%), energy, utilities, and resources (11%), health (9%) 
and government and public services (3%).

The Global Digital Trust Insights Survey had been known 
as the Global State of Information Security Survey (GSISS). 
In its 26th year, it’s the longest\-running annual survey 
on cybersecurity trends. It’s also the largest survey in 
the cybersecurity industry and the only one that draws 
participation from senior business executives, not just 
security and technology executives.

PwC Research, PwC’s global Centre of Excellence for market 
research and insight, conducted this survey.
