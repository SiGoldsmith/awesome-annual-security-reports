Malicious cyberattacks that originate from a 
particular country and are an attempt to further 
that country’s interests. These attacks are 
often fueled by geopolitical competition and a 
desire to gain an advantage over other nations. 
Common objectives include stealing intellectual 
property for economic benefit or supporting 
traditional espionage. 

▪ Cybercriminal activity: Cybercriminals are 

Key information 

typically motivated by financial gain. They may 
use similar tools and tactics as nation\-state threat 
actors, such as bespoke malware, password spray 
infrastructure, and phishing or social engineering 
campaigns. However, their primary goal is to 
profit from their activities, rather than to further a 
nation’s geopolitical objectives. 

▪ Cyber operations: An overarching term referring 

to all computer network operations, from 
computer network defense to computer network 
attacks, and to computer network exploitation.

Introduction 

Our unique vantage point Cybersecurity at Microsoft 

Complex, challenging, and increasingly dangerous 
The new cyber threat landscape: an introduction by Tom Burt 

“We all can, and must, do better, 
hardening our digital domains to 
protect our networks, data, and 
people at all levels.” 

In the last year, the cyber threat landscape continued 
to become more dangerous and complex. 

The malign actors of the world are becoming 
better resourced and better prepared, with 
increasingly sophisticated tactics, techniques, 
and tools that challenge even the world’s best 
cybersecurity defenders. 

’

Because these actors conduct both targeted and 
opportunistic attacks, the threat they present is 
universal, meaning organizations, users, and devices 
are at risk anywhere, anytime. Even Microsoft has 
\-
been the victim of well\-orchestrated attacks by 
determined and well\-resourced adversaries, and our 
customers face more than 600 million cybercriminal 
and nation\-state attacks every day, ranging from 
ransomware to phishing to identity attacks.

\-

’

These cyberattacks are continuing at a breathtaking 
scale, and as they increasingly put human health 
at risk, the stakes for stopping them couldn’t 
be higher. In the US alone this fiscal year, 389 
healthcare institutions were successfully hit by 
ransomware, resulting in network closures, systems 
offline, critical medical operations delayed, and 
appointments rescheduled. Worse, the increased 
risk of cyberattacks is no longer limited to civilian 
cybercriminals. Nation\-states are becoming more 
aggressive in the cyber domain, with ever\-growing 
levels of technical sophistication that reflect 
increased investment in resources and training. 
These state\-sponsored hackers are not just stealing 
data, but launching ransomware, prepositioning 
backdoors for future destruction, sabotaging 
operations, and conducting influence campaigns.

\-

We have to find a way to stem the tide of this 
malicious cyber activity. We all can, and must, do 
better, hardening our digital domains to protect 
our networks, data, and people at all levels. 
This challenge will not be accomplished solely by 
executing a well\-known checklist of cyber hygiene 
measures but through a focus on and commitment 
to the foundations of cyber defense from the 
individual user level to the executive level. 

\-

However, improved defense will not be enough. 
The sheer volume of attacks must be reduced 
through effective deterrence, and while the industry 
must do more to deny the efforts of attackers via 
better cybersecurity, this needs to be paired with 
government action to impose consequences that 
further discourage the most harmful cyberattacks.

Introduction by Tom Burt continued 

About this report 

Introduction Our unique vantage point Cybersecurity at Microsoft 

While in recent years a great deal of attention has 
been given to the development of international 
norms of conduct in cyberspace, those norms 
so far lack meaningful consequence for their 
violation, and nation\-state attacks have been 
undeterred, increasing in volume and aggression. 
Cybercriminals similarly continue to attack with 
impunity, knowing that law enforcement is 
hampered by the challenges of investigation and 
prosecution of cross\-border crime, and often 
operating from within apparent safe havens where 
government authorities turn a blind eye to the 
malicious activity. 

\-

While the immediate outlook is pessimistic, there 
are changes on the near horizon that provide cause 
’
for optimism. In this year’s Microsoft Digital Defense 
Report, we dive deeper into the subject of AI in 
cybersecurity. We explore the associated emerging 
threats and defense strategies, as well as examine 
the responses of governments around the world to 
this rapidly evolving technology. And although we 
must anticipate the use of AI by attackers, advances 
in AI\-powered cybersecurity should give defenders 
an asymmetric advantage in the near future. 

\-

This year we will also share how Microsoft is 
responding to the significant attacks on our 
corporate infrastructure. This includes details of our 
Secure Future Initiative and how we are orchestrating 
a company\-wide initiative to make security our top 
corporate priority. We hope that these learnings will 
help others think through their own security posture 
and approach to cyber defense. 

\-

Microsoft is proud to deliver the Microsoft 
Digital Defense Report, now in its fifth edition, 
as part of our commitment to helping the world 
understand and mitigate cyber threats. We believe 
transparency and information\-sharing are essential 
to the protection of the global cyber ecosystem. 
Communicating the insights that we derive from our 
unique vantage point is one of the many ways we 
work to make the cyber world a safer place.

\-

\-

As our CEO, Satya Nadella, has said: “This is a 
consequential time.” We stand on the frontier of 
an AI\-empowered world. It is up to us, however, 
\-
to leverage AI most effectively. In the tug\-of\-
war between attackers and defenders in which 
the attackers currently have an advantage, it 
will take conscientiousness and commitment by 
both the public and private sectors to ensure the 
defenders win.

About this report 

Introduction Our unique vantage point Cybersecurity at Microsoft 

Our unique vantage point 

The depth and breadth of Microsoft’s 
presence in the digital ecosystem offers 
a unique perspective that we share in 
this report. 

Our expansive, global vantage point gives us insight 
into key trends in cybersecurity that affect everyone 
from individuals to nations. 

We process more than 78 trillion security signals per 
day, from billions of Windows endpoints, the cloud, 
and a broad spectrum of products and services. 
From these signals we gain visibility into attack 
activity, a unique understanding of emerging attack 
techniques, and deeper insights about the overall 
threat landscape. 

This spectrum of security signals is further enhanced 
by the diversity of our customers and partners, 
including governments, enterprises large and small, 
consumers, and gamers. 

Microsoft’s commitment to supporting the cloud 
across infrastructure, platform, application, and 
multi\-cloud scenarios complements the diversity of 
a large ecosystem of partners and suppliers which 
geometrically expands the richness of the data we 
use to understand the threat landscape. 

Yet our understanding of the threat landscape is 
more than just data. It is informed by the expertise 
of our employees: 

▪ Threat intelligence and geopolitical experts, 
tracking cybercriminal and nation\-state 
threat actors. 

▪ Security researchers, software architects, and 

engineers, responding to new threats and adding 
new security features for protection. 

▪ Analysts, internal auditors, and risk specialists, 
maintaining operational compliance within 
a complex system of cybersecurity and 
privacy regulations. 

▪ 

Incident responders, who “run to the fire” in 
support of customers. 

▪ Security advisors, working with customers across 

the spectrum of cybersecurity. 

▪ 

Investigators, analysts, and legal teams who work 
globally to disrupt borderless criminal networks, 
and align public policy objectives in support of 
digital international norms on cyberpeace. 

▪ Microsoft executives, who are directly 

accountable for (and have their compensation 
tied to) the achievement of these 
security objectives. 

Finally, the impact of AI is notable throughout 
our vantage point. Security researchers and 
threat hunters are seeing AI transform the threat 
landscape. However, Microsoft’s recent investment 
in AI technologies reflects confidence in the benefits 
these tools can provide, including a perspective that 
exceeds human processing capacity. 

Microsoft is proud of its commitment to 
cybersecurity and organizational resilience. As we 
celebrate our 50th year, we have gained valuable 
insights from past challenges. We are keen to 
share best practices that include maintaining and 
enhancing the right security culture, addressing 
technical debt associated with a longstanding 
corporate history, and investing in a secure future.

Introduction Our unique vantage point Cybersecurity at Microsoft 

Cybersecurity at Microsoft: the CISO’s perspective 

This edition of the Microsoft Digital Defense Report 
comes to you at a time when the cybersecurity 
threat landscape has intensified for every 
sector around the world. Microsoft, like many 
organizations, has become a primary target, and 
most notable is the dramatic increase in repeated, 
sophisticated, and brazen attacks by cybercriminals 
and nation\-state attackers alike. 

In January 2024 I took on the role of Microsoft 
Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). 
Immediately thereafter, we discovered we were 
under a massive cyberattack by the threat actor 
we refer to as Midnight Blizzard. The subsequent 
days are some I remember vividly. Every available 
resource across the company was utilized in our 
defense against this attack—a monumental effort 
that required speed, focus, and expertise. As I 
was directing our response, my priority became 
defending Microsoft and scaling our agility to face 
future nation\-state attacks. A large portion of our 
third\-party ecosystem was involved in this defense 
as well. 

Given ever\-changing geopolitical conditions, the 
world will face many such attacks in the future, 
and Microsoft must also adjust to face these 
threats. We have taken major steps over the past 
year in fortifying assets across the company to 
better prevent and defend against such threats. 
The cornerstone of our work to protect Microsoft, 
our partners, and customers is the Secure Future 
Initiative1 (SFI), which dedicates the entire company 
to putting security above all other considerations. 

As Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s CEO, said in a 
company\-wide announcement, “Security is a team 
sport, and accelerating SFI isn’t just job number one 
for our security teams—it’s everyone’s top priority 
and our customers’ greatest need.” Everyone at 
Microsoft is committed to making our products and 
services secure by design, secure by default, and 
operationally secure. 

Among the most significant mitigations and actions 
we have taken is a significantly expanded SFI to 
improve our defense posture. We made phishing\-
resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) mandatory 
across the company, and we increased the 
robustness of Microsoft’s corporate network. 

To protect Microsoft, our partners, and customers 
from future attacks, we dramatically grew our teams 
dedicated to monitoring of and responding to 
threats. And we reassigned roughly 34,000 full\-time 
equivalent engineers to security initiatives. This is an 
important sampling of the many steps we have taken 
since the beginning of this year—with much more 
work in progress. 

Every one of us at Microsoft shares a deep 
responsibility to do our part to keep the world safe 
and secure. As part of that commitment, we are 
collaborating closely with security experts, industry 
groups, and organizations like yours that face these 
threats every day. Please read on to learn more 
about the evolving threat landscape and how we are 
committed to making the world safer for everyone. 

Igor Tsyganskiy 
Chief Information Security Officer 

To increase the agility of Microsoft’s response to 
this ever\-changing threat environment, I instituted 
an Office of the CISO and have hired a number 
of Deputy CISOs. Our Deputy CISOs work with 
our major product groups and programs to drive 
greater depth and rigor in cybersecurity governance 
across the entire company and to direct SFI at the 
most pressing security risks. The Deputy CISOs take 
responsibility for risk ownership and accountability, 
determining the needed security architecture, 
and providing input to me on each business unit’s 
progress toward our SFI goals. Based on the ongoing 
SFI work—and with input from the Deputy CISOs 
—I provide regular updates on existing risk and SFI 
performance to Microsoft’s Senior Leadership Team 
and Board of Directors.

Key developments 
The evolving cyber 
threat landscape 

As with any landscape, things change over 
time. In the world of cybersecurity, however, 
the pace of change has been astounding. 

Observations over the past year have 
reaffirmed the convergence of nation\-state 
\-
and cybercriminal threat activity. Nation\-
state threat actors used cybercrime as a 
force multiplier, while financially motivated 
cybercriminals pursued levels of defense 
evasion and technical complexity once elusive 
outside of nation\-state operations. 

We have also seen rapid shifts in the tactics 
\-
of hybrid war, wide\-ranging attempts to 
interfere in democratic elections, and a surge 
in ransomware attacks and cyber\-enabled 
financial fraud across the globe.

\-

These trends underscore the ongoing 
necessity to enhance and implement robust 
deterrence and mitigation strategies to 
counter these threats effectively. 

The need to impose deterrent 
consequences for cyber 
aggression 

The pace of nation\-state sponsored 
cyberattacks has escalated 
to the point that there is now 
effectively constant combat in 
cyberspace without any meaningful 
consequences to the attacker.

Introduction: The evolving landscape of cybersecurity 

“As we look to the future, 
the dawning of the age 
of AI means cybersecurity 
professionals will encounter 
both new opportunities and 
new challenges.” 

As Microsoft continues to take steps to protect 
ourselves and our customers through our Secure 
Future Initiative, we encourage all organizations 
to commit to the foundational security principles 
of secure by design, secure by default, and secure 
operations. By collectively working toward these 
fundamental security concepts, defenders can 
reduce the attack surface across the broader 
technology landscape. 

At the same time, we have seen influence operations 
change and increase globally at an unprecedented 
scale as nation\-states seek to sway public perception 
and sentiment, sow discord, and undermine trust 
in public institutions. In particular, governments 
have used geopolitical issues such as the Russia\-
Ukraine conflict and the Israel\-Hamas war to spread 
divisive and misleading messages. At a time when 
the world is grappling with an overwhelming influx 
of information delivered through both formal 
and informal channels, the issue of combatting 
misinformation is becoming increasingly vital. 

As we look to the future, the dawning of the age of 
AI means cybersecurity professionals will encounter 
both new opportunities and new challenges. 
Cybercriminal groups, nation\-state threat actors, and 
other adversaries are exploring AI technologies to 
understand whether and how to leverage them in 
the course of operations. We as defenders must also 
explore and test these AI technologies, not only to 
understand how they can be used by adversaries, 
but how we can use them to strengthen our security, 
protection, and response.

As we reflect on this past year, it is more apparent 
that the lines that once divided cybercrime, nation\-
state sponsored attacks, and influence operations 
have continued to blur. Cybercrime has continued 
to mature as a robust and elaborate ecosystem, 
with cybercriminal groups utilizing a full spectrum 
of tools and techniques, including those learned, 
borrowed, or stolen from nation\-state actors. 
While these cybercriminals are evolving their 
tooling and targeting to evade defenders, many of 
their underlying techniques and behaviors remain 
unchanged due to their continued effectiveness. 
Meanwhile, nation\-state actors remain committed to 
pursuing new levels of sophistication. This includes 
creating unique tooling, upskilling their capabilities, 
and targeting major technology providers—like 
Microsoft—and enterprise supply chains. 

Defenders can proactively combat threats from 
both cybercriminal and nation\-state actors by 
addressing them at the technique layer. This means 
implementing and enforcing policies and tooling, 
such as enhanced multifactor authentication (MFA) 
and attack surface reduction rules. At the same 
time, as the threat landscape evolves, securing 
identities, hardening endpoints, and protecting the 
cloud infrastructure has become more important 
than ever.

Threat actors and motivations 

In this report, we discuss 30 different threat actors to provide examples of activity for a better understanding of attack targets, techniques, and motivations. Microsoft categorizes these actors 
using a weather\-related naming system. For example, “Flood” refers to actors who engage in influence operations. The actors included in this year’s report demonstrated significant activity and 
effectiveness from July 2023 through June 2024\. In the chart below, we map some of the motivations tracked over the past five years, to show how these actors often have multiple motivations 
driving their operations. It’s important to note that the threat landscape is vast, and the threat actors and motivations detailed here represent only a small portion of those tracked by Microsoft.

Nation\-state actors

Nation\-state threats 

Nation\-state threat 
activity by the numbers 

This past year, nation\-state affiliated threat actors 
once again demonstrated that cyber operations— 
whether for espionage, destruction, or influence— 
play a persistent supporting role in broader 
geopolitical conflicts. In the wars in Europe and the 
Middle East, Russia and Iran centered their threat 
activity on their main adversaries in those fights, 
Ukraine, and Israel, respectively. Meanwhile, Beijing’s 
long\-term focus on controlling Taiwan drove a high 
level of targeting of Taiwan\-based enterprises from 
Chinese threat actors, who also penetrated the 
countries around the South China Sea to collect 
insights into military exercises and national policy. 
What follows is a snapshot of the activity by\-the\-
numbers. 

The United States is consistently among the 
countries most impacted by the nation\-state cyber 
threat activity that Microsoft observes, a reflection 
of the large US representation in our customer base 
and the role the United States plays in research and 
development and geopolitical events. Aside from 
the United States and the United Kingdom—which 
was the fifth most targeted nation this year—most 
of the nation\-state affiliated cyber threat activity we 
observed was concentrated in sites of active military 
conflict or heightened regional tension: Israel, 
Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, and Taiwan. 

The Education and Research sector 
became the second most targeted 
by nation\-state threat actors 

In 2024, Education and Research became the 
second most targeted sector by nation\-state 
threat actors. 

In addition to offering intelligence such as 
research and policy discussions, education and 
research institutions are often used as testing 
grounds by threat actors before they pursue 
their actual targets. 

For example, QR code phishing, a technique 
now used widely to compromise user accounts 
at scale and create an entry point for business 
email compromise (BEC) attacks discussed 
later in this chapter, became widely used in 
targeted attacks against this sector as early as 
August 2023\.

Russian actors focused their targeting against European 
and North American government agencies and think 
tanks, likely for intelligence collection related to the war 
in Ukraine. Actors like Midnight Blizzard also targeted 
the IT sector, suggesting it was in part planning supply\-
chain attacks to gain access to these companies’ client’s 
networks for follow\-on operations.

Chinese threat actors’ targeting efforts remain similar 
to the last few years in terms of geographies targeted 
and intensity of targeting per location. While numerous 
threat actors target the United States across a wide 
variety of sectors, targeting in Taiwan is largely limited to 
one threat actor, Flax Typhoon. 

Most Chinese threat activity is for intelligence collection 
purposes and was especially prevalent in ASEAN 
countries around the South China Sea. Granite Typhoon 
and Raspberry Typhoon were the most active in the 
region, while Nylon Typhoon continued to target 
government and foreign affairs entities globally.

Since adopting this new strategy, the government 
has been aggressive in bolstering its cybersecurity 
posture to protect the government, businesses, and 
civil society. Notable initiatives include:

▪ Directing the JSDF to establish a new Cyber 
Command with 20,000 personnel by 2027\. 

▪ Elevating the Cabinet’s cybersecurity center 

(NISC) into a new government agency with more 
legal and regulatory authority on cybersecurity. 

Additionally, to strengthen the security of IT systems 
and supply chain management, the government 
began operating an advanced certification system 
for cloud (ISMAP)4 in 2022 for services and other 
items to be employed in government information 
systems. ISMAP is expected to expand its scope to 
the systems of critical infrastructure operators in 
the future.

Cyber Point of View: Japan

Japan is surrounded by three nation states backing 
threat actors who conduct extensive cyberattacks: 
Russia, China, and North Korea. 

In recent years, Japanese entities from large 
organizations to small companies downstream 
in the supply chain, have experienced large\-
scale cyberattacks. Against this backdrop, its 
government revised its National Security Strategy2 
in December 2022 to identify cybersecurity as a 
national security matter for the first time. The new 
National Security Strategy also introduced Active 
Cyber Defense (ACD), a government initiative to 
preemptively counter significant cyberattack risks 
that could raise national security concerns. 

Japan’s new Defense Whitepaper outlines 
its cybersecurity measures

The 2024 edition of Japan’s Defense Whitepaper3 
outlines comprehensive new measures to enhance 
the cybersecurity of The Japan Self\-Defense Forces 
(SDF), including the development of the newly 
established Cyber Command, the migration of the 
JSDF’s IT systems to the cloud, the implementation 
of advanced security architecture, and improved 
cybersecurity for Japan’s defense industry. 
The document also stresses the importance 
of international cooperation with like\-minded 
countries and companies.

Blurring lines between 
nation\-state threat actors 
and cybercriminals 

This year, state\-affiliated threat actors increasingly 
used criminal tools and tactics—and even criminals 
themselves—to advance their interests, blurring the 
lines between nation\-state backed malign activity 
and cybercriminal activity.

Microsoft observed nation\-state threat actors 
conduct operations for financial gain, enlist 
cybercriminals to collect intelligence on the 
Ukrainian military, and make use of the same 
infostealers, command and control frameworks, and 
other tools favored by the cybercriminal community. 

North Korean threat actors have long straddled 
this blurry line, conducting financially motivated 
operations to secure funding for state coffers 
and priority initiatives. The UN estimates North 
Korean hackers have stolen over $3 billion US in 
cryptocurrency since 2017, with heists totaling 
between $600 million and $1 billion US in 2023 
alone.5 These stolen funds reportedly finance over 
half of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.6 

Since 2023, Microsoft has identified three major 
North Korean threat groups—Jade Sleet, Sapphire 
Sleet, and Citrine Sleet—that have been particularly 
active in targeting cryptocurrency organizations. 
Moreover, North Korea may also be getting into the 
ransomware game. Moonstone Sleet, a new North 
Korean actor identified in May 2024, developed 
a custom ransomware variant called FakePenny 
which it deployed at organizations in aerospace and 
defense after exfiltrating data from the impacted 
networks. This behavior suggests the actor had 
objectives for both intelligence gathering and 
monetization of its access. 

Beyond North Korea, Microsoft observed Iranian 
nation\-state threat actors seeking financial gain from 
some of their offensive cyber operations. This marks 
a change from previous behavior, whereby 
ransomware attacks that were designed to appear 
financially motivated were actually destructive 
attacks.7 For example, a cyber\-enabled influence 
operation run by an Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
Corps (IRGC) group we track as Cotton Sandstorm 
(also known as Emennet Pasargad) marketed stolen 
Israeli dating website data through two of its cyber 
personas between September 2023 and February 
2024\. The personas also offered to remove specific 
individual profiles from their data repository for 
a fee.

Meanwhile, Russian threat actors have integrated 
evermore commodity malware in their 
operations and appear to have outsourced some 
cyberespionage operations to criminal groups. 
In June 2024, Storm\-2049 (UAC\-0184\) used Xworm 
and Remcos RAT\-\-commodity malware associated 
with criminal activity\-\-to compromise at least 50 
Ukrainian military devices. There was no obvious 
cybercriminal use for this compromise, suggesting 
the group was operating in support of Russian 
government objectives.

Between June\-July 2023, Microsoft observed Federal 
Security Service (FSB)\-attributed Aqua Blizzard 
appear to “hand\-off” access to 34 compromised 
Ukrainian devices to the cybercriminal group 
Storm\-0593 (also known as Invisimole). The hand\-off 
occurred when Aqua Blizzard invoked a Powershell 
script that downloaded software from a Storm\-
0593\-controlled server. Storm\-0593 then established 
command and control infrastructure and deployed 
Cobalt Strike beacons on most of the devices for 
follow\-on activity. This beacon was configured 
with the domain dashcloudew.uk, which Microsoft 
assesses Storm\-0593 registered and used in a 
previous spear\-phishing campaign against Ukrainian 
military machines last year, suggesting a pattern 
by Storm\-0593 of supporting state intelligence 
collection objectives.

The many faces 
of hybrid war 

The ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle 
East illustrate how some countries are using both 
cyber approaches and influence campaigns to 
further their goals. These activities extend beyond 
the geographical boundaries of the conflict 
zones, demonstrating the globalized nature of 
hybrid warfare. 

How Iran is using cyber\-enabled influence 
operations to degrade Israel

Following the outbreak of the Israel\-Hamas 
war, Iran surged its cyber, influence, and cyber\-
enabled influence operations against Israel. 
From October 7, 2023, to July 2024, nearly half of 
the Iranian operations Microsoft observed targeted 
Israeli companies. 

Iranian groups also expanded their cyber\-enabled 
influence operations beyond Israel, with a focus on 
undermining international political, military, and 
economic support for Israel’s military operations. 

In November 2023, IRGC groups ran cyber\-enabled 
influence operations targeting US water controllers 
made in Israel and Bahrain in retaliation for Bahrain’s 
normalizing of ties with Israel.8

Following the outbreak of the Israel\-Hamas war, Iranian threat actors surged their targeting of Israel.
Source: Microsoft Threat Intelligence nation\-state notification data

Microsoft Threat Intelligence assesses that an IRGC 
unit known as Shahid Kaveh Group, which we track 
as Storm\-0784, was responsible for defacing a water 
controller in Pennsylvania under the guise of a cyber 
persona called “CyberAv3ngers,” leaving a message 
that Israeli\-made systems are legal targets.

Throughout the conflict, Iranian threat actors have 
used cyber personas to broadcast and amplify 
their destructive attacks against Israeli enterprises, 
trying to project power and aggrandize the impact 
of their cyber operations. Within two days of 
Hamas’ attack on Israel, Iran stood up several new 
influence operations. The influence actor Sefid Flood 
launched the online personas “Tears of War” and 
“Hamsa1948\.” 

The former impersonated Israeli activists critical 
of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s 
handling of the hostage situation while the 
latter tried to convince Arab\-Israelis to violently 
oppose Israeli authorities and protest in support 
of Gazans. Microsoft Threat Intelligence assesses 
that Storm\-0842, an Iranian Ministry of Intelligence 
and Security (MOIS) unit, launched another cyber 
persona, “KarMa,” the day after the war broke out,9 
posing as Israelis seeking to remove Netanyahu 
from office.

Iranian threat actors also began impersonating 
partners after the war started. Microsoft assesses 
Cotton Sandstorm used the name and logo of 
Hamas’s military wing, the al\-Qassam Brigades, 
to spread false messaging about the hostages 
in Gaza and send Israelis threatening messages. 
Another Telegram channel that we assess was run 
by the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security 
(MOIS), which also used the al\-Qassam Brigades 
logo and threatened Israeli military personnel 
and leaked their personal data. It remains unclear 
whether Iran acted with Hamas’s consent. 

Russia’s wide\-reaching tactics for spying 
on Ukraine’s military and its allies

Russian threat actors have focused on accessing and 
stealing intelligence from Ukrainian warfighters and 
the international partners that supply them weapons. 
The techniques employed have the potential 
to cause unintended damage by posing risk to 
computer networks globally.

Since June 2023, threat actors associated with 
Russian military intelligence (GRU) and the FSB 
have used at least two undisciplined approaches 
to gain access to Ukrainian military and military\-
adjacent devices: 

1\. USB\-delivered worms: Aqua Blizzard—a Russian 
Federal Security Service (FSB)\-affiliated actor 
that has targeted Ukraine\-based entities since 
2013— accessed 500\-750 Ukraine\-based devices 
daily through the USB\-delivery of a Windows 
ShortCut file and a heavily obfuscated Powershell 
or VBScript. The scripts establish command and 
control that facilitates theft of specified file types. 
Since wormable malware and malicious USBs 
are hard to contain and can traverse to devices 
outside the scope of Aqua Blizzard’s operations, 
there is increased risk that USBs and malware will 
make their way onto networks outside of Ukraine 
and onto partner military systems.

2\. Amadey Bot and torrents: FSB\-affiliated Secret 
Blizzard and GRU\-affiliated Seashell Blizzard gain 
access to as many devices as possible before 
pursuing devices of interest. Secret Blizzard 
has done this by commandeering third\-party 
infections, like the multipurpose Amadey bots,10 
to download a custom reconnaissance tool that 
helps operators decide whether to deploy their 
first\-stage backdoor. Seashell Blizzard offers 
malicious, pirated versions of Microsoft software 
on torrents, often promoting them on Ukrainian 
file sharing websites to gain initial footholds 
in networks. 

Midnight Blizzard threatens IT supply chain

Russian threat actors are casting wide nets to 
gain insights into Western organizations involved 
in policy, military, and humanitarian support to 
Ukraine. Midnight Blizzard attempted to gain access 
to IT firms in part for widespread, indiscriminate 
access to systems. Historically, this actor exploits 
the IT software and services supply chains to target 
downstream customers in government and other 
policy organizations in North America and Europe.11 

Microsoft has been transparent about Midnight 
Blizzard’s efforts against our networks, and we were 
not the only IT sector targets. Midnight Blizzard’s 
history of supply chain compromises and 
continued pursuit of IT organizations suggests 
widespread compromise remains a major risk to 
providers worldwide.

Operational technology (OT) systems are 
at risk in hybrid warfare

Critical infrastructure is a key target of physical 
strikes and cyberattacks in modern hybrid conflicts. 
Since late 2023, Microsoft has observed an increase 
in reports of attacks on internet\-exposed, poorly 
secured OT devices that control real\-world critical 
processes. As discussed in greater detail in previous 
editions of this report, this is particularly concerning 
given these systems often have inadequate security 
practices, including being left unpatched, using 
default passwords, or even no passwords at all.

Internet\-exposed OT equipment in water and 
wastewater systems (WWS) in the United States 
were targeted in multiple attacks from October 
2023 through June 2024 by different nation\-backed 
actors, including IRGC\-affiliated CyberAv3ngers 
(tracked at Microsoft as Storm\-0784\) and pro\-
Russian hacktivists.12 CyberAv3ngers and the pro\-
Russia Cyber Army of Russia group, conduct, claim, 
or amplify attacks likely intended to intimidate 
targeted nations into capitulating or ceasing support 
for Israel and Ukraine, respectively.

China\-based cyber actors Raspberry Typhoon, Flax 
Typhoon, and Granite Typhoon have intensively 
targeted entities associated with IT, military, and 
government interests around the South China Sea.

The activity has particularly targeted countries within 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). 
Raspberry Typhoon has been extremely active, 
successfully infiltrating military and executive entities 
in Indonesia and Malaysian maritime systems in the 
lead\-up to a rare naval exercise involving Indonesia, 
China, and the United States in June 2023\. Similarly, 
Flax Typhoon focused on entities linked to joint US\-
Philippines military exercises. Since August 2023, Flax 
Typhoon has expanded its targets to include IT and 
government organizations in the Philippines, Hong 
Kong, India, and the United States. 

Since July 2023, Granite Typhoon has compromised 
telecommunication networks in Indonesia, Malaysia, 
the Philippines, Cambodia, and Taiwan. This group’s 
activities highlight a sustained pattern of strategic 
cyber engagements by Chinese state\-affiliated actors 
aimed at gathering intelligence and potentially 
disrupting military activities in strategically important 
areas like the South China Sea.

Deterring the most 
advanced threats 

As highlighted throughout this report, cyberattacks 
are on the rise and the pace of nation\-state 
sponsored attacks has escalated to the point there is 
now effectively constant combat in cyberspace. 

With more than 600 million attacks per day 
targeting Microsoft customers alone, there must be 
countervailing pressure to reduce the overall number 
of attacks online. Deterring this malign activity 
will require a robust combination of technological 
and geopolitical solutions. This deterrence can 
be achieved in two ways – by denial of intrusions 
or imposing consequences. While companies like 
Microsoft can help “deny” successful cyberattacks 
via innovation and further improvements in 
cybersecurity, enforcing international rules with 
deterrent consequences must fall on governments. 

Microsoft therefore urges governments to consider 
the following actions to improve adherence to 
international law and online norms by strengthening 
digital diplomacy, sharpening public attributions, 
and imposing meaningful consequences for 
cyber aggression. 

I. Strengthen international norms and 
diplomacy. Deterrence requires clear 
expectations around acceptable and 
unacceptable behavior. To that end, Microsoft 
encourages governments to embrace: 

▪ Uniformity: A single agency should handle public 
attribution statements with a standard format 
detailing the incident, responsible parties, impact, 
evidence, rule violations, consequences, and any 
preventive measures. 

▪ Collective countermeasures: Governments 

should embrace as lawful collective 
countermeasures, multiple states imposing 
countermeasures in response to illegal cyber 
operations targeting any one of them. 

▪ New norms: The United Nations (UN) and other 
forums should recognize cloud services and the 
information and communications technology 
(ICT) supply chain as critical infrastructure that is 
off\-limits to targeting. Moreover, states should be 
expected to fulfill their due diligence obligations 
to address malicious activity originating from 
within their territories. 

▪ Multistakeholder inclusion: States should 

embrace more inclusive diplomatic processes that 
ensure participation of critical non\-governmental 
stakeholders in discussions on peace and security 
online, including leading voices from the tech 
industry and civil society. 

▪ Bilateral agreements: In addition to working 

through multilateral forums, governments should 
explore potential bilateral agreements as a 
means to set expectations and curb dangerous 
cyber operations. 

II. Sharpen government attributions of malicious 
activity. Public attribution contributes to deterrence 
by calling out internationally unacceptable behavior 
and serving as a necessary precursor for imposing 
further consequences. The following are ways in 
which governments might strengthen the impact 
of public attribution statements:

▪ Contextualization: Public attributions should 
also include any broader insights into the 
threat actor’s activities to support more 
comprehensive accountability. 

▪ Collaboration: Coalition attributions by multiple 

governments help substantiate and build 
confidence in findings. Governments should 
also partner with the tech industry for further 
validation and with civil society groups to provide 
further context around impact and harms 
of cyberattacks. 

III. Impose deterrent consequences. The escalating 
volume of nation\-state sponsored cyberattacks 
necessitates more decisive governmental 
action that stems the growth. Possible response 
strategies include: 

▪ Enhanced countermeasures: Beyond public 
attribution, states conducting illegal cyber 
activities should expect firm countermeasures in 
response, this includes targeted sanctions among 
other options. 

▪ Clarify red lines: In line with the UN Charter’s 

prohibition on “threat or use of force”, it should 
be explicitly stated that state\-sponsored cyber 
intrusions that could be used to damage or 
interrupt critical civilian services constitute an 
unlawful threat of force and allow for more 
significant consequences in response. 

A more robust deterrent framework will help to 
promote stability, protect critical infrastructure, 
and avoid some of the most harmful cyberattacks. 
To support this, governments should deepen 
partnerships across stakeholder groups to identify 
the essential critical infrastructure. Given the growing 
significance of this technology, this should also 
include essential AI infrastructure and the intellectual 
property behind the development of new AI models 
that might otherwise be attractive targets for 
rival governments.

Cyber Point of View: Australia

The power of public/private partnerships

In October 2023, Microsoft and the Australian 
Signals Directorate (ASD) announced the 
Microsoft\-ASD Cyber Shield (MACS) initiative. 
This unique public\-private partnership was created 
to enhance cybersecurity collaboration between 
the two organizations to protect the Australian 
Government, businesses, and citizens. 

The MACS partnership shows how closer public 
and private sector collaboration can act as a 
force multiplier in the fight against cybercrime 
and aggression. In January 2024 for example, the 
Australian Government announced it had identified 
and issued sanctions against the perpetrators 
of a 2022 ransomware attack against Medibank, 
Australia’s largest medical insurance company 
using evidence provided by the Microsoft Threat 
Intelligence Center (MSTIC). 

Joint engineering between Microsoft and ASD also 
produced a world\-first free\-to\-download connector 
for Microsoft Sentinel customers to participate in 
the ASD’s country\-level Cyber Threat Intelligence 
Sharing (CTIS) platform. This lowered the barrier to 
entry for Sentinel customers participating in CTIS 
and strengthened the platform by enabling more 
organizations to participate, increasing the cyber 
resiliency of the country.

Election interference

The goal of some nation\-state\-backed threat actor 
groups is to influence and undermine the results of 
democratic elections. These efforts to manipulate 
electoral outcomes underscore the need for 
continued vigilance and collaboration, enhanced 
defensive measures, and content authenticity 
indicators such as content provenance.13 Defending 
elections against influence campaigns—as well as 
opportunistic cybercriminal efforts—demands a 
collective commitment from industry, media, and 
governments alike.

Nation\-state threat actors and elections 

By the end of 2024, approximately two billion people 
will have had the opportunity to vote in nationwide 
elections. The widespread accessibility of generative 
AI tools coupled with significant geopolitical events 
has created a ripe environment for nation\-state 
influence operations aimed at high\-stakes contests. 
Russia, Iran, and China all engaged in election 
influence efforts in 2024, with Russia implementing 
the most wide\-reaching, persistent campaigns and 
Iran coming into the cycle later. 

Continuing its well\-known influence efforts in 
democratic processes, Russian influence actors 
deployed a spectrum of covert and semi\-covert 
operations aimed at undermining trust in democratic 
institutions across Europe and in the United States, 
with the goal of eroding support for Ukraine. 

Iran and China, meanwhile, escalated their influence 
capabilities and objectives throughout 2024\. 
Iranian influence actors increasingly tried to influence 
elections in the Middle East and in the US, to include 
Israel’s February 2024 municipal elections and the 
US 2024 presidential election. Cyber personas run 
by Iranian influence actors sought to highlight 
vulnerabilities in Israel’s government and elections 
infrastructure as well as Prime Minister Netanyahu’s 
failure to secure voting during the election to elicit 
a sense of insecurity among Israelis. Weakness and 
vulnerability are common themes of Iranian 
influence operations, and Iran will likely continue to 
use them in upcoming elections. 

Russia, Iran, and China influence efforts converge 
on US election 

Russian influence actors launched operations 
aimed at the 2024 presidential election at a 
slower pace than in previous election cycles. 
Nevertheless, Russian influence actors Ruza Flood 
(aka Doppelganger), Volga Flood, and Storm\-1516 
demonstrated the ability to create dynamic and 
creative content aimed at American audiences. 

Ruza Flood’s US election\-themed websites, using 
names like “50 States of Lies” and “Election Watch”, 
spread anti\-Ukraine, anti\-US propaganda across 
social media platforms. Meanwhile, videos by 
Russian influence actor Storm\-1516, such as a staged 
video depicting the burning of an effigy of Donald 
Trump, received coverage from several major 
international media outlets.14 Russia also continued 
to leverage agents\-of\-influence—for example, 
resurrecting Russian agent Andrei Derkach’s NABU 
Leaks campaign, which was sanctioned by the US in 
2021 for malign influence in the 2020 election. 

In May of 2024, Iran began preparations for influence 
operations ahead of the US elections in two ways: 
conducting cyber intrusions into political accounts 
potentially for hack\-and\-leaks and launching a 
stream of polarizing content on covert news sites. 

In mid\-June, Mint Sandstorm sent a spear\-phishing 
email to a high\-ranking official of a presidential 
campaign from a compromised email account of 
a former senior advisor. Days earlier, the same 
actor, which we assess is connected to the IRGC 
intelligence unit, also unsuccessfully targeted an 
account of a former presidential candidate. 

Iran also likely ran a network of websites 
masquerading as news outlets that actively engaged 
US voter groups on opposing ends of the political 
spectrum with polarizing messaging on issues such 
as the US presidential candidates, LGBTQ rights, 
and the Israel\-Hamas conflict. Microsoft found 
evidence indicating the sites are using AI\-enabled 
services to plagiarize content from US publications. 
Examination of source code and indicators in the 
articles suggest the sites’ operators are using search 
engine optimization (SEO) plugins and generative 
AI\-based tools to create article titles and keywords 
and to automatically rephrase stolen content in a 
way that drives traffic to their sites while obfuscating 
the content’s original source. 

Meanwhile, China’s use of covert social media 
networks to sow discord ahead of the presidential 
election suggests the Chinese Communist Party 
(CCP) was emboldened by its 2022 midterm 
elections influence campaign, the first time it was 
observed attempting to interfere in a US election.

In late April, CCP\-linked influence actor Taizi Flood 
(previously Storm\-1376 and commonly referred to 
as “Spamouflage”) launched an influence campaign 
leveraging the surge of Israel\-Palestine\-related 
protests on US college campuses. Some of Taizi 
Flood’s personas on Telegram implied that they 
themselves were students or parents of students 
involved in the protests, and injected left\-leaning 
messages into right\-wing groups. They likely did so 
to sow conflict about the protests, or perhaps they 
misunderstood which audiences would be most 
receptive to their message. 

The convergence and parallel nature of nation\-state 
operations throughout 2024 underscores just how

Elections create another opportunity 
for impersonation threats

Microsoft observed a surge in election\-related 
homoglyph domains delivering phishing and 
malware payloads. We believe these domains 
are examples of cybercriminal activity driven by 
profit and reconnaissance by nation\-state threat 
actors in pursuit of their own political objectives. 
Homoglyph domains are fraudulent domains that 
exploit the similarities of alphanumeric characters 
to create deceptive domains to impersonate 
legitimate organizations. 

Threat actors use these malicious domains to 
deceive victims, often in combination with credential 
phishing and account compromise. 

During an election cycle, there is significant focus 
on domain infrastructure to host campaign content 
and mail domains to communicate with supporters 
and voters. This increase in domains creates 
opportunities for cybercriminals and nation\-state 
actors, who may use impersonation for political or 
criminal reasons.

Using data from previous attacks, the Microsoft 
Digital Crimes Unit has set up monitoring for 
domains related to elections around the world in 
an effort to detect impersonations. Our objective 
is to ensure Microsoft is not hosting malicious 
infrastructure and inform customers who might be 
victims of such impersonation threats. At present, 
we are monitoring over 10,000 homoglyph domains.

We note, however, that homoglyph domains are 
often registered by legitimate companies—either 
defensively (to prevent abuse) or for profit with the 
goal of eventually selling the domain.

Actionable Insights

1 The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA) and Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recommend 
that all election offices adopt a .gov 
domain to help mitigate impersonation 
and cybersecurity risks. This is because 
.gov domains are only available to US\-
based government organizations and 
publicly controlled entities, which helps 
the public recognize official government 
sites and emails and avoid phishing 
attempts and websites that impersonate 
government officials. 

2 Use defensive registrations of obvious 
homoglyphs of your organization’s 
domains to prevent them being used in 
a cyberattack.

Landscape and trends

Ransomware remains one of the most serious 
cybersecurity concerns. And for valid reasons. 

Among our customers, Microsoft observed a 
2\.75x increase year over year in human\-operated 
ransomware\-linked encounters (defined as having at 
least one device targeted for a ransomware attack in 
a network). 

Meanwhile, the percentage of attacks reaching 
actual encryption phase has decreased over the past 
two years by threefold. Automatic attack disruption 
contributed to this positive trend in decreasing 
successful attacks. In more than 90% of cases where 
attacks progressed to ransom stage, the attacker 
had leveraged unmanaged devices in the network, 
either to gain initial access or to remotely encrypt 

assets at the impact stage.

How cybercriminals are 
tampering with security 
products 

After compromising an organization, threat 
actors usually begin by tampering with its 
security solutions. 

By disabling or tampering with defenses, attackers 
buy themselves time to install malicious tools, 
exfiltrate data for espionage or extortion, and 
potentially launch attacks like ransomware. 

Microsoft consistently observes a prolific number 
of attacks involving antivirus tampering. In May 
2024, Microsoft Defender XDR detected over 
176,000 incidents involving tampering with security 
settings, impacting more than 5,600 organizations. 
On average, during that time frame, organizations 
that encountered tampering activity saw over 
31 attempts. 

Actionable Insights

1 Some endpoint detection and response 

(EDR) solutions provide tamper protection 
features that can help prevent attackers 
from disabling security settings. 

2 Organizations can configure the Disable 
Local Admin Merge setting to limit the 
ability to make local administration changes 
antivirus policy settings. 

3 Alerts that detect tampering tools and 
activity might precede the delivery of 
additional malware or the launch of 
malicious commands and should respond 
accordingly. As a result, these notifications 
should be actioned immediately.

In May 2024, we detected 
over 176,000 incidents 
involving tampering 
with security settings.

After gaining a foothold in a network, attackers 
conduct reconnaissance to determine security tools 
in place or they might test security measures by 
dropping tools or payloads like commodity malware. 
If detected and blocked, actors may instead 
tamper with the security products they encounter. 
Attackers generally seek to gain access to privileged 
accounts within a compromised environment so they 
can use elevated privileges to configure any policy 
settings, including security setting modification. 

Microsoft has observed various techniques to 
disable or otherwise tamper with security policies, 
including Windows Registry modifications; malicious 
tooling such as NSudo (Defeat Defender), Defender 
Control, Configure Defender, and ToggleDefender; 
custom malicious PowerShell or batch scripts and 
commands; and driver tampering.

Octo Tempest: a case study 
and a cautionary tale

A notable development in the evolution of 
ransomware attacks since last year’s report is 
the increase in hybrid attacks targeting both on\-
premises and cloud assets. 

At a time when sophisticated threat actors are 
continuing to add new tactics, techniques, and 
procedures (TTPs) to their already wide\-ranging 
playbooks, the threat actor Octo Tempest (aka 
Scattered Spider) offers a good example of this 
evolution and growth.

Octo Tempest is a financially motivated cybercriminal 
group known for wide\-ranging campaigns 
that feature adversary\-in\-the\-middle (AiTM) 
techniques, social engineering, and SIM swapping 
capabilities. First observed in 2022, it targeted 
mobile telecommunications and business process 
outsourcing organizations to initiate phone number 
ports (SIM swaps). By mid\-2023, Octo Tempest had 
become an affiliate of ALPHV/BlackCat, a human\-
operated ransomware\-as\-a\-service operation, and 
began deploying ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware 
payloads to victims. By the second quarter of 2024, 
Octo Tempest added Qilin and RansomHub to their 
ransomware payloads.

don’t have in their typical threat models, such as SMS phishing, SIM swapping, and advanced social engineering techniques.
Source: Microsoft Threat Intelligence

Octo Tempest uses extensive social engineering 
techniques, including researching an organization to 
identify targets and then impersonating employees 
or members on phone calls to trick technical 
administrators into performing password resets or 
resetting multifactor authentication (MFA) methods. 
The group also uses SIM swapping to gain access 
to an employee’s phone number and then initiate a 
self\-service password reset of the user’s account. 

Octo Tempest uses its initial access to carry out 
broad searches across the network to identify 
documents related to network architecture and 
other sensitive intelligence, then explores the 
environment to enumerate assets and resources 
across cloud environments.

The group uses device management technologies 
to push additional malicious tooling, disable/evade 
security products, or create new virtual machines 
inside the organization’s cloud. In addition to asset 
encryption, the group targets data exfiltration 
using Azure Data Factory and automated pipelines 
to extract data to its Secure File Transfer Protocol 
(SFTP) servers.

Disrupting ransomware 
threat actors 

The past year has proved once again that defeating 
ransomware threats requires a layered and multi\-
tiered approach. 

One of those tiers needs to focus on disrupting 
actors responsible for this activity in the real world. 
Microsoft teams have served as leaders in bringing 
together experts from industry and law enforcement 
to share threat intelligence and evidence about 
ransomware actors, their infrastructure, identities, 
and even finances. 

In May 2024, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI) Cyber Division identified Octo Tempest as 
its third highest priority behind China and Russia 
nation\-state threat actors. During the period covered 
in the scope of this report, Microsoft contributed 
intelligence and evidence essential to the arrest of 
multiple Octo Tempest members and other law 
enforcement disruptions of ransomware actors. 
We believe our contribution to these public\-private 
partnerships helps collectively erode the technical 
capabilities and infrastructure of the group, 
ultimately leading to its dismantlement. 

Microsoft is aggressively pursuing our ability to 
share information as authorized by law and policy to 
combat the most significant threats to our customers 
and our business. 

The US Federal Bureau of 
Investigation Cyber Division 
identified Octo Tempest 
as its third highest priority 
behind China and Russia. 

While our specific role may differ in every operation, 
Microsoft’s threat intelligence and law enforcement 
liaison capabilities are, and will continue to be, 
brought to bear against the most significant threats 
we face from criminal and nation\-state threat actors.

Combatting ransomware collectively 

In 2024 the Israel National Cyber Directorate, 
Cyber Security Council of the United Arab 
Emirates, and Microsoft Israel joined forces to 
create a collaborative threat intelligence platform, 
“Crystal Ball,” for use by the International Counter 
Ransomware initiative (CRI), a new 60\-country 
coalition. The domains of the platform are 
Attribution, Deterrence, and Culture, which address 
cybersecurity collaboration between nations. 

The Crystal Ball Platform is designed for modern 
work with embedded security, automation, and 
AI. The platform also considers data residency 
and geographic regions to meet the regulatory 
standards of the CRI partners. As of June 2024, 
more than 10 countries are using and sharing 
intelligence on the platform, with the goal to 
onboard the remaining CRI members by the 
end of 2024\.

Fraud 

Landscape and trends 

Incidents of fraud and abuse are increasing globally 
in both volume and sophistication. Fraud is a form of 
cybercrime and it undermines the security, trust, and 
reputation of individuals, businesses, and organizations 
of all sizes and types, in every region and industry. 

From nation\-state actors to cybergangs to lone 
fraudsters, malicious actors exploit vulnerabilities in 
services, programs, online properties, promotions, 
and systems to obtain fraudulent access. They use 
gained resources for cyberattacks, financial crimes, 
or reselling assets. The World Economic Forum22 
reports scammers stole over $1 trillion US globally 
from victims in 2023\. This means companies lost 
an average of 1\.5% in profits due to fraud,23 while 
consumers faced a staggering $8\.8 billion US in 
losses—up 30% from 2022\. 

In an era where digital transformation accelerates 
almost every type of business operations, the ingenuity 
and scalability of fraud tactics continues to challenge 
resilience around the world. Organizations face 
a barrage of scams, such as payment and quick 
response (QR) code fraud, business email compromise 
(BEC), AiTM, video phishing, and investment scam 
techniques such as “pig butchering.” 

At the same time, the fight against impersonation 
is getting significantly more difficult due to the 
increasing ease of access to deep\-fake technology, 
which enables cybercriminals to create highly 
convincing forgeries of not only the voices of 
business leaders but even video. 

The shift to cloud\-based computing is proving 
a double\-edged sword. While cloud computing 
provides scalability, elasticity, cost savings, and 
enhanced computational capabilities that drive 
innovation, it grants these same advantages to 
malicious actors, amplifying their potential for 
misconduct. Microsoft has observed fraudsters 
using cloud services to launch attacks, steal data, 
impersonate users, launder money, and evade 
detection. These activities are used in various 
types of fraud such as account takeover, domain 
typo\-squatting, payment fraud, and other types of 
cloud impersonation. 

As discussed on the following pages, Microsoft 
collaborates with law enforcement, industry 
partners, and customers to actively combat these 
illegal activities, to protect and uphold the rights of 
our customers.

The ever\-growing threat of cyber\-enabled 
financial fraud 

Cyber\-enabled financial fraud covers a range of 
fraudulent activities facilitated by the internet, 
including investment scams, BEC, and tech 
support scams. 

According to the FBI, losses due to investment 
scams have surpassed all other online fraud types, 
accounting for more than $4\.5 billion US in losses in 
2023 alone.24 

Teams at Microsoft, LinkedIn, and Skype are 
advancing efforts to proactively detect such 
criminal activities, and Microsoft suspended 
upwards of 64 million abusive service accounts 
in 2023\. We are also working with industry and 
law enforcement partners to disrupt these actors 
in the real world. In addition, we are currently 
working with law enforcement partners to improve 
intelligence exchange on cyber threats to dismantle 
criminal operations. 

For example, in May 2024, Microsoft worked with 
the Indian Cybercrime Control Center to shut down 
over 1,000 Skype accounts involved in harassment, 
blackmail, extortion, and fake “digital arrests” by 
fraudsters impersonating police and other officials.25 

The Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit combats 
financially motivated cybercrime using pioneering 
legal strategies, state\-of\-the\-art technology, and 
collaboration to counteract threats to consumers. 

Microsoft also works to undermine cybercriminals 
by proactively dismantling their operational 
infrastructure, disrupting their financial motivation, 
and partnering with organizations like the US 
National Cyber Forensics and Training Alliance 
and the Japan Cybercrime Control Center to 
enhance sharing of actionable intelligence. As the 
world recognizes the persistent threat of cyber\-
enabled crime, we are seeing more public and 
private partners joining forces to disrupt criminal 
infrastructure, hold them to account, and support 
victims of cybercrime. 

Authorities conducted searches at seven locations 
across India, intercepting live cybercriminal 
operations and gathering substantial evidence, 
including computer hard disks, mobile phones, and 
laptops, along with details of financial transactions, 
call recordings, and transcripts. A total of 43 
individuals have been arrested in this operation, 
with many others still under investigation. The CBI, 
in coordination with the FBI and international law 
enforcement agencies, continues to trace the 
network’s operations and financial activities to 
identify and apprehend additional suspects in this 
ongoing investigation. 

Our collaboration with law enforcement to combat 
cyber\-enabled fraud has resulted in 30\+ call center 
raids, 100\+ arrests, and increasingly severe prison 
sentences worldwide.26 

In October 2023, Microsoft and Amazon joined 
forces to combat a cybercriminal network 
conducting tech support fraud against more 
than 2,000 customer organizations globally. 
Following a joint investigation, we provided India’s 
Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) a criminal 
referral identifying multiple companies, call 
centers, and individuals that directly contributed to 
“Operation Chakra II,” a law enforcement operation of 
more than 75 criminal raids across India to dismantle 
organized cyber\-enabled financial crimes.27 

Despite efforts by law enforcement and partners in 
the public and private sector, the complexity, speed, 
impact and severity of cybercrime is escalating. 

Cybercriminals are leveraging the growing 
cybercrime\-as\-a\-service (CaaS) ecosystem as well 
as AI technologies to launch phishing and social 
engineering attacks at scale. Simultaneously, they 
are increasingly evading security measures like 
multifactor authentication (MFA) to conduct targeted 
attacks. As a result, the battle against cyber\-enabled 
financial fraud requires a multi\-faceted response. 
Enhancing cooperation and strengthening detection 
and prevention measures are key areas of focus. 
Public awareness, vigilance, and the facilitation 
of fraud reporting are also vital components in 
preventing these crimes and mitigating their impact.

Introduction Nation\-state threats Ransomware 

Fraud 

Identity and social engineering DDoS attacks 

Traditional methods, such as exploiting large\-scale 
data breaches, remain prevalent, enabling fraudsters 
to bypass identity validations and access extensive 
personal data. The growth of the CaaS economy 
also simplifies the execution of complex fraud 
schemes by providing ready access to stolen data 
and fraudulent tools. Concurrently, we’re observing a 
shift away from older hacking techniques in favor of 
methods like phishing and spoofing to compromise 
credentials and gain access to payment instruments. 

Generative AI accelerates the creation of fake 
identity elements, such as high\-quality images, 
deepfakes, and voice impersonations, making 
it easier to deceive merchants and individuals. 
This falsified identity information can either disguise 
the fraudster’s true identity or impersonate a 
victim to fool a merchant, or impersonate a trusted 
contact to fool a victim. Such deception can trick 
a merchant’s risk engine during transactions or, if 
initially detected, can persuade customer support 
to override the rejection. Consequently, this enables 
fraudsters to unlawfully obtain goods or services 
using stolen payment methods. 

Novel trends and nightmare scenarios 
in the world of e\-commerce 

Even as card\-present payment security improves 
through mobile wallet, Europay, Mastercard, and 
Visa (EMV) chip, and near\-field communication 
(NFC) technologies, fraudsters remain attracted to 
the e\-commerce or card\-not\-present (CNP) space, in 
which payment cards are not physically present for 
the transactions. 

By 2028, the annual losses attributed to e\-commerce 
payment fraud globally are expected to surpass 
$90 billion US,28 with merchants and financial 
institutions bearing much of that economic impact. 

Card security has seen numerous advances 
including MFA, tokenization,29 and the expansion of 
address verification services. However, issues with 
interoperability and incomplete implementation of 
planned improvements prevent these technologies 
from being universally adopted. 

In the past year, Microsoft conducted over 
1\.6 billion risk evaluations for potential payment 
fraud and rejected $1\.58 billion US in fraudulent 
transaction requests. We’ve observed a rise 
in sophisticated fraud tactics targeting online 
transaction vulnerabilities, including web interface 
breaches, phishing, spoofing, and synthetic identity 
generation to steal credentials and payment 
instrument information. 

Actionable Insights 

1 

Incorporate AI and machine learning 
(ML) models into existing policies 
and rules to detect unusual transaction 
patterns and flag potentially fraudulent 
activities in real\-time. 

2 When using voice as a factor for 

authentication, be sure to incorporate 
additional factors due to the rise of AI 
audio models capable of reproducing 
individual voices. 

3 Apply risk\-based containment strategies 

using tiered product access and customer 
behavior monitoring to manage malicious 
use of AI and fake identities. 

4 Deploy robust authentication measures 
to verify payment credentials and use 
tokenization to eliminate the need to store 
full card numbers. 

5 Collaborate with industry partners using 
secure technologies like confidential 
computing and clean room environments 
to enhance data sharing and fraud 
prevention while protecting privacy. 

6 Enhance authentication with phish\-

resistant FIDO. 

In addition to the above general trends, Microsoft 
has observed the following specific methods used in 
e\-commerce payment fraud: 

▪ Enumeration techniques pose significant risks in 
e\-commerce as regulatory compliance does not 
mandate the protection of all digits in the 16\-digit 
card schema, allowing some digits to be guessed. 
Fraudsters use public payment schemas and 
automated methods to deduce authentication 
details like Card Verification Value (CVV) codes 
or expiration dates. Once they generate valid 
payment credentials, these can be sold on the 
dark web. 

▪ Biometric spoofing and the creation of synthetic 
identities using generative AI are increasing 
threats. AI\-generated deepfakes can bypass 
biometric security in many mobile payment 
methods relying on biometrics technologies 
native to hardware and operating systems. 
Additionally, fraudsters use AI to craft realistic 
synthetic identities to manipulate merchant 
customer support functions.

Phishing 

Top email phishing types 

Phishing remains a perennial cybersecurity threat. 
According to TrendMicro, phishing attacks increased 
by 58% in 2023, with an estimated financial impact 
of $3\.5 billion US in 2024\.30 

Threat actors continue to use longstanding and new 
TTPs to access targets, but a growing concern this 
year is the misuse of legitimate web services and 
tools for phishing deployment. 

Software\-as\-a\-Service (SaaS)\-based email, developer 
tools, captcha services, cloud storage, click tracking, 
marketing platforms, customer survey platforms, 
lesser known email clients, and backup and mass 
emailing tools have all been weaponized for a range 
of malicious activities. One of the key advantages 
of using these services is that they can evade 
detection systems because they are less likely to be 
preemptively blocked due to their established levels 
of trust and legitimate usage. Additionally, many 
phishing campaigns combine the use of multiple 
legitimate services simultaneously, complicating 
the detection process for both human analysts and 
automated systems.

QR code phishing 

QR codes have become much more prevalent since the 
pandemic and therefore more trusted by users. By their 
nature, QR codes obscure the destination from 
the user. Around mid\-September 2023, Microsoft 
analysts observed a significant increase in phishing 
attempts using these codes, which presents a unique 
challenge for security providers as they appear 
as an image during mail flow and are unreadable 
until rendered. 

In QR code phishing, threat actors send phishing 
messages containing a code encoded with a URL. 
The message prompts the recipient to scan the QR 
code with their device, redirecting them to a fake 
sign\-in page where they are prompted to input their 
credentials. This page may include AiTM capabilities 
that circumvent some forms of MFA. 

Of note, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 image 
detection technology significantly disrupted QR 
code phishing attacks, causing a 94% decrease in 
phishing emails using this attack technique between 
October 2023\-March 2024\. Threat actors continually 
adapt their attacks in response to effective detection 
and blocking, returning to older, more well\-known 
tactics or spending time and effort to innovate 
new techniques. Disruption of effective techniques 
such as QR code phishing is an important part 
of network and data protection. While QR codes 
that are plain and square with a black and white 
barcode persist in phishing attacks, since more 
effective detection and blocking has successfully 
reduced their efficacy, threat actors have resorted to 
experimenting with different QR code visualizations. 
For example, QR codes comprised of a blue barcode 
on a red background became commonplace 
in phishing attacks until that variation, too, was 
rendered ineffective. 

By their nature, QR codes 
obscure the destination from 
the user, which creates a 
challenge for security teams. 

Other attempts to confuse image processing 
include placing a black border around the QR 
code or putting the QR code in an attachment. 
Although effective detection and blocking measures 
greatly reduced the volume of QR code phishing 
attacks from the millions of messages observed in 
2023, actors continued to test new techniques and 
innovate old ones throughout 2024 to find ways to 
evade protections and impact organizations. 

During April and May 2024, there was a surge in 
phishing attempts targeting Microsoft Teams users. 
The attackers created a new tenant and registered 
a domain specifically for this attack. These attacks 
often included QR codes within the messages, 
which, upon scanning, directed users to AiTM 
phishing sites. Common themes in these phishing 
campaigns involved impersonating Office, Microsoft, 
or Security services.

Introduction Nation\-state threats Ransomware 

Fraud 

Identity and social engineering DDoS attacks 

Business email compromise (BEC) 

BEC attacks remain a prevalent threat, with inbox 
rule manipulation the favored method. 

Inbox rule manipulation: A new variation has 
emerged involving manipulation through API/App 
usage. Instead of using the usual “New\-InboxRule” 
or “Set\-InboxRule” commands, the attackers now 
use “UpdateInboxRules”. This allows them to redirect 
emails with keywords related to credentials or 
financial matters to less monitored folders like Spam, 
Conversation History, or Deleted Items, hiding their 
fraudulent activity from the user’s immediate view. 

BEC lateral phishing: After compromising an 
account, attackers aim to move laterally within the 
organization, targeting multiple users to either 
gain access to high\-privilege accounts or trick 
users into paying fake invoices. This is achieved 
by sending phishing emails to other users within 
the organization. 

Conversation hijacking: The attacker compromises 
the sender’s email account and injects themself 
into an existing email thread using a similar\-looking 
account, keeping the sender’s display name 
unchanged. The hijacked account domain is usually 
newly created for financially motivated scams to 
lure users. 

MFA tampering post AiTM attack: 
After compromising a user account, the attacker 
attempts to add an additional device for MFA, 
such as a phone number to approve two\-factor 
authorization or registering a new device with 
an authenticator, to maintain ongoing access. 

Targeted BEC: Personalized phishing campaigns are 
crafted using local languages, targeting IT, finance, 
and legal departments with specific topics such 
as “software updates” or “tax submissions.” This 
tailored strategy significantly boosts compromise 
success rates. 

Other noteworthy post\-compromise 
behaviors observed 

Legitimate applications abuse: We observed three 
new legitimate tools being abused by adversaries for 
mailbox exfiltration and BEC. 

▪ PerfectData Software: An application integrated 
with Microsoft 365/Azure to provide a mailbox 
and backup services. Threat actors used it 
to secretly access and steal mailboxes from 
compromised users. 

▪ Newsletter Software Supermailer: Legitimate 

software used to create and send personalized 
bulk emails and newsletters. Adversaries exploited 
it to conduct lateral phishing attacks from 
compromised user accounts. 

▪ eMClient: A desktop email client for Windows 
and macOS. Adversaries used this to exfiltrate 
mailboxes from compromised users. 

Low and slow BEC: Attackers discreetly read a small 
number of emails (between two to five) daily, and 
sparingly accessed OneDrive/SharePoint files, all 
in an effort to evade detection. These low\-profile 
attacks challenged detection systems, which could 
identify them only by correlating with unusual sign\-
in activities.

Actionable Insights 

1 Even if a tool seems familiar, don’t assume 

it is safe. In the past year, Microsoft 
identified a new trend where adversaries 
were misusing three legitimate tools for 
malicious activities. 

2 Attacks are more sophisticated. 
Another notable trend is the 
personalization of phishing campaigns 
and outbound communications using 
local languages. 

3 QR code phishing is on the rise but 

effective detection and blocking measures 
can greatly reduce the volume of attacks. 

4 Shadow IT, or pieces of hardware or 

software that users install without the 
approval of the IT department, are a 
threat to the organizations and make 
them vulnerable to phishing and post\-
compromise activities. IT teams should 
periodically scan the infrastructure to 
detect unauthorized software or hardware 
and take remedial actions.

Introduction Nation\-state threats Ransomware 

Fraud 

Identity and social engineering DDoS attacks 

Impersonation 

Impersonation is a key method used by fraud actors 
to gain trust from their victims. While it takes many 
forms, impersonation of legitimate companies is a 
risk both to customers and to the reputation of the 
business. As we look across the world of corporate 
impersonation, Microsoft has seen fraud actors 
increase sophistication and speed across the board. 

Deepfakes 

Most AI\-generated synthetic media, also known as 
“deepfakes,” target either communities (for example, 
false news reports) or individuals (scams). 

As with other impersonation\-based threats, 
deepfakes exist on a spectrum of sophistication. 
At its most basic, for example, a threat actor could 
use shallow fakes in email and text messages 
designed to convince workers that a superior or 
colleague needs them to take an action. However, 
the significant rise in sophistication on the 
horizon will produce major changes, including in 
identity verification.

 54% 

of phishing campaigns targeting 
consumers impersonated online 
software and service brands 

Sectors impersonated in consumer phish 

According to Gartner, by 2026, 30% of enterprises 
expect to no longer consider facial biometric identity 
verification and authentication solutions to be 
reliable in isolation. 

On the other hand, plausible alternate domain 
registration involves adding words or changing the 
top\-level domain (TLD) to trick users. For instance, 
registering a domain like “contoso.store”. 

As deepfakes become more common in the business 
environment, organizations will have to implement 
countermeasures, such as requiring additional 
verification for transactions. At the same time, 
Microsoft is exploring provenance solutions to help 
increase transparency of online digital content.31 

Corporate impersonation 

Domain spoofing involves various classic techniques 
that enable impersonation of corporate entities. 
One such technique is the look\-alike domains 
we identified earlier: homoglyph domains. 
The imposters rely on users not noticing the slight 
variation the characters used in the domain name, 
such as using zero instead of the letter “O” in a 
domain name. By tricking users into clicking links or 
visiting these fraudulent websites, the threat actors 
can deceive them into sharing sensitive information, 
potentially resulting in financial or identity theft. 

Fraudsters have doubled down on various forms 
of impersonating domains including homoglyphs, 
sub\-domain squatting, and plausible alternate 
domain registration. Sub\-domain squatting involves 
setting up a sub\-domain in a cloud service under a 
trustworthy name to carry out email\-based attacks, 
such as using “contoso.onmicrosoft.com” as a 
sub\-domain. 

Microsoft has begun piloting Entra Verified ID as 
an element of advanced identity proofing, requiring 
users to share government\-issued ID in situations 
where the authenticity of their identity is in question. 
Initial results indicate this control is having promising 
results, effectively preventing the majority of 
corporate impersonation attempts. As we continue 
to train the models and build for scale, we expect to 
further improve these results. 

Actionable Insights 

1 Educate employees to be on the lookout 

for impersonated domains. 

2 When enabling accounts and services, use 
of verified identity models and AI detection 
can significantly reduce the risk of allowing 
fraudulent access. 

3 Educate employees about how to check 

content integrity.

A majority of phishing campaigns targeting consumers 
this year impersonated online software and service 
brands. This comes as no surprise given the value to 
attackers in compromising and exploiting consumer 
accounts on platforms that can span social media, 
cloud storage, email, e\-commerce, and more. 
Phishing will become less prevalent and less profitable 
for attackers as more consumers adopt strong MFA 
and passwordless technology.

The dire state of techscam 

Techscam refers to fraudulent activities or scams 
that make your computer vulnerable to additional 
malicious activities. Microsoft has identified 
that most techscams originate from malicious 
advertisement platforms. There are a variety 
of techscam types, each with its own unique 
modus operandus: 

▪ Microsoft Support techscam/McAfee/Apple 
techscam: These scams impersonate legitimate 
support services from industry leading tech 
companies to deceive users into providing 
sensitive information or making payments for 
non\-existent issues. 

▪ Cryptocurrency/fake shopping: Scammers use 
malicious advertisements to promote fraudulent 
cryptocurrency schemes or fake shopping deals, 
luring users into financial traps. 

▪ Malicious browser extension scam: These 
scams trick users into installing browser 
extensions that can manipulate search results, 
display intrusive ads, or steal personal data. 

▪ Malicious browser notification scam: Users are 
misled into allowing browser notifications from 
malicious sites, which then bombard them with 
misleading alerts or phishing attempts. 

In the realm of cloud services, 
we saw a significant uptick in 
techscam traffic, with a daily 
frequency surging from 7,000 
in 2023 to 100,000 in 2024, 
an over twelvefold increase. 

The current landscape of techscam is alarming, with 
SmartScreen traffic statistics from 2022 to 2024 
indicating that over 90% of malicious traffic in the 
Edge browser is attributed to techscam activities. 

Among techscam frameworks, investment and 
cryptocurrency scams and technical support scams 
have incurred the highest financial losses globally. 
Overall, techscams have 10 times the financial impact 
of phishing. 

The transient nature of malicious hosts on cloud 
servers—such as Azure, DigitalOcean, and 
CloudFront—poses a significant challenge to 
detection and neutralization. Cloud servers provide 
an easy and cost\-effective way to create host pages. 
Moreover, over 70% of malicious entities are active 
for less than two hours, meaning they may be gone 
before they’re even detected. This rapid turnover 
rate underscores the need for more agile and 
effective cybersecurity measures. 

Microsoft researchers are building a new AI 
detection model to detect scams with a local small 
language model, protecting the first victim that 
sees a scam and reporting scams to SmartScreen to 
protect other users. 

Microsoft researchers are also developing client\-
side signals to analyze the visual and structural 
elements of techscam pages. This new capability 
has significant detection potential, especially 
since techscam incidents are often short\-lived. 
This feature enables us to identify threats more 
quickly, dramatically increasing the efficiency of our 
techscam detection abilities. 

Actionable Insights 

1 Preemptively block known malicious 

domains by creating a blocklist based 
on the domain architectures—such as 
IP, Whois, and PDNS (protective domain 
name system)—and redirector chains’ 
information in telemetry logs commonly 
used in techscam operations. 

2 Perform continuous updates on this 

dynamic use of blocklists to stay ahead of 
scammers’ evolving tactics.

Account takeovers (ATOs) 

In the business\-to\-consumer world there has been a 
steady pace of account hacking, identity theft, and 
payment instrument abuse in context of ATOs. 

Threat actors prey on the least protected accounts 
and the most vulnerable individuals, so consistently 
raising the bar on account protection is important. 
While the best practice for consumers is to have and 
keep current MFA while being vigilant about account 
monitoring, a whole industry has developed to help 
mitigate the impacts of successful compromises. 

In recent years, industry reports have indicated 
an increasing threat in the business\-to\-business 
world and the arena of managed online services. 
Because compromise of the latter may impact the 
downstream customers of client businesses, this 
adds another layer of complexity and risk.

and verified credentials. 
Source: Microsoft Central Fraud and Abuse Risk Team 

According to one study, 29% of internet users 
have now experienced ATO, up from 22% in 2021\.32 
Business account takeovers rose from 13% to 21% in 
the same period. 

According to Microsoft’s trend monitoring, many 
Microsoft accounts that were taken over last year 
did not follow basic account security best practices, 
like using MFA. Despite the emergence of more 
advanced hacking techniques, most ATOs still 
happen through simple methods like password 
spraying, phishing, keylogging, and using passwords 
from previous attacks found on the web. 

Recently, Microsoft has experienced a surge 
in attacks on “generic,” “group,” or “multiuser” 
accounts. These accounts typically have outdated 
passwords, and the original user may no longer be 
monitoring them. Generic accounts are commonly 
used by administrators for ease of maintenance but 
are harder to secure. Implementing effective multi\-
factor authentication is challenging, and identifying 
compromises through pattern recognition 
becomes difficult when multiple users have access. 
Additionally, account recovery for service providers is 
problematic, making it challenging to restore hacked 
accounts to their rightful owners. 

Actionable Insights 

1 Keeping account security up to the latest 
standards is critical to protecting yourself 
from ATO risk. 

2 Hackers look for weak security and 

seasonal opportunities when account 
owners are not focused on monitoring, to 
scale their attacks. 

3 Consider moving your user base to an 
authentication app to enable an easy 
upgrade to new standards for MFA as 
they release.

Identity and social engineering DDoS attacks 

Identity and social engineering 

Insights on identity 
attacks and trends 

As organizations move to the cloud and adopt SaaS 
applications, identities are becoming increasingly 
crucial for accessing resources. 

Cybercriminals exploit legitimate and authorized 
identities to steal confidential data, and access 
credentials in various ways like phishing, malware, 
data breaches, brute\-force/password spray attacks, 
and prior compromises. 

As in past years, password\-based attacks on 
users constitute most identity\-related attacks, 
supported by massive infrastructure that threat 
actors have dedicated to combing the digital world 
for passwords. 

7,000 

password attacks blocked 
per second over the past year 

Microsoft Entra data shows that of more than 
600 million identity attacks per day, more than 99% 
are password\-based. Advances such as default 
security configurations and Conditional Access 
policies have helped more organizations embrace 
multifactor authentication (MFA), increasing 
adoption to 41% among Microsoft enterprise 
customers.33 

However, as MFA blocks most password\-based 
attacks, threat actors are shifting their focus, moving 
up the cyberattack chain in three ways: 

1 Attacking infrastructure 

2 Bypassing authentication 

3 Exploiting applications 

Attacks on identity infrastructure 
in the spotlight 

Infrastructure attacks have become popular with 
sophisticated actors, both nation\-state and criminal. 

They can be difficult to detect without careful 
configuration monitoring, AI\-driven threat detection, 
and log analysis. Once a threat actor infiltrates an 
organization’s infrastructure, they make changes to 
maintain persistence and remain unnoticed. 

For example, they may steal credentials to 
impersonate a non\-human identity, elevate its 
permissions for a few seconds to create new 
credentials used to access and steal data, then return 
the application’s identity to its previous state. 

Actionable Insights 

1 Employ advanced monitoring and threat 

detection that uses AI to recognize 
outlier patterns. 

2 Carefully monitor access and configuration 

changes to identity infrastructure. 

3 Enhance monitoring for devices 
and networks on which identity 
infrastructure depends.

Actionable Insights 

1 Retire passwords in favor of phishing\-
resistant, passwordless authentication 
methods such as passkeys. 

2 Require all users to run on their devices as 
standard users and not as administrators. 

3 Only allow access from managed and 

compliant devices. 

4 Mitigate AiTM and token theft attacks 
with policies that require interactive 
strong authentication when anomalies 
are detected. 

5 Use access policies to require token 
protection and prevent access from 
untrusted environments. 

6 To reduce time to mitigation and increase 

detection capability, adopt applications that 
support continuous access evaluation. 

Exploiting applications to access high\-
value resources 

Threat actors are taking advantage of abandoned, 
unmonitored, and overprivileged cloud\-based 
applications with insecure credentials so they can 
access high\-value resources. 

Most organizations carry substantial security debt 
in such applications. For example, developers may 
enable broad permissions and check credentials 
into code to facilitate application development and 
testing but then fail to correct these issues before 
the application ships. 

In the past year, Microsoft found only 2\.6% of 
workload identity permissions were used and 51% of 
workload identities were completely inactive. 

Between January and June 2024, we detected 
over 1\.5 million credentials (such as passwords or 
certificates) discoverable by attackers in locations 
such as source code repositories. In fact, 18% of code 
repositories we examined in the past year exposed 
such secrets. 

These statistics underscore the importance of secure 
development practices, which include preventing 
secrets in code, securing test environments, 
minimizing permissions for applications, and 
retiring unused applications and tenants. Just as 
using phishing\-resistant credentials greatly reduces 
the risk of identity compromise, using managed 
service identities eliminates the risk associated with 
managing service credentials in code. 

Actionable Insights 

1 Use managed service identities instead of 

developer shared secrets. 

2 Govern permissions to ensure identities, 

including workload identities, have only the 
privileges they need. 

3 Secure test environments and retire unused 

applications and tenants. 

Threat actors are bypasssing MFA, using 
innovative AiTM phishing attacks and 
token theft 

As we highlighted last year, as organizations 
strengthen their authentication protocols with MFA, 
threat actors are pivoting to AiTM phishing attacks 
and to token theft. Token theft occurs after a user 
successfully authenticates and receives a valid token. 
The attacker then steals the token from the victim’s 
device, from compromised routers or proxies, or 
from application or network logs. Although token 
theft results in far fewer identity compromises 
than password attacks, our detections indicate 
incidents have grown to an estimated 39,000 per 
day. Moreover, over the last year we’ve seen a 
146% rise in AiTM phishing attacks, which occur 
when attackers trick users into clicking a link and 
completing MFA on the attacker’s behalf.

Outdated security programs leave configurations

specific applications. Password\-only authentication 
configurations, exacerbated by archaic expiry and 
complexity policies, result in more than 99% of

rely on protocols such as IMAP, POP, and basic 
authentications that were once necessary but 
have long been replaced by modern protocols 
such as Open Authorization (OAuth) and OpenID 
Connect (OIDC).

“Secure by default” settings reduce 
identity compromises 

Although modern MFA techniques reduce the risk of 
identity compromise by 99\.2%, many organizations 
have been slow to adopt them. So, in January 
2020, Microsoft introduced “security defaults” that 
turn on MFA while turning off basic and legacy 
authentication for new tenants and those with simple 
environments. The impact is clear: tenants that use 
security defaults experience 80% fewer compromises 
than tenants that don’t. 

In November 2023, we started deploying Microsoft\-
managed Conditional Access policies for existing 
tenants with more complicated environments. 
We then started enforcing three MFA\-related 
policies in March 2024\. Even among these more 
sophisticated tenants with these policies, the 
compromise rate has decreased by 39%. 

This “secure by default” approach represents a 
critical mindset shift for security professionals: 
instead of “dialing up” security to where it’s “safe,” 
we must start at the maximum level of security 
possible, then dial back as necessary. It’s both 
harder and less effective to start at zero security and 
assemble it layer by layer than to start at 100 percent 
security and then customize the configuration to 
specific business needs. 

Actionable Insights 

1 Enable MFA in all your tenants. 

2 Enable phishing\-resistant MFA for 

your admins. 

3 For all new tenants, start with the strongest 

security settings possible.

Introduction Nation\-state threats Ransomware

Identity and social engineering DDoS attacks 

Social engineering 
“next generation” 

Regardless of the technique, social engineering 
remains a constant threat that ultimately 
cannot be fully mitigated via technology. 
Training and education, both at the helpdesk and 
user level, is central to preventing successful social 
engineering attacks. 

Teams and Skype phishing 

In recent years, there has been a significant rise in 
novel phishing techniques like the use of QR codes 
discussed earlier. Another of these techniques is 
the use of collaboration platforms such as Teams or 
Skype to phish users. Microsoft has observed threat 
actors using a previously compromised tenant to 
create a new onmicrosoft.com tenant with a tech 
support theme. These tenants are then abused to 
send malicious files, links, and requests for users to 
provide credentials or obtain MFA approvals. 

Beginning in July 2023, threat actors began 
sending Teams users attachments hosted on an 
actor\-controlled SharePoint tenant. In these cases, 
the target tenant had been configured to allow 
messages from users outside of the organization. 
In April 2024, Midnight Blizzard masqueraded as 
Microsoft Security on Teams, providing targets a 
link for AiTM credential harvesting. That month and 
the next, attackers impersonated Microsoft Office, 
Microsoft Security, or Microsoft in general to phish 

Regardless of the technique, social 
engineering remains a constant 
threat that ultimately cannot be 
fully mitigated via technology. 

Teams users, often with QR codes that directed users 
to AiTM sites. In some cases, attackers had already 
obtained credentials through password spray attacks 
and sent a two\-factor authentication request via 
Teams, prompting the target to provide the number 
in the authentication app. A sense of urgency was 
the key in these attacks since the tokens were valid 
only for a few minutes. 

From April onwards, there was an uptick in social 
engineering attacks through Teams. Attackers posed 
as Help Desk or IT support staff and persuaded users 
to establish remote monitoring and management 
(RMM) connections with the attacker’s system, 
leading to ransomware incidents. In all these Teams\-
related instances, the attacks were conducted 
through one\-on\-one conversations, originating 
from newly created attacker\-owned tenants. 
SharePoint was frequently utilized by the attackers as 
the preferred platform for hosting malicious files. 

SIM swapping 

The growing acceptance of MFA has forced threat 
actors to impersonate users as a workaround. As a 
result, Microsoft has observed SIM swapping gaining 
popularity in recent years, led by Octo Tempest. 

In SIM swapping, the threat actor contacts a mobile 
carrier and gets a target victim’s SIM card moved 
to their own device. To do this, the actor must first 
collect personal information about the target to 
answer the security questions necessary to gain 
access to the target’s account. 

Once the actor has control of the victim’s SIM, they 
can receive MFA codes and one\-time passcodes. 
Operational security on the part of individuals 
is crucial in preventing this kind of attack. 
Individuals should monitor their online footprint to 
see what information is publicly available about them 
that a threat actor could use to impersonate them.

Helpdesk social engineering 

Microsoft has observed an uptick in threat actors 
contacting helpdesks, impersonating a user 
to obtain a password reset or register a new 
MFA device. 

In the last year, more than half of all Microsoft 
Incident Response engagements attributed to Octo 
Tempest were able to be tracked back to helpdesk 
social engineering. Helpdesks have begun to counter 
this by requiring further levels of verification such 
as video calls, but as noted earlier in this chapter, 
the rise of deepfakes will enable a threat actor 
to impersonate the voice, image, and video of a 
victim, making even this identity verification avenue 
more difficult. 

Threat actors such as Octo Tempest have also 
been observed communicating directly with senior 
executives and other individuals involved in an 
investigation as part of their extortion campaign or 
in an effort to gain access to credentials. In cases 
where extortion is part of the attack, threat actors 
may also use text messages to pressure victims 
into paying.

AiTM credential phishing 

Credential phishing attacks with AiTM capabilities 
are continually observed by Microsoft through daily, 
high\-volume email campaigns sent from phishing\-
as\-a\-service (PhaaS) platforms. 

In 2024 to date, the top five kits by email volume 
were: Caffeine, Tycoon, Greatness, NakedPages, and 
Dadsec. Each of these PhaaS services represents 
tens to hundreds of millions of phishing messages 
observed each month. 

While the top phishing services are largely the same 
in 2024 as 2023, there have been some changes. 
For example, in November and December 2023, 
the Dadsec service disappeared from our tracking. 
In January 2024, the creator and operator of the 
Dadsec PhaaS platform, Storm\-1575, resurfaced 
and announced a rebrand of the service as 
“Rockstar2FA.” Operations of the new service 
continued mostly as before, with intermittent 
updates to phishing attachments, messages, or 
infrastructure to evade detection efforts and a new 
communications channel for clients. 

In May 2024, Storm\-1101, the actor behind the 
NakedPages PhaaS platform, announced they 
would be permanently winding down their 
operations. The actor claimed they had provided 
the NakedPages source code to some individuals 
who had worked as support for the NakedPages 
service. At least one of these individuals has since 
started their own phishing service based on that 
source code. 

In January 2024, Caffeine was rebranded to ONNX. 
Communication channels for the kit’s operations 
were changed and the service began allowing 
customers to use their own domains in April, 
making it harder to track activity related to the kit. 
While Caffeine/ONNX was the most prominent 
AiTM phishing service by volume of phishing 
messages observed through the first half of 2024, it 
was supplanted by Tycoon in May. In June, Caffeine 
owner and operator Storm\-0867’s identity was 
revealed in a blogpost from DarkAtlas,34 resulting in 
an abrupt cessation of operations. 

The use of HTML attachments to deliver URLs or 
phishing pages to recipients continued to be a 
popular tactic among phishing actors in the last 
year. The attached HTML file may contain a URL that 
sends the recipient to a phish landing page or it may 
contain code that reaches out to an actor\-controlled 
server to download a phishing page and present it 
to the recipient upon opening the file. HTML files 
may also be contained within ZIP files, Microsoft 
Office files, additional—sometimes multiple—email 
files attached to the initial email, or other file types 
to evade detection. 

PDF attachments also continued to be a popular 
vector for phishing. Usually, the PDF contained a 
URL leading to a phish landing page, likely through 
a multi\-step process including a redirection URL 
through a legitimate or abused service and/or a 
captcha check. Occasionally, the link went straight to 
a phishing domain. Like the HTML vector, a PDF file 
may be included within multiple layers of other email 
files, ZIP files, other filetypes or may be hosted on a 
legitimate filesharing service accessed through a URL 
provided in the original email. 

In the time it takes you to 
read this sentence we will 
have defended against 27,860 
individual password attacks.

Stormy skies: the rise of 
cloud identity compromise 

With more organizations moving to hybrid or cloud\-
only models, it is becoming increasingly important to 
secure both cloud resources and cloud identities. 

Identity is a central piece in a functional 
organization’s cloud environment and represents 
a critical target for attackers. An attacker who 
manipulates identity can also manipulate any 
resource or process that identity is trusted to access, 
including email, other cloud services, or the on\-
premises environment. 

In the past, cloud identity compromise was thought 
to be reserved for only a handful of advanced, 
perhaps exclusively state\-sponsored, actors. 
However, financially motivated actors like Octo 
Tempest, Storm\-0539, and Storm\-0501 have recently 
shown sophisticated competency in the cloud across 
a large variety of industry verticals, indicating that 
more and more threat actors will be able to use 
this technique. 

In Octo Tempest cloud attacks identified by 
Microsoft Threat Intelligence, this prolific threat actor 
targeted federated identity providers using tools 
like AADInternals to federate domains. The actor 
then used the newly federated identity provider 
to sign in as a valid user. Similarly, in March 2024, 
ransomware threat actor Storm\-0501 attacked 
Azure environments using the AADInternals 
tool to federate attacker\-owned domains 
within compromised tenants, using the newly 
federated identity provider to sign into additional 
valid accounts. 

Storm\-0539, which primarily targets retail 
organizations for gift card fraud and theft, also has 
a deep understanding of cloud environments that it 
exploits to conduct reconnaissance on organizations’ 
gift card issuance processes and employee access. 
The actor then conducts phishing attacks to hijack 
cloud accounts. After gaining access to a user’s 
session and token, Storm\-0539 registers its own 
malicious devices so that multifactor authentication 
(MFA) prompts associated with a compromised 
victim account go to the threat actor’s device. 
Registering a device lets them wholly compromise 
an identity and persist in the cloud environment.

1 Centralize your organization’s identity

2 Require all users to enroll in MFA. MFA can 
inherently stop an attack before it even 
begins by preventing an attacker who 
has managed to compromise a user’s 
credentials from accessing network 
resources. Require phishing\-resistant 
authentication for all developers and all 
users in administrative roles. 

3 Block legacy authentication. Apps using 

their own legacy methods to authenticate 
and access company data pose another risk 
for organizations. The alternative, modern 
authentication, reduces security risk by 
supporting MFA and Conditional Access. 

4 Understand your cloud environment’s 
“trust chain.” With the rise of SaaS 
applications, guest accounts, and delegated 
privileges, an organization might fail to 
properly determine who has access to what 
within their cloud tenant. Attackers use this 
ambiguity to identify identities that already 
have access to resources of interest. 

5 Create a custom activity policy to get alerts 

about suspicious usage patterns.

Cyber Point of View: Canada 

How Canada is boosting security by 
investing in innovation and partnerships 

Housed within the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 
the National Cybercrime Coordination Centre (NC3\) 
performs a key role when it comes to Canada’s 
global contribution to reduce cybercrime. 

The NC3 has not only established operational 
links with domestic policing but allowed Canada 
to join international efforts in joint\-sequenced 
operations that attack the enabling pillars of 
global cybercriminality. These efforts have 
included Canadian law enforcement working 
alongside law enforcement from 10 countries 
as part of “Operation Cronos” to systematically 
disrupt and discredit LockBit’s business model and 
expose affiliates associated with this notorious 
ransomware gang. 

NC3 has also been active in warning businesses 
and organizations about impending cyberattacks. 
It warns 300\-400 victims per year and facilitates the 
deployment of decryption tools where available so 
victims can regain access to their data or systems. 
The NC3 also enhances the capabilities of Canada’s 
law enforcement agencies through technical, 
intelligence and case coordination support. 

Microsoft further integrates the Cyber Centre’s 
Aventail feed into its own threat intelligence 
ecosystem contributing to improved cyber threat 
detections for customers worldwide. Microsoft’s 
security engineering teams extensively utilize the 
Cyber Centre’s assembly line malware detection 
and analysis tool within our cloud based cyber 
defense systems.

Identity and social engineering DDoS attacks

DDoS: Stealthier 
threats emerge 

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) 
attacks are cyberattacks that aim to 
disrupt or disable a website or online 
service by overwhelming it with traffic 
from multiple sources. DDoS attacks can 
cause significant losses for businesses 
such as downtime, lost revenue, 
damaged reputation, and increased costs. 

The loop attack is a stark reminder of the 
vulnerabilities that exist within our network 
protocols. It highlights the need for continuous 
vigilance and the development of robust 
security measures to protect against such 
sophisticated threats. 

Application layer attacks are 
more stealthy, sophisticated, 
and difficult to mitigate than 
network\-level attacks.

Attack landscape 

Beginning in mid\-March, we observed a rise in 
network DDoS attacks, reaching approximately 
4,500 attacks per day in June. Additionally, there 
was a significant surge in attacks targeting medium 
size applications. Application layer attacks are more 
stealthy, sophisticated, and difficult to mitigate than 
network\-level attacks. 

These attacks, which are in the range of 100,000 to 
1 million packets\-per\-second, are aimed directly at 
specific web applications, revealing the relentless 
nature of attackers trying to evade volumetric 
DDoS protection tactics. Without adequate 
protection, these applications would experience 
availability issues. 

The increased focus of DDoS attacks on the 
application layer rather than the more traditional 
network layers has created a greater risk of impact 
on business availability, such as access to online 
banking services or the ability to check\-in for 
airline flights. 

A new threat: 
Application loop attacks 

A new type of cyberattack is targeting the very 
protocols that form the backbone of our internet 
communication. Dubbed the “loop attack,” 
this vulnerability reveals a critical weakness in 
application\-layer protocols that rely on the User 
Datagram Protocol (UDP). According to the 
Helmholtz Center for Information Security (CISPA), 
these attacks could potentially affect 300,000 
application servers worldwide. The loop attack 
does not discriminate in its choice of targets. 
Protocols that many consider the lifeblood of the 
internet—such as TFTP, DNS, and NTP—are at risk, 
along with legacy protocols like Echo, Chargen, and 
QOTD. The vulnerability triggers an endless loop of 
error messages between servers, leading to a severe 
degradation of service and network quality. 

Unlike the more commonly known reflected 
UDP\-based floods, loop attacks may not amplify 
the traffic volume with each spoofed packet. 
However, they can still cause significant disruption 
by ensnaring multiple servers in a never\-ending 
communication loop. This is initiated by a single, 
well\-crafted packet, and once the loop starts, there’s 
no stopping it, and the network flood that ensues 
can threaten not just the application servers but also 
the underlying network infrastructure.

network layer DDoS protection in place. 
Specific to web applications, it’s important 
to protect them with a web application 
firewall that provides comprehensive 
application layer protection.

Cyber Point of View: India 

DDoS attacks on the rise in India 

India was one of the countries most affected by 
DDoS in 2024, continuing the trend from last 
year. In 2023, it ranked third in the number of 
DDoS attacks per customer organization in the 
APAC region and ninth in the world, with the 
finance, technology, and government sectors the 
most targeted. 

The number of DDoS attacks per customer in India 
has more than doubled since 2020\.35 Most of the 
DDoS attacks in the APAC region from February 
to June 2024 targeted India, especially the gaming 
sector. Online gaming is prone to DDoS attacks, 
and it is a growing sector in India. The mid\-size 
throughput attacks reached \~1,000 attacks per 
day on India’s gaming sector alone, accounting 
for \~20% of all attacks. The attack volume per 
customer during that time also increased from 1\.4 
Gbps to 2\.4 Gbps.

Separately, DNS query floods are the most common 
type of application\-level DDoS attacks in India. 
Hacktivists, who use cyberattacks to express 
their political, social, or ideological views, are a 
major source of DDoS attacks, and cloud\-based 
resources are increasingly used by both attackers 
and defenders. Microsoft found a spike in DDoS 
activity in India in June of 2024\. This is unsurprising 
given there has historically been an increase in 
cyberattacks during election periods, and India’s 
national elections occurred from April to June. 

DDoS attacks in India January–June 2024: 

▪ Maximum number of vectors seen in a single 

attack: 9\. 

▪ Maximum attack throughput: 61 Gbps and 

41\.2 Mpps. 

▪ Top attack vectors: TCP ACK flood, SSDP

Introduction: Tackling technical debt 
and shadow IT for a secure future 

Threat actors prey on unaddressed 
technical debt, outdated security controls, 
and shadow IT. 

If there is a weak point in your system, threat actors 
are going to find it. You may be using the latest 
security tools to fortify your core environment, but if 
you still have old infrastructure, unpatched systems, 
outdated configurations, and apps granted too many 
permissions by departments you aren’t even aware 
of, then you may be unwittingly leaving security 
holes for threat actors to exploit. 

Leaving these issues unaddressed is like installing a 
vault with an impenetrable lock, then forgetting the 
vent that leads to the roof. Or, forgetting about the 
drain to the sewer or the unfortified wall adjacent to 
the parking lot. The burglar won’t be discouraged 
by the lock—they’ll just find one of the alternate 
pathways you have left for them. 

When it comes to digital security, it doesn’t matter 
how locked\-down your user policies are: if an 
adversary can gain entry via a long\-forgotten 
avenue, they will. 

Whether it is a test app from an untracked 
satellite tenant that doesn’t enforce multifactor 
authentication (MFA), devices infected with malware, 
or legacy authentication protocols, security teams 
can’t act on resources they simply don’t know about. 
These include: 

▪ Unsanctioned, unmonitored or abandoned 

tenants built ad hoc for development, testing, 
or demos. 

▪ Applications and workload identities with no 

known owner or governance. 

▪ Developer secrets checked into public 

code repositories. 

▪ Storage repositories with inadequate 

access controls. 

Clearing out technical debt 

As part of our Secure Future Initiative (SFI), Microsoft 
embarked on rigorous “spring cleaning” to 
strengthen our environment and cloud services 
against threats. We removed millions of unused 
and non\-compliant applications and tenants from 
our environment, refreshed hundreds of thousands 
of credentials (including security certificates), and 
segmented and isolated our network. 

SFI is a multiyear initiative to evolve the way we 
design, build, test, and operate our products and 
services so we can achieve the highest possible 
standards for security. 

We are taking proactive steps to keep security 
deficits from re\-accumulating: 

▪ Maintaining a comprehensive inventory of all 
production software and hardware assets. 

▪ Enforcing a standard approach for creating 

secure test tenants with zero trust principles, 
automatically deleting them after use to avoid 
legacy infrastructure buildup. 

▪ 

Increasing isolation of development and test 
environments to prevent lateral movement 
into production. 

▪ Enforcing the use of standard libraries and 
advanced code security checks for all apps 
and services. 

▪ Automatically scanning all internal productivity 

systems to remove passwords, secrets, and keys 
that attackers could exploit. 

▪ 

Improving logging capabilities to detect, 
investigate, and mitigate vulnerabilities faster, and 
share insights with customers sooner. 

In all cases, we’re creating “paved paths” for 
engineers, so that the easiest way to do something 
is the also right way. We continuously apply lessons 
from security incidents to improve our methods. 
In response to rising phishing and social engineering 
attacks, for example, we’re issuing phishing\-resistant 
credentials like passkeys to all employees. We also 
introduced video\-based user verification for lost 
credentials and automated processes for deploying 
security keys and storing secrets. Our platforms 
operate at the highest industry standards, and 
we’re building systems to maintain these levels as 
standards evolve. 

The Secure Future Initiative is not a destination, but 
an ongoing commitment to a security\-first culture 
that proactively identifies and openly discusses risks, 
issues, and blockers; quickly learns and iterates; 
and standardizes tools, dashboards, practices, and 
principles across all engineering teams. As with every 
feature and experience we ship, we’ll share with 
customers what we do, how they benefit, and how 
they can better protect themselves.

Strategic approaches to cybersecurity: 
“Managing your own house” 

Data security 

Accountability is increasingly central to the world 
of data security. From security strategies to new 
policies governing generative AI, organizations must 
start taking responsibility for what is going on under 
their own digital roof. 

Key components of an effective data 
security strategy 

In our experience, the most successful data security 
implementation strategies consider the following: 
visibility, risk detection, classification, labeling, data 
protection, and data leakage prevention across your 
multi\-cloud and hybrid digital estate. 

It is no longer enough to focus solely on the data; 
it’s just as important to understand how that data 

moves within the organization, how users, customers 
or partners interact with it, and what level of risk is 
acceptable for the organization. 

Data doesn’t move on its own. It’s moved by people. 
Because different people require different levels 
of access, a comprehensive data security policy 
must be dynamic, considering both data and user 
context. This lets organizations balance protection 
and productivity, allowing low\-risk users to continue 
working as usual while restricting the actions of 
users with elevated risk. 

As data types proliferate, sources get more complex, 
and generative AI technology gains traction, data 
security is inevitably becoming a pressing concern. 
A 2023 Microsoft study found that over 40% of enterprise 
(\>500 employees) organizations’ annual cybersecurity 
budget on average is now allocated to data security. 

An integrated approach to data security 

Classify and label sensitive data, and prevent its 
unauthorized use across apps, services, and devices. 

Information 
protection

Understand the user intent and context around the 
use of sensitive data to identify the most critical risks 

Data loss 
prevention

A DA P T I V E 
P R O T E C T I O N

Insider risk 
management

Assign high\-risk users to appropriate DLP, data 
lifecycle, and Conditional Access policies 

Securing organizational data has also become 
a multifaceted task, leading to the adoption of 
multiple, hard\-to\-manage tools. This kind of 
fragmented approach creates more noise from 
duplicated alerts, making it harder to identify and 
investigate actual incidents. Organizations using 
over 15 tools experienced nearly three times more 
data security incidents than organizations using 
fewer tools. This is why it is so important to invest 
in integrated, automated data security solutions to 
achieve the best outcomes. 

How generative AI is fueling the need for 
data security policy implementation 

Microsoft’s AI products, such as Copilot, are 
designed to use only information you already 
have access to. When other generative AI apps are 
deployed on ungoverned data estates it can result 
in data oversharing or leakage as users may end 
up accessing sensitive data. It is difficult to protect 
data from AI\-related security risks given many 
organizations don’t actually know where—or even 
what—their sensitive data is. 

Studies show 83% of organizations experience 
multiple data breaches over time, so getting ahead 
of the risks is critical. Data environments must be 
prepared for AI, which requires inventorying data 

stores, identifying sensitive data, then labeling and 
protecting it to ground the data and prevent its 
unintended exposure to AI apps. 

Applying data loss prevention policies for inputs 
and outputs from AI apps helps to prevent both 
overexposure and leakage for new AI generated 
data, while automating data classification and 
labeling vastly reduces the risk of data exposure. 
In summary, data loss prevention policies can apply 
to data that AI models consume and generate.

Harnessing generative AI to define your 
data perimeter 

AI can be a powerful tool for data exploration, and 
customers and partners worldwide are increasingly 
using it to improve their data management 
practices. For example, data security teams are 
using AI to refine their data loss prevention 
policies, classification labeling practices, and 
encryption usage. 

While innovative AI applications like Copilot offer 
exciting possibilities, it is crucial for organizations 
to first understand their data perimeters. By doing 
so, they can implement effective governance 
controls and data loss prevention policies to prevent 
overexposure and loss. Proactive measures must also 
be taken to safeguard infrastructure, devices, and 
containers against data\-targeted attacks. 

The rise of generative AI 
applications poses a serious 
threat to organizations that 
haven’t implemented sufficient 
data governance controls. 

To expedite this process in the realm of cloud 
computing, generative AI applications can be used 
to suggest improvements to data loss prevention 
policies. Our latest findings indicate that these 
applications can provide a quick and strategic 
approach, particularly for engaging and convincing 
policy users and creators who may be initially 
resistant. Moreover, when there is a need to discover 
the data estate, the computational capacity of 
generative AI can handle vast amounts of data, 
allowing for efficient governance. 

Compliance managers have been able to discern 
the sensitive, unprotected data from other data, 
and gain valuable time to approach the next steps. 
An example of an interaction with a generative 
AI assistant would be: “Show me the unprotected 
documents with sensitive information types in this 
SharePoint site I can access” and the AI assistant 
would generate a successful eDiscovery query.

The key learnings of this event were: 

▪ 

It is crucial to have advanced detection 
capabilities for identifying and mitigating 
data exfiltration with 24/7 active monitoring. 
Without this, the impact would have been 
much greater. 

▪ The time window for patching critical 

vulnerabilities has narrowed, from 14–30 days 
five years ago to a mere 24–72 hours today. 
This is in part because software vulnerabilities 
have become more prevalent as initial 
access vectors. 

▪ 

It is important to have ongoing business 
continuity planning that includes cyber threats 
in order to minimize the disruption and 
inconvenience caused by such attacks.

Cyber Point of View: Sweden 

Using the cloud to protect 
against ransom attacks 

In November 2023 the Church of Sweden, a 
religious institution with over 5\.4 million members 
and 3,400 churches, was targeted by Russian 
ransomware\-as\-a\-service operator Blackcat. 

Despite detecting the threat and acting quickly, 
data was exfiltrated and a significant number of 
systems encrypted before the threat was isolated. 
It took over two months to recover, impacting the 
Church’s ability to raise funds during the critical 
Christmas period and to perform some services, 
such as funerals. 

Since the Church’s cloud services remained in\-
service, the Church was able to maintain its internal 
and external communication through M365, which 
was a key factor for maintaining effective crisis 
communication throughout the crisis. 

As has become common in recent years, not only 
were the Church’s systems encrypted and data 
exfiltrated, but the Church then faced an extortion 
threat if it did not pay to prevent that data from 
being published. Ultimately, a second threat actor, 
Lockbit, published 2\.3 million files after the Church 
refused to pay.

The Silo Effect 

Thinking differently to address threats 

Most organizations rate bugs according to 
severity and how difficult they are to mitigate 
before assigning a team to fix them within a set 
compliance window. However, what happens is 
clashing prioritizations and silos with no knowledge 
of an adversary’s attack path. Hence the saying: 
“Defenders think in lists and attackers think 
in graphs”. 

Organizations have complex operating environments 
that require defenders to see across various vendors 
in order to discover attack paths. Instead, they 
should look to understand their critical assets and 
crucially how they are, or could be, connected. 
The resulting view of an organization’s posture is 
key to understanding the risk exposure to cyber 
threats. By adopting an attacker’s perspective, the 
prioritization of mitigation efforts is enhanced. 

Defenders must adapt 
to attacker’s mindset.

Critical asset management 

Traditionally, organizations have leaned on all sorts 
of different security tools to manage threat exposure 
across their estate. This messy patchwork of 
approaches however, can lead to exposure visibility 
gaps and efficiency challenges. 

This makes it imperative for security leaders to reach 
a unified and comprehensive view of their estate and 
to both continuously and smartly prioritize exposure 
reduction efforts. Prioritization should seek to 
understand threats and attacker perspective, identify 
“crown jewels” of interest to the attacker, and both 
identify and mitigate any paths that lead to them. 

Three key components are required for threat\-
informed defense: single pane of glass, critical asset 
protection, and attack path management. 

Single pane of glass 

Organizations should consolidate threat exposure 
insights across their estate into a single view 
covering cloud assets, on\-prem devices, data, 
identities, applications, network, and the Internet of 
Things (IOT). This should then be used to manage 
top threats such as ransomware and business 
email compromise, as well as exposure to threat 
campaigns and actors. 

80% 

of organizations have attack 
paths that expose critical assets

It is imperative to thoroughly map an estate’s 
“crown jewels.” This can include critical servers, 
highly privileged identities, sensitive data, or other 
assets. Microsoft data indicates that an average 
\<1% of organizational assets are of high interest 
to attackers. 

Attack path management 

Organizations should identify the most likely attack 
paths leading to critical assets and continuously 
mitigate them. An attack path calculation 
incorporates things such as asset inventories, 
vulnerability/weakness data, and external attack 
surfaces to construct a possible attack chain leading 
to a critical asset.

Introduction

Strategic cybersecurity 

Supporting the ecosystem

Collective action

Optimizing governance 
and accountability 

When viewed as a business risk, cybersecurity is 
everyone’s responsibility. As senior managers wrestle 
with how to set up their organization’s governance, 
the need for a more responsible approach to 
operating models quickly emerges, particularly 
when it comes to defining security responsibilities 
for roles that sit outside the scope of the security 
team. These tasks are further complicated by how 
dynamic and rapidly changing the threats that 
cyber challenges post to technology platforms and 
transforming business models. 

To manage this, organizations should adopt 
comprehensive, clear, and adaptable operating 
models. Their culture and governance structure 
must make it clear that security is everyone’s role, 
providing clear guidelines, and building in flexibility 
to accommodate changes in the threat landscape. 
Cybersecurity incidents are like forest fires: they can 
start anywhere and spread anywhere within minutes. 
Organizations should focus their security culture and 
governance efforts on accountability, teamwork, and 
shared responsibility. 

Accountability always starts at the top, with 
organizational leaders who not only understand 
their responsibility for security outcomes but 
ensure that security risk management is embedded 
across their business in an organization\-wide and 
collaborative way. 

Leaders must establish a system of accountability, 
prioritization, and aligned incentives that is 
executed and monitored across the organization. 
They must delegate risk accountability, mitigation 
implementation responsibility, and associated 
budgets/costs to leaders, managers, and individual 
contributors, as accountability alone cannot create 
a healthy culture. Unfunded mandates or the 
belief that “security is the security team’s job” will 
result in avoidable security weaknesses, increased 
burnout of security resources, and, in time, greater 
organizational cost. 

Leaders must support mechanisms that incorporate 
security into business unit KPIs/scorecards, inclusion 
of security in enterprise business discussions among 
executives and boards of directors, and security 
education for all roles. They must also evaluate the 
systems of financial incentives in place, including 
those at the senior level to ensure good security 
behavior is prioritized and rewarded. They must also 
publicly promote the idea that security is important, 
and demonstrate that everyone is expected to 
collaborate to solve security problems. 

Establishing cross\-team processes and goals is 
crucial, as many people have never even worked 
with other teams on security issues and very often 
don’t know who to work with in the first place. 
Shared goals must be reflected in performance 
metrics for executives, teams, and individuals 
throughout the organization. 

Key elements should include: 

Avoiding blame. 

Tips to build security literacy: 

Make it personal and human. 

Unless there is a clear violation of professionalism 
or failure of due diligence, avoid assigning blame 
for security incidents. Blame invariably increases risk 
by poisoning a culture with fear and undermining 
the collaboration required for an effective 
coordinated defense. 

Making sure learnings or issues don’t slip 
through the cracks. 

Security issues are often discovered through critical 
thinking, fresh perspectives, and unexpected 
sources. Establish ways to capture inputs and 
feedback regardless of where they are found (“See 
something, say something” adage). 

Sharing responsibility. 

Organizational leaders must normalize security as 
part of everyone’s job. Everyone in the organization, 
including board members, must have basic literacy 
of cybersecurity threats, a sense of personal 
responsibility for security, and clarity on their role 
in security. 

Requiring cross\-team training and learning. 

Fostering understanding, empathy, and repeatable 
cross\-team processes enables teams to work well 
together on security. This typically requires ongoing 
focus, reinforcement, and practice to overcome 
past habits. 

Build training tailored to your organization and 
roles (so people can apply it easily and quickly). 
Relate stories about how attacks could happen in 
real life, and teach people to use safe cybersecurity 
practices at home and at work. 

Make it clear. 

Always ensure people understand why it’s important, 
what they need to do, and how to do it through 
policy and education. 

Make it engaging and fun. 

Use gamification, interactive hands\-on components, 
positive reinforcement, and/or public recognition to 
keep people engaged. 

Make it easy. 

Most people prefer to take the easy path in all 
things, so ensure the security behaviors you want to 
drive are simple and straightforward. 

Organizations should focus their 
security culture and governance 
efforts on accountability, teamwork, 
and shared responsibility.

Communication 

Execution 

Microsoft’s Incident Response (IR) team are the First Responders of the cybersecurity space. 

Similar to how police, fire or, paramedics are called to the scene of an accident, the IR team must quickly 
assess the situation, devise a plan, and take immediate action. And just like how society has come to 
depend on the lessons First Responders have gleaned over decades of service, the real\-world experience 
of our IR teams can be used as a template for organizations to better prepare for cyber incidents. 

In particular, we highlight three categories: preparation, communication, and execution. 

Ever wondered why First Responders are able to 
control an emergency so quickly and confidently? 

 Preparation 

1 Preparation 

2 Established playbooks 

Too often, IR teams find their customers don’t 
have a reporting plan in place. This means it takes 
precious time to understand the needs of each 
individual stakeholder and establish the necessary 
line of reporting. 

It is crucial to have a well\-prepared response plan 
in place before an incident, as scrambling for key 
information during an incident can be chaotic. 
This means identifying key decision makers, 
business\-critical applications and services, roles 
and responsibilities, and response and recovery 
processes well in advance. Not having this 
information at hand leads to longer recovery times 
and higher impacts on the business. 

Without accurate information and established 
communication lines, key data may be lost or poorly 
relayed during a security incident. A company 
should therefore tailor its communication based 
on its audience, for example: company executives, 
regulatory bodies, employees, and the public. 

Each group requires different levels of technicality. 
Executives need brief, high\-level summaries that 
focus on the impact on business operations 
and steps being taken to resolve the issue. 
Regulatory bodies require detailed reports that 
comply with legal and industry\-specific regulations. 
Communication with the public is equally important 
and should provide transparent and reassuring 
messages that protect customers’ trust and address 
their concerns without revealing sensitive details. 

A similar approach should be taken for internal 
communication. Establishing a single source of 
truth for employees—an internal communications 
channel or newsletter—is important for reducing 
misinformation. In situations where established 
communication channels could be compromised, 
having an alternative communication channel 
is crucial. 

Communication does not end once the incident 
is resolved. Ongoing updates on the progress, 
root cause analysis, and preventative measures 
are vital. Providing regular post\-incident 
communication that includes lessons learned 
and actions taken to prevent future incidents 
demonstrates transparency, builds trust, and shows 
the organization’s commitment to security and 
continuous improvement. 

 Execution 

In terms of technical preparation, execution 
encompasses all aspects for which a company 
can plan. 

Established playbooks not only consist of procedural 
plans to contain, recover, or remediate risks, but 
also include actionable steps to address these 
tasks. Common examples include: containment and 
recovery of identity systems which may require a 
mass password reset. 

Other containment actions need to be taken into 
account. What measures, technologies, tools, or 
practices should be followed in the event of a 
compromise on multiple client systems? Although 
a company may have excellent security tools in 
place, their effectiveness is diminished if the team 
responsible for managing them lacks proper training.

Introduction

Strategic cybersecurity 

Supporting the ecosystem

Collective action

Additionally, recovery actions (such as recovering 
data rendered inaccessible by the threat actor) can 
be beneficial. Organizations do not always have the 
chance to practice these actions and this lack of 
familiarity with recovery practices can significantly 
impede attempts to restore the environment in a 
timely manner during incidents. A mature playbook 
process can be compared to fire drills at a work site. 
Many companies regularly test their preparedness 
for a fire emergency, but only a limited number 
do the same with cybersecurity. This reinforces 
the importance of preparation, including creating 
tabletop exercises and conducting drills to validate 
their effectiveness. 

The following are the most common challenges 
we encountered during IR engagements: 

Reporting lines are not clearly defined 

▪ Reporting lines are needed to make the right 

decisions and keep everyone informed of current 
ongoing tasks, investigation and recovery 
progress, and business impact. 

Roles and responsibilities are not clearly defined 

▪ Having unclear definitions of roles and 

responsibilities can hinder the effective and timely 
response to security incidents. The speed of 
recovery necessitates prompt decision\-making. 

▪ Business decision makers have a crucial 

role in defining business\-critical services, 
making investment decisions, and setting 
company strategy. 

▪ Technical decision makers and operations 

personnel are also crucial during incidents as 
they possess deep knowledge of dependencies. 

▪ To navigate the legal aspects and maintain 
compliance, a legal team (internal and/or 
external) is critical especially when incidents 
involve sensitive data, such as personally 
identifiable information (PII). 

Lack of preparedness simulation exercises 

▪ To prepare for incidents, nothing is more effective 

than conducting mock or tabletop exercises. 

▪ These exercises equip individuals with the skills 
and knowledge to handle real incidents and 
provide valuable insights about areas in need 
of improvement. 

Cyber Point of View: Latin America 

Following the simulation, Microsoft facilitated 
dialogue and knowledge exchange among 
the participants, underscoring the power of 
collaboration in addressing cybersecurity 
challenges. This exercise showed how experiential 
learning and collective engagement can enhance 
board members’ understanding of cybersecurity 
and strengthen an organization’s resilience. 

Tough lessons for board members 
about cybersecurity 

Microsoft recently launched an initiative that 
brought together unions like the Instituto de 
Directores de Chile, IDirectores, Icare, and Women 
Corporate Directors and board members from 
over 150 companies in Mexico, Chile, Colombia, 
and Peru. 

The initiative simulated a cyberattack on a retail 
company during the peak of Cyber Monday, 
to serve as both a crisis management test and 
an opportunity for learning and collaboration. 
It was executed without alerting the participants 
beforehand and began with a phishing email 
sent to an employee, and the board members’ 
responses provided valuable insights into 
organizational preparedness and areas 
for improvement.

Resilience maturity 

Within the dynamic realm of cybersecurity, the IR team regularly confronts a wide spectrum of customer challenges. Drawing from this rich 
experience, we have found that an organization’s resilience maturity can be determined based on four pillars: Operational, Tactical, Readiness, 
and Strategic. Maturity in each of these pillars is categorized as either Basic, Moderate, or Advanced.

Operational 

Tactical 

For day\-to\-day IT operations, good preparation and maturity can ensure that an organization has 
good visibility of its estate, documented reliable playbooks, and rapid response capabilities based 
on automation. 
▪ Deploy an endpoint detection and response solution on all desktops and servers, with a dedicated 

security operations team whose primary role is monitoring and actioning alerts.

▪ Automation within an existing SIEM / SOAR solution.
▪ Test, tune, and actively manage custom playbooks and adjust them to specific needs. 
▪

Implement a multi\-tier security operations center (SOC), where common alerts are automatically 
triaged. Establish a feedback loop to improve playbooks and adjust environment hardening.

Prepare for initial response to an incident to respond logically and efficiently. 

▪ Maintain detailed and practiced IR plans with clear actions to be taken in the event of an incident.
▪ Provide IR and threat\-hunting teams with a clearly defined scope for proactive security hardening 

duties. Enforce strong phishing resistant MFA for all user accounts.

▪ Establish a ready, out\-of\-band communication channel in case there is a severe infrastructure 

compromise. This helps to ensure timely and secure communication with dedicated update meetings 
to keep all participants informed.
Implement firewall and endpoint containment capabilities. Set up mass password reset capabilities 
and automatic attack disruption mechanisms.

▪

Readiness 

Strategic 

Prepare for a cybersecurity incident. 
▪ Require employees to complete training and demonstrate understanding of material before granting 

Take steps to improve overall security posture in the longer term. 
▪ Actively managed software and technology, with planned migration and modernization projects to 

continued access to company resources and data.

Implement service level agreements for recovery time and recovery point objectives.

▪ Conduct continuous access reviews for company resources and data.
▪
▪ Maintain up\-to\-date infrastructure diagrams and documentation across entire environment.
▪ Compare changes against an existing desired state before implementing them. Regularly update 
documentation to reflect these changes. Maintain detailed asset management, including location, 
owner, and automatic device discovery, and with device compliance.

▪ Enforce strict compliance policies to ensure only compliant devices have access to company resources.
▪ Conduct tabletop exercises on a regular basis. Track and implement feedback and conclusions.

keep infrastructure up to date. Proactively implement new technologies.

▪ Conduct proactive and automatic vulnerability scans on a scheduled basis, for impact analysis on newly 
published vulnerabilities. Track and follow up on mitigations. Ensure scheduled maintenance windows.
▪ Clearly define access and authorization strategy to implement zero trust principles. Clearly define and 

enforce just\-in\-time (JIT) and just\-enough administration (JEA).

▪ Use passwordless authentication for all identities, privileged or otherwise.
▪

Implement zero trust strategy with a clear desired future state, including continuous evaluation, 
improvement and defined timelines.

The passkey journey: 
a story of collaboration 
across the industry 

Passkeys perform a simple function. They offer users 
faster, easier, and most critically, more secure sign\-
ins to websites and apps across their devices than 
password\-based methods.36 

Instead of vulnerable secrets or potentially 
identifiable personal information, a passkey uses 
a private key stored safely on the user’s device. 
It only works on the website or app for which the 
user created it, and if that same user unlocks it with 
their biometrics or PIN. This means passkey users 
can’t be tricked into signing in to a malicious look\-
alike website, and are unusable unless the user is 
present and consenting. These are some qualities 
that make passkeys a “phishing\-resistant” form 
of authentication. 

Passkeys are not only more secure than passwords, 
but also are easier to use and manage. Signing in 
requires a simple unlock gesture: looking into the 
device camera, pressing a finger to a fingerprint 
reader, or entering a PIN. Neither biometric 
information nor the local PIN ever leaves the 

device and are never shared with a site or service. 
Some passkeys sync between devices, meaning 
users can recover them if they lose or upgrade 
their device. Others are bound to the device. 
And last but not least, passkeys are much more 
convenient for users as people no longer have to 
worry about creating, remembering, resetting, or 
losing passwords. Passkeys can be stored in a variety 
of industry solutions including Windows Hello, 
hardware security keys, mobile devices, and third\-
party credential managers. 

Industry\-wide efforts to eliminate passwords 
in favor of phishing\-resistant authentication 
are gaining traction. Passkeys represent the 
most significant collaborative effort thus far. 
Adoption has accelerated after operating system 
providers and password managers made it easy 
to issue passkeys and bind them to hardware. 
Members of the FIDO Alliance37 and the World 
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) worked together on 
the standards. They include vendors who create 
browsers, operating systems, and hardware security 
keys, as well as banks, hardware platform providers, 
major retailers, and government bodies. All major 
operating systems, browsers, and mobile platforms 
now support passkeys. 

Instead of vulnerable secrets or potentially 
identifiable personal information, a passkey 
uses a private key stored safely on the 
user’s device. 

Platform support for creating and managing 
passkeys is the first step towards mass adoption. 
According to the FIDO Alliance, more than 140 major 
websites had added support for passkey sign\-in as 
of June 30, 2024, including Amazon, Best Buy, CVS 
Specialty, eBay, Home Depot, Instacart, Lowe’s, 
PayPal, PlayStation, Shopify, Sirius XM, Stripe, Target, 
Uber, WhatsApp, X, and Yahoo, plus services from 
Apple, Google, and Microsoft. Public sector support 
for the FIDO2 standard is gaining momentum and 
national agencies in at least six countries as well as 
some US state and local governments are now using 
FIDO2 technology. 

As industry support for passkeys grows, general 
awareness will increase as a natural consequence. 
Makers of operating systems, platforms, and 
credential managers, as well as relying parties 
such as providers of consumer\-facing websites, are 
working with the standards bodies to make the 
passkey experience even easier and more secure. 
In the meantime, the message for anyone concerned 
about cyber security is clear: passkeys are better 
than passwords and most forms of legacy MFA. 

Actionable Insights 

1 Consumers: look for the passkey logo to 
identify websites or services that support 
passkeys. Create and use passkeys 
wherever possible. 

2 Security professionals: give vendors 
feedback to help shape the future of 
passkeys. Ask whether they support 
passkeys and explore whether their 
implementation supports your use cases. 

3 Software developers: visit the FIDO 

Alliance website for resources on how to 
add passkey support to your website, app, 
or service.

Cyber Point of View: France 

Enhancing France’s 
cybersecurity workforce 

France is grappling with a deficit of 60,000 
cybersecurity experts, a part of the broader 
European shortfall of 300,000 professionals. In the 
face of this acute shortage, the local Microsoft 
cybersecurity team developed the “Cybersecurity, 
My Future Job!” pedagogical kit. 

The kit is part of a wider cybersecurity skills 
training plan launched in 2022 and was created 
using existing local content from ANSSI, CNIL, 
and Cybermalveillance.gouv.fr, all of which are 
French organizations dedicated to cybersecurity 
and privacy. 

It is designed to help young people (15 to 21 
years old) better understand cybersecurity issues 
and discover associated professions. It features 
independent modules that can be completed 
in a one\-hour session or extended to a half\-day 
workshop and two guides: one for participants and 
one for facilitators. 

The kit is available in French and English and 
can easily be translated into different languages 
and tailored to specific countries. Its flexible and 
adaptive nature, coupled with its open\-source 
availability on GitHub, allows for continuous 
updates and customizations. This makes an 
excellent resource to attract interest in the 
cybersecurity field. Since its pilot in May 2022, the 
kit has been used not only with students, but also 
in corporate training settings as well.

Critical environments 

Our previous Microsoft Digital Defense Reports have 
shown that while IT hardware and software security 
has strengthened, the security of IoT and operational 
technology (OT) devices has not kept pace. In this 
section we offer security stories from the critical 
infrastructure frontline. 

At Microsoft, we manage a large and growing 
estate of OT devices essential to the operations of 
our global datacenters. The following section of 
the report details our experiences managing this 
infrastructure in two important aspects: building 
and operating a program for reviewing the security 
of third\-party OT applications, and managing the 
unique process of updating fleets of OT devices to 
address security vulnerabilities.

Security stories from the frontline of OT

Threat actors are now exploiting OT devices to do 
everything from accessing critical and operational 
networks, to enabling lateral movement, establishing 
a foothold in a supply chain, or disrupting the 
target’s OT operations.

A three\-step action plan: insights from 
testing OT applications 

Our global datacenters rely heavily on OT 
equipment, such as sensors and actuators. 
These devices are pivotal for managing critical 
processes including power management and cooling 
systems within our infrastructure. Recognizing the 
need to secure these foundational technologies, 
Microsoft has spearheaded a crucial initiative over 
the past four years aimed at fortifying the security of 
third\-party OT applications which are integral to not 
only our operations but also the wider ecosystem. 

Our targeted security program reviewed these 
third\-party OT applications to identify and address 
potential vulnerabilities, to help ensure their 
robustness and reliability. The initiative not only 
bolstered the security posture of our datacenters 
but significantly contributed to enhancing security 
standards across the OT industry. 

We shared the findings from our reviews with the 
respective vendors of the products evaluated, 
creating a collaborative environment for knowledge 
sharing and mutual improvement in OT application 
security. Raising the security bar in this way, the 
products are being made more secure for the whole 
industry. For instance, this collaborative approach 
has led to significant security enhancements in 
products such as power monitoring systems, which 
now integrate more securely with Windows Server 
Active Directory, marking a substantial improvement 
from non\-directory based accounts. 

Based on this work we’ve identified three core 
actions that, if taken by the operations technology 
industry, would significantly improve the security of 
systems across the industry:

▪ Electrical power monitoring systems: These 
systems monitor electrical power aspects such 
as frequency, voltage, and wattage. They are 
passive systems connected to power meters and 
circuits, focusing on monitoring and situational 
awareness of the health of all electrical systems

facing servers. 

▪ Battery monitoring systems: These continuously 
assess the health and performance of batteries 
under different load conditions to ensure 
datacenter availability by preventing battery 
backup failures. 

Types of OT systems in datacenters 

The OT infrastructure systems in datacenters 
are critical for maintaining operational integrity 
and safety, focusing on ensuring optimal 
environmental conditions and monitoring essential 
operational parameters: 

▪ 

Industrial control systems (ICS): Also referred 
to sometimes as OT, these systems monitor 
hardware to ensure everything runs at optimal 
levels. They include sensors and devices for 
managing power and environmental conditions 
within datacenters. 

▪ Building automation systems: These systems 
are focused on cooling systems, HVAC, water 
chillers, and other mechanisms for producing 
cold air. They are considered active systems with 
moving parts like fans, water chillers, and pumps. 

Building on this, the goal of any OT application 
security review program is to: 

▪ 

Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities. 
Identify security vulnerabilities within third\-
party OT applications, which are critical for the 
operation of datacenters. 

▪ Ensure operational integrity. Review and 
secure OT applications that manage critical 
infrastructure, such as the above\-mentioned 
systems. This is vital for maintaining the 
availability and reliability of services. 

▪ Offer compliance and risk management. 

Conducting security reviews helps in compliance 
with internal and external security standards 
and regulations. It also plays a significant role in 
risk management by proactively identifying and 
addressing security risks.

Emerging challenges and trends 

Looking ahead, we are seeing a number of trends that will increasingly impact OT security. 

Inherent risks of vulnerabilities 
in OT equipment 

▪ Health and safety: The exploitation of 

vulnerabilities in OT software can lead to 
significant health and safety risks. For example, 
if the cooling systems in datacenters are 
compromised, it could lead to overheating, 
posing a risk to both the equipment and 
individuals within the facility. 

▪ Service disruption: Vulnerabilities can lead to 

disruptions in datacenter operations, affecting the 
availability of services to customers.

ICS/OT solution providers, like all solution 
providers, aim to integrate and upgrade their 
existing solutions with modern cloud and 
AI/ML\-based solutions for industrial control 
processes. While these advancements are 
exciting, they also challenge the effectiveness 
of existing security controls and network 
isolation techniques for critical processes. 

▪ Data breach and loss: Security weaknesses could

▪ Reputational damage: Incidents resulting from 
unaddressed vulnerabilities can damage the 
service provider’s reputation, affecting customer 
trust and business continuity. 

▪ Compliance violations: Failure to secure 
OT equipment can result in violations of 
regulatory requirements, leading to legal and 
financial consequences. 

consumer and business technology products, 
and is increasingly appearing in OT products 
as well. These wireless capabilities must 
evolve to meet the needs of industrial 
control environments before they can be 
further adopted.

ICS/OT attack frameworks and toolkits that 
support OT devices and protocols used 
for critical industrial processes are being 
developed and used by malicious actors. 

4 Automated and AI enabled attack techniques 

create a sophisticated global attacker 
workforce that never sleeps and is always 
looking for vulnerabilities in security defenses. 

5 Securing ICS/OT systems is challenging 

because change is purposefully avoided to 
ensure the process always works and can 
have decades\-long lifecycles in production. 
These systems risk becoming collateral 
damage even when not directly targeted 
by attackers. 

As of July 2024, we had 
identified and shared over 
300 vulnerabilities in third\-party 
OT applications. The initiative 
contributed to significant 
improvements in security 
across the OT industry.

Categorizing the vulnerabilities 

As of July 2024, we had identified and disclosed 
over 300 vulnerabilities to suppliers through our 
OT application review initiative. This work offers a 
unique perspective on the types and risks of security 
weaknesses in OT equipment. 

The most common security vulnerabilities we 
identified, prioritized by risk and impact, are: 

▪ Outdated authentication: Vendors should 

adopt modern authentication methods, such 
as integrating Windows Server Active Directory 
for identity management, to enhance security 
through Kerberos security groups, password 
complexity, and rotation policies. 

▪ 

Insecure configurations: OT applications 
should be secure by default and not contain 
built\-in passwords or accounts that could pose a 
security risk. They should also comply with secure 
communication protocols like current versions 
of TLS. 

▪ Outdated legacy libraries: Vendors should 

update legacy software libraries, which are often 
outdated and contain numerous vulnerabilities. 
Updating, however, is a significant challenge due 
to the resources required for updates and the 
potential impact on application functionality.

Actionable Insights 

1 Consider adopting a formal application 
security review program for critical 
OT assets. 

2 Recognize the need to find a balance 

between timely deployment of security 
patches and maintaining availability. 

3 Leverage solutions that build inventories 
of OT assets, prioritize risks, and help to 
identify malicious network activities. 

The challenges of securing OT 
networking protocols 

The OT environment is unique place. It has 
special characteristics and legacies that have 
resulted in the use of insecure networking 
protocols. Addressing these challenges is 
essential for improving the security posture of OT 
environments and protecting critical infrastructure 
from emerging threats. For example, the lack of 
encryption for backend network traffic poses a 
risk if adversaries gain network access, including 
operational disruptions and potential sabotage. 
Other key challenges leading to insufficient security 
protocols include: 

1 Latency and Performance: Implementing security 
measures like encryption can introduce latency 
due to the need for additional processing, such as 
SSL handshakes (Secure Sockets Layer connection 
to establish an encrypted link between client and 
server to enable secure data transmission), which 
can impact real\-time operational requirements. 

2 Legacy Systems Compatibility: Many OT systems 
rely on older, inherently insecure protocols that 
lack modern security features. In some cases, 
the hardware is not powerful enough to run 
encrypted protocols. Upgrading these systems 
to support secure protocols can be challenging 
and costly. 

3 Certificate Management: Secure protocols 

often require managing digital certificates for 
authentication and encryption. This can be 
complex, especially for devices with limited 
computational resources or in environments with 
a large number of devices. 

4 Operational Priorities: In OT environments, 

the priority is often on maintaining availability 
and operational continuity. Security measures 
that could potentially disrupt operations may 
therefore be deprioritized. 

5 Resource Constraints: Developing and 

implementing secure protocols requires 
significant resources, including skilled personnel 
and financial investment. Organizations may 
struggle with allocating the necessary resources 
to enhance security. 

Network security of embedded devices 

While an application security program effectively 
secures customer\-owned managed devices, 
datacenters face challenges from unmanaged 
employee devices, vendor equipment, and IoT/ 
OT devices. 

These devices often fall outside of established 
security policies, presenting risks due to their 
diverse nature and the organization’s limited direct 
control and necessitating a different strategy to 
address them. 

For example, runtime OT monitoring is an 
essential solution that helps organizations keep 
a comprehensive inventory of devices (including 
all information on operating systems, firmware, 
vendors, and models), assess the potential risk 
exposure from these devices, and detect any signs 
of malicious activity in real\-time. 

Firmware analysis on embedded devices can also 
be used to automate the identification of potential 
security vulnerabilities in these devices and 
identify and prioritize which devices need to be 
patched when new vulnerabilities are discovered. 
The additional layer of network security can be 
achieved using a non\-intrusive tool (passive) and 
without any impact to the environments using a 
dedicated network sensor or utilizing agents running 
on the managed devices that can act as a data 
source to secure those unmanaged OT devices in 
the datacenter and without any deployment activity.

Managing software and firmware updates 
in the critical infrastructure environment 

Last year, we highlighted research that used 
customer telemetry to show that while OT security 
vendors were patching critical vulnerabilities, 
there was a significant delay between the patches 
becoming available and when they were deployed— 
in some cases, up to 10 years. 

In the following section, we explore the OT software 
update challenge by using our Azure datacenters 
as a case study: showing that increased software 
security only works when it’s actually deployed. 

A fundamental difference between traditional IT 
and OT is the need to prioritize systems availability. 
This is because the OT infrastructure is supporting 
critical services where disruptions and outages could 
have significant, even life\-threatening consequences. 
At its core therefore, managing the update process 
is a supply chain integrity issue: managing the 
equipment, core software, component origin and 
how they changed between updates. Any deviation 
from expected operations or incompatibility in an 
update can cause an outage, and this is difficult for 
vendors to manage. 

For example, we saw variations in firmware versions 
of a cooling system take out multiple datacenters. 
Contrast this with our fully cloud\-managed system 
where we control the entire supply chain and 
regularly update hundreds of thousands of devices 
in under two days without outages. We highlight 
this approach as a north star for addressing the OT 
update challenge, but recognize it is one that will 
take years to achieve. 

Difficulties in updating software 
in the OT environment 

Compared to traditional IT software, there are 
several key points to consider: 

▪ Availability is paramount: In datacenters, the 
primary function of OT systems is to ensure the 
continuous operation of critical infrastructure, 
such as power management and cooling systems. 
Any disruption in these systems could lead to 
significant operational issues, including potential 
downtime of services provided by the center. 

▪ Security as a component of availability: 

While availability takes precedence, security is 
not ignored. It is considered a component of 
availability, since security breaches can lead to 
service disruptions. Therefore, security measures 
are implemented in a way that they do not 
compromise the availability of the OT systems. 

▪ Updating software in production 

environments: This is not as simple as just 
installing an update: it involves extensive 
testing to ensure updates do not disrupt the 
operational functionality or introduce new 
vulnerabilities. Updates must be carefully planned 
and executed to avoid any disruption in service. 
This often means that security patches and 
updates may be delayed or scheduled during 
maintenance windows to minimize impact on 
availability. The challenge is to balance the need 
for security with the imperative of maintaining 
uninterrupted operations. 

▪ The “infinite loop” challenge: Teams that 

manage our datacenters face the “infinite loop” 
problem, where updating to a new version of 
software to address security vulnerabilities can 
introduce new vulnerabilities or dependencies, 
leading to a cycle of continuous updates. 
This creates a situation where organizations are 
always carrying some level of security debt, as 
new updates can potentially introduce new issues.

Managing the OT software supply chain 

OT applications and devices can be complex, with 
hardware components, operating systems, core 
software, and supporting libraries sourced from a 
wide variety of suppliers. 

For a clean, seamless software update, all these 
elements need to be controlled so that devices 
continue to operate as expected—if not, there is a 
risk of service interruptions and downtime. 

This end\-to\-end control of a device update is very 
difficult to achieve, and results in the “infinite loop” 
cycle described above, impacting both vendors and 
security teams. Vendors often suggest upgrading to 
the next version as a solution to vulnerabilities found 
in the current version, but this too can introduce new 
vulnerabilities. This cycle is challenging for security 
teams as it becomes very difficult to achieve a state 
of minimal vulnerabilities. 

Actionable Insights 

Based on our OT experiences with our 
datacenters, we recommend the following: 

1 Vendors should provide clear 

documentation on the changes each 
update brings, including any new 
vulnerabilities introduced. This transparency 
can help security teams make informed 
decisions about updates. 

2 Encouraging vendors to provide 

incremental updates that fix current 
issues without introducing significant new 
features can minimize the introduction of 
new vulnerabilities. 

3 Security teams should work closely with 
vendors to understand the impact of 
updates and prioritize fixing of critical 
vulnerabilities that do not introduce 
significant new issues. 

Datacenter outages caused by firmware version mismatch 

A recent real\-life datacenter outage provides 
a compelling case study on the challenges of 
software updates in the OT environment. 

In our datacenters, OT cooling management 
systems monitor the temperature, adjusting both 
fan speed and air flow to keep servers within an 
acceptable operating range. If they fail the server 
will overheat, and to prevent physical damage the 
servers will be shut down. 

In this particular case, a firmware update was deployed 
to these systems, but due to a bug the devices with 
the new firmware did not communicate properly 
with the devices running the previous version. 

This resulted in a “packet storm” on the network 
controlling these devices, with high volumes of 
messages being passed between the devices. 
As a result, the devices ran out of memory and 
restarted. As they came back online, the devices 
operated at a low fan speed. As a result, significant 
parts of the datacenter computer infrastructure 
experienced a spike in temperature and had to be 
shut down. 

This outage occurred across multiple centers. 
While the teams quickly identified and resolved 
the issue, it highlights how firmware updates 
implemented without significant testing can 
potentially cause unexpected outages.

We consistently see updates 
deployed at scale to the entire 
fleet of devices. Typically, 
hundreds of thousands of 
devices are updated within 
48 hours of deployment with 
no production outages or 
downtime issues reported. 

Experiences with fully\-managed 
device updates 

Our north star for OT software updates is one where 
all components in the software and device supply 
chain can be controlled to minimize unexpected 
changes in device behavior on update. 

A good example is our experience in managing 
updates for Azure Sphere, which combines 
hardware, OS, and a fully cloud\-managed 
application and security environment. This allows 
control and visibility over the end\-to\-end supply 
chain of the product. Achieving this requires a 
comprehensive test and development lifecycle 
process to ensure updates can be deployed to 
the entire fleet simultaneously, maintaining high 
standards of reliability and security. 

Approaches like this will not be applicable in 
every OT environment, and the costs on the 
vendor side are not insignificant. However, we 
do see this as a long\-term approach to address 
security vulnerabilities in the OT environment while 
maintaining the availability promises required to 
protect critical infrastructure. 

Key steps included: 

▪ Building verification tests: These tests, both 
hardware and emulated software, validate that 
the update compiles correctly and maintains the 
expected contract with applications. This ensures 
that updates do not break existing functionalities. 

▪ Strict contractual layer: Azure Sphere maintains 
a strict contractual layer guaranteeing application 
compatibility across OS updates. This means 
applications are assured to run independently 
of OS updates, allowing for predictable behavior 
post\-update. 

▪ Customer and Original Equipment 

Manufacturers (OEM) testing: Before an update 
is released to the retail environment it undergoes 
testing by customers and OEMs in a retail 
evaluation setting. This step allows for real\-world 
testing and validation, ensuring that updates do 
not introduce new issues. 

▪ Scheduled updates: The Azure Sphere 

platform allows for updates to be deferred, 
accommodating operational requirements. 
This flexibility ensures that updates do not 
disrupt critical operations. 

▪ Fleet management at scale: Azure Sphere 

supports fleet management capabilities, allowing 
for updates to be managed and deployed across 
devices at scale efficiently. This includes the ability 
to set configurations remotely and manage 
devices autonomously.

The digital transformation 
of defense and a call for 
partnership 

Hybrid warfare, cyberattacks, and foreign influence 
operations pose grave risks not just to IT systems, 
but to the stability, prosperity and national security 
of society itself. 

As cyber risks take on more real\-world consequences, 
digital technologies can be powerful tools to enhance 
our traditional defense capabilities. However, to 
make this a reality, we need a deeper partnership 
between industry and governments to implement 
the digital transformation of the defense sector. 

Technology and initiatives touching on AI and 
cybersecurity were front and center at the 
recent 75th summit of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO). Cloud computing, AI, and 
quantum computing all have a role in cybersecurity, 
but their impacts on our collective defense can only 
be maximized through joint action and collaboration 
in defense innovation. Initiatives like the NATO’s 
Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North 
Atlantic (DIANA) and the NATO Innovation Fund 
(NIF) exemplify the strength of these collaborations. 

Beyond NATO, Ukraine’s digital transformation of 
the defense sector has showcased the effectiveness 
of industry\-government collaboration and the use 
of commercially available technologies in real\-world 
security situations. Microsoft believes that structures 
like NATO can complement national efforts in 
advancing the digital transformation of defense, 
as they help to maintain a broad perspective on 
standardization and interoperability efforts and 
ensure scale across an alliance.

How Microsoft helps 
support democratic 
elections 

During this unprecedented period of critical 
elections taking place around the world, Microsoft 
has worked to defend democratic institutions by 
combatting malicious schemes designed to disrupt 
or influence electoral processes and promoting a 
healthy information ecosystem. Our initiatives stem 
from four key principles: 

1 Voters have a right to transparent and 

authoritative information regarding elections. 

2 Candidates should have the ability to verify the 
authenticity of content originating from their 
campaigns and have access to procedural or 
legal mechanisms to address instances where 
their likeness or content is manipulated by AI to 
mislead the public during elections. 

3 Political campaigns should have the resources to 
safeguard against cyber threats and effectively 
utilize AI, with access to affordable, easily 
deployable tools, training, and support. 

4 Election authorities should be able to ensure 
a secure and resilient election process and 
have access to tools and services that enable 
this process. 

Detection. Microsoft uses advanced tools and 
capabilities to monitor, analyze, and attribute 
malicious activities or campaigns that aim to disrupt, 
influence, or manipulate elections and elections 
infrastructure. We leverage our global network of 
partners and sources to gather intelligence on the 
threat landscape and the actors behind it. 

Response. Microsoft responds to and mitigates 
the threats to elections around the world through 
several means. The Digital Crimes Unit uses 
its legal and technical expertise to disrupt the 
malicious activities and campaigns intended 
to compromise, sabotage, or interfere with the 
elections. Microsoft Incident Response and other 
Microsoft security partners help political and 
elections customers respond to and recover from 
active cyber incidents via our Election Security 
Advisors program.39 In early 2024, we launched a site 
where certified candidates in any national or federal 
election can directly report deceptive AI election 
content on Microsoft’s platforms. 

Collaboration. We collaborate with public 
and private stakeholders globally who share a 
similar goal of protecting the electoral process. 
This includes local elections officials and elections 
commissions, working across the tech sector 
on initiatives like the Tech Accord to Combat 
Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections,40 and with 
government agencies or law enforcement bodies 
when appropriate.

Cyber Point of View: UK 

A continuously improving 
security partnership 

Microsoft and the UK’s National Cyber Security 
Centre (NCSC) have been in partnership for over 
20 years. From securing user devices to covering 
the UK Government’s broader cloud ecosystem, we 
are building a secure foundation to protect from 
the most common cyberattacks. 

Together, they have developed the “Secure 
Configuration Blueprint” to help government 
departments configure Microsoft 365 in a way 
that helps meet their statutory obligations. 
The blueprint leverages the service’s inbuilt 
features and capabilities to lower residual risk. It is 
the leading practice published by the NCSC and 
Microsoft, drawing on extensive experience across 
the UK Government and industry. 

Additionally, secure configuration practices have 
been extended beyond the UK Government to 
include principles for manufacturers of enterprise\-
connected devices and networking equipment. 

Manufacturers can use the principles to determine 
which security mitigations can be designed and 
built into their products by default, and, in parallel, 
organizations can use the same principles as 
a framework to assist in the procurement and 
validation of secure, enterprise\-connected devices. 

Not only does this reduce the complexity of the 
procurement process, it increases the speed 
of deployment. 

The ultimate goal of this partnership is to enhance 
the security posture of public and private sector 
organizations in the UK, ensuring data protection, 
effective collaboration, and reliable services.

Introduction: AI’s impact on cybersecurity 

We are at the start of what could 
become one of the most transformative 
technological eras in modern history. 
Much has been said and written about 
how AI can have a significant effect on 
every industry, but the impact it can have 
on how businesses secure their most 
important data and assets in the face 
of ever\-increasing cybersecurity threats 
will be one of the most critical uses of 
this technology. 

The deployment and utilization of AI and agents 
will be vital, especially with threat actors becoming 
more sophisticated in their tactics every day. 
But as history has shown, technology can have 
the ability to elevate our human potential, and 
through innovation, collaboration and responsible 
use of generative AI and agents, defenders will 
be positioned to take on cybersecurity’s toughest 
challenges and work toward making the world safer 
for all. 

Shawn Bice 
Corporate Vice President, 
Cloud Ecosystem Security 

Organizations of all sizes around the world are facing 
the same challenges: infinite amounts of data to 
manage, more endpoints to secure, and a shortage 
of talent to operate security environments that are 
becoming more complex every day. Cybersecurity is 
a top priority for businesses of all sizes, but at the 
same time, cybersecurity is an infinite game that has 
no winner and no end. Defenders must constantly 
be vigilant as the landscape becomes more intricate. 
With threat actor adoption of AI, the economics and 
sophistication of attacks are changing rapidly, and 
with that, the sophistication of how we must defend. 

Generative AI is ushering in a new era of 
cybersecurity that can put defenders one step ahead 
of threat actors. The adoption of large language 
models (LLMs) tailored for security operation 
scenarios will see a shift from humans having to write 
manual automation of repetitive tasks to AI systems 
capable of detecting and investigating security 
threats at the skill level of security professionals. 
AI can help develop a thorough understanding of a 
security incident and how to respond in a fraction of 
the time it would take a person to manually process 
a multitude of alerts, malicious code files, and 
corresponding impact analysis. 

Not only can this significantly reduce the time to 
identify, investigate, and respond to an incident from 
days to minutes, but this AI\-driven threat analysis 
provides the opportunity for security teams to learn 
and train in real\-time, helping to reduce the skills 
gap and freeing up experienced analysts to focus on 
more important tasks. 

Today, the industry has taken the first steps to add 
assistive agency into products, and more autonomy 
will be created over time, enabling agents to 
perform tasks, monitor, and take action proactively 
and in collaboration with security teams. AI agents 
will use language models in incredible ways to get 
much closer to the way security analysts operate in 
reasoning, decision making, and task completion. 
Not only will we see security teams supported by 
these agents, but we will also see agents working 
together to investigate and resolve incidents. 
Agents will respond to events when activated or 
given permission by an analyst, and Microsoft sees 
a world where soon AI agents will potentially reason, 
make mistakes, learn from mistakes, and work 
together like a team of experts.

Understanding how 
generative AI systems work 

Generative AI is one of the most impactful 
technological shifts of the past several decades. 
Its tremendous range of applications could put it 
not only into thousands of existing systems and 
business processes, but into a range of entirely 
new processes. 

However, a rapidly changing world likewise creates 
opportunities for threat actors, who can often adapt 
to changes faster than defenders. To protect against 
this, it’s important to understand how generative AI 
works and how to apply the techniques of safety and 
security to it. 

Predictive vs. generative AI: In traditional 
predictive AI, people build individualized models 
using their own data. Since they have control over 
the process, they try to build controls things like 
fairness, training data leakage, and data poisoning. 
Predictive AI is good at analyzing large fields of 
data, classifying, predicting, and recommending. 
Generative AI, on the other hand, is best understood 
as a different technology – one where general\-
purpose models are shared by millions of users and 
have no special data access. Generative AI models 
are good at summarizing or analyzing natural 
language data and role\-playing characters like 
“customer service rep” or “math teacher.” 

How they work: First\-generation generative AI 
applications were just bare language models for 
which users carefully crafted inputs (“prompts”) to 
receive outputs. Because they were creative tools, 
they were very prone to hallucination and required 
careful prompting for effective use. Second\-
generation applications, widespread today, are 
more complex, with many skills. Some of these 
skills are ordinary functions written in normal 
programming languages; these might look up data 
or call another system to perform some action. 
Like any function, they require very specific inputs. 
Such skills are natural points for controls since they 
are the only way the AI system can access outside 
data. Other skills call the model—for example, to 
summarize or analyze data, create content (such 
as by roleplaying a writer or programmer) or to 
improve data by roleplaying an editor. Those skills 
work by fusing user inputs, additional data fetched 
by other skills, and their own data to create a 
prompt, automating what people did by hand in the 
first generation. Skills are then called by a central 
function that defines the AI system; this might either 
be an ordinary function, running known steps in 
turn, or an AI function that roleplays a subject\-
matter expert and asks it to come up with a plan 
using those known skills.

Such systems have natural safety intervention 
points. Metaprompts are the step that tell the model 
about the character it’s roleplaying, things it should 
avoid, and so on, and are a key place for defense. 
“Editor” steps are a kind of metacognition, where a 
second AI looks at the outputs of the first to see if 
its statements are grounded in its known list of facts, 
if they are aligned with its compliance or strategic 
goals, and so on. Filters pre\- or post\-process data 
using ordinary software, predictive AI, or generative 
AI to catch suspicious situations and handle 
them differently. 

For example, a question\-answering system might 
first use a filter to see if it’s being asked something 
inappropriate or outside its expertise. If not, it role\-
plays a subject\-matter expert to figure out searches 
it should run; then again as a subject\-matter expert 
evaluates the credibility of each page and extracts 
its key ideas; then role\-playing a writer, it combines 
these to form an answer to the original question. 
Finally, as an editor, it checks to see if every part of 
its response is appropriately grounded and if any key 
points were missed. 

Future generative AI systems (“agents”) are likely to 
add capabilities like memory (learning as they work 
with you), operation over longer timescales than a 
single conversation, and more autonomy, reacting to 
events other than user inputs.

Introduction 

Emerging threat landscape AI for defense Advancing global AI security 

Two key insights 

As we’ve developed a large range of generative AI 
systems, we’ve found some important insights about 
the process. 

1\. Building is easy; testing is hard

Generative AI changes the traditional relationship 
between development and testing investment. 
In traditional software, 90% of the work goes into 
writing software that will function. With generative 
AI, writing a system is much easier, with significant 
features being “quick projects” rather than multi\-
month investments. However, that AI system will 
work correctly only in the handful of cases that the 
developers imagined as they worked; the majority of 
the work will be in testing and tuning as the system 
is evaluated on uncommon inputs, adversarial 
inputs, or even just inputs from users who think 
differently from the developers. 

As a system is built, it’s important to make a list of 
the ways in which the system could potentially go 
wrong and develop a large test suite of example 
inputs that may trigger those outcomes. Likewise, 
there should be lists of intended and “uncommon” 
inputs as well. Team diversity is key at this stage, 
since without it the team can’t adequately imagine 
how real\-world use will look and will miss critical 
risks. Generative AI can itself amplify a team’s ability 
in this space, turning individual examples into large 
multi\-lingual lists. 

Then, using a test framework, these lists can be 
run against the system in bulk, with generative 
AI once again helping efficiently evaluate the 
outputs for correctness. These tests can re\-run 
whenever the system is updated, much like ordinary 
integration tests. 

2\. Generative AI security is 
nondeterministic

Generative AI systems are software, and traditional 
software security remains important. In addition 
to that, however, generative AI systems face risks 
from anomalous natural\-language (or media) 
inputs. These are nondeterministic, especially in that 
variations in language or phrasing can profoundly 
change behavior. In fact, most “jailbreak” attacks can 
be summarized as “social engineering works against 
generative AI.” The resulting vulnerabilities can’t be 
deterministically patched, even in theory. 

Fortunately, it is possible to secure systems with 
nondeterministic components; we call those 
components “people.” Microsoft has found that 
asking “How would you secure this if it were a 
person?” scales very effectively to generative AI. 
Where an organization would vet a person, they 
should test a system thoroughly and adversarially. 
Where it would train a person, it should adjust 
metaprompts and filters so that they behave 
correctly. Where it would have multiple eyes check 
and approve sensitive decisions, organizations 
should do the same—both by having one AI look 
over the results of another (metacognition) and 
involving humans in the process. 

A surprising fact that makes metacognition more 
effective is that since generative AI is trained on 
human language, a brief summary of a character it 
is meant to roleplay allows it to infer broad aspects 
of that personality without the user having to specify 

These attacks are different 

Map human ideas to generative AI safety 

They’re nondeterministic: 

▪ Saying the same thing twice won’t have 

the same effect

▪ Slight changes in phrasing may change 

the outcome

This means you can’t “patch” them the same way 
you do traditional security vulnerabilities 

For a person, you might... 

 Vet them 
▪ 
▪ Train them 
▪ Monitor them 
▪ Have multiple eyes check and approve 

sensitive decisions 
▪ Build trust over time

those qualities manually. That means, for example, 
telling the system it is an experienced newspaper 
editor or computer hacker lets it do meaningful edits 
and safety checks from those perspectives.

Introduction 

Emerging threat landscape AI for defense Advancing global AI security 

Emerging threat landscape 

The AI landscape is changing 
tremendously quickly, and any analysis 
will therefore inevitably be out of date 
by the time it is published. While details 
of any summary will quickly become 
obsolete, its principles may prove useful 
for much longer. 

The generative AI 
threat landscape 

When discussing AI threats, a first division is 
between system threats—issues like security 
vulnerabilities, where securing one system effectively 
mitigates the risk—and ecosystem threats, where 
attackers can choose the most vulnerable system 
with which to achieve their goals. 

System threats 

The key system threats Microsoft has seen 
are system compromise, overreliance, and 
content exposure. 

▪ System compromise: The key threat here is 

cross\-prompt injection attacks (XPIA, also known 
as indirect prompt injection), where the system 
is processing data under the control of a third 
party (for example, email messages or Word 
documents). Attackers insert malicious payloads 
to exploit vulnerabilities in the way the system 
combines inputs to form LLM prompts to do things 
such as run commands with a victim’s credentials, 
take over systems, and/or exfiltrate data. 

▪ Overreliance: Users tend to overrate the 

reliability of AI output. The best mitigations for 
these threats are often in the user experience 
(UX) or business practice. Overreliance comes in 
four forms: 

▪ Naive, where users aren’t aware of the 

limitations of the AI. 

▪ Rushed, when a lack of time or confirmation 
blindness means users don’t check outputs. 

▪ Forced, when the user is physically unable 
to check the output (for example, vision 
augmentation for the blind, or systems that 
create apps for non\-programmers). 

▪ Motivated, when a user offers “the AI said so” 
as an excuse to do what they already wanted. 

▪ Content exposure: A threat exists when 

operators are exposed to content such as hate 
speech, violence, radicalization or child sexual 
abuse material (CSAM) that is directly harmful to 
them. Fortunately, this threat can be defended 
against with filters and metaprompts, such as with 
Azure AI Content Safety. 

▪ 

Infrastructure compromise: Traditional 
cybersecurity threats against the underlying 
storage, network, computing, and supply chain 
continue to be significant. 

In the coming year, 
we anticipate the biggest 
rises in automated fraud 
and election interference, 
CSAM and NCII production, 
and the use of XPIA and 
deepfake impersonation 
as cyberattack and 
fraud channels.

Introduction 

Emerging threat landscape AI for defense Advancing global AI security 

Ecosystem threats 

Ecosystem threats often require defense outside the 
AI system. 

▪ 

Impersonation: Use of image, audio, and 
video deepfakes to impersonate individuals. 
Specific threats include fraud, blackmail, 
coercion, defamation, and information warfare. 
Defense against this threat includes moving 
communication to authenticated channels. 

▪ Content production: Creation of harmful content 
for dissemination such as CSAM, non\-consensual 
intimate images, disinformation, child grooming 
scripts, or spam. Threats in this category are 
diverse and are typically amplifications of existing 
threats, sometimes on a large scale. 

▪ Nefarious knowledge acquisition: Acquisition 
of information that helps threat actors upgrade 
their skills, such as how to make drugs or 
biological weapons. This threat has not emerged 
at scale and is being actively researched by the 
security community. 

▪ Cyber threat amplification: Automated 

generation of malware, and, more importantly, 
attack command and control infrastructure, 
which could give lower\-tier threat actors access 
to persistent attack capabilities previously limited 
to advanced actors. There is significant risk that 
attackers will develop AI techniques faster than 
defenders adopt AI\-powered defense systems, 
and attackers will take advantage of that gap until 
the defenders catch up.

▪ Direct social attacks: Malicious activities such 
as scams, phishing, propaganda, and terrorist 
recruitment can be automated using generative 
AI and operated at far larger scales than before. 
The cyber intelligence community anticipates 
a large rise in all of these categories, driven by 
AI enablement. Defenses against them may 
focus on providing AI support to the recipient 
and interdicting payloads at the communication 
system level.

▪

Indirect social attacks: Automated harassment 
and defamation are very difficult to counter. 
Because someone can be harassed by targeting 
their friends, colleagues, and the public, a defense 
strategy for this threat type is not yet clear.

As defenders, particularly governments, are 
considering the threats associated with the abuse 
of AI, it is important to keep in mind that many 
of the future victims will not have the benefit of 
automated systems and programs to defend them. 
Many ecosystem threats will have an immediate 
impact on the most vulnerable targets—humans. 
As difficult as it currently is to stop multi\-billion\-
dollar frauds against vulnerable groups like the 
elderly, AI’s impersonation capabilities will make it 
even harder for victims to identify and resist fraud. 

In the coming year, we anticipate the biggest rises 
in automated fraud and election interference,

Introduction 

Emerging threat landscape AI for defense Advancing global AI security 

Sophisticated AI\-enabled 
human targeting 

Behind every bot is a real person. As AI is 
increasingly used to help people get more efficient, 
threat actors are learning that they can use the 
same AI efficiencies as a force multiplier in their 
targeting efforts. 

Targeting high\-value individuals 

Threat actors target high\-value individuals at 
organizations because they have access to trade 
secrets, financial systems, key strategies, and other 
sensitive and proprietary intellectual property. 
Because AI is very capable of performing most of 
the time\-consuming research needed to identify 
lucrative targets, it frees the actors up to conduct 
other activities. This emerging threat landscape of 
AI\-enabled targeting is also aided by the machine 
learning (ML) aspect of AI. This is because bots 
can rapidly learn from the sum total of human 
knowledge documented on the internet. 

We expect two diverging trends pertaining to 
AI\-enabled cyber\-threat actors and defenders. 
Whichever party masters AI faster will have a 
near\-term advantage. However, when it comes to 
AI\-enabled human targeting, threats will be more 
difficult to detect and defend against—even with AI 
tools assisting defensive strategies. 

The defensive advantage 

The defensive advantage against AI\-enabled cyber 
threats comes in the form of defenders’ ability 
to deploy AI into defensive tools and systems. 
If organizations are early adopters of AI tools, they 
can use ML to rapidly ingest and infer evolving 
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), thus 
detecting and preventing malware and malicious 
code. Hesitance to incorporate AI into defensive 
strategies on the other hand, will open a window 
of opportunity for threat actors to exploit gaps 
they identify with AI tools. This means the early AI 
adopters will enjoy a near\-term advantage afforded 
by the nimbleness of AI. 

The offensive advantage 

The offensive advantage of AI\-enabled human 
targeting comes from AI’s ability to: 

1 Rapidly perform functions that previously took 

humans months or even years. 

2 Avoid hallmark mistakes humans make in their 

targeting operations. 

For example, a threat team that previously relied on 
manual operations to identify targets, research them, 
develop a social engineering approach, and execute 
it can assign roughly 90% of this work to AI, freeing 
up human resources to perform more nuanced tasks 
AI is not yet effective at performing. 

Since AI can perform these labor\-intensive tasks 
far more rapidly than a human, it also reduces 
the time to target. This operational efficiency is 
complemented by the fact that AI won’t make, for 
example, spelling and grammar errors that humans 
make in phishing communications. 

The impact of AI in attacks is already being felt in 
the wider cybersecurity community. Tools in the 
multi\-factor authentication toolbox are becoming 
vulnerable, and AI has demonstrated it can defeat 
CAPTCHA,49 which was specifically designed to 
stop bots. The use of AI will expand the threat 
landscape by making bots harder to detect, more 
pervasive, and more adaptable due to increasingly 
sophisticated ML capabilities. 

With the Internet of Things (IoT) market growing at 
42% per year,50 we also expect pervasive targeting 
of personal and home\-use products. Overall, the 
democratization of AI will enable unsophisticated 
threat actors to become more capable and 
effective without having to become more 
technically proficient.

Emerging techniques 
in AI enabled attacks 

While some TTPs are in their infancy and little 
more than proof of concept, others are already 
being widely used. 

This section discusses some of the TTPs threat actors 
are currently using and evolving for use against their 
targets in the social engineering phase of attacks. 
We expect threat actors to rapidly evolve and deploy 
these TTPs in the near term, and the variations will 
continue to evolve and expand. 

AI\-enabled spear phishing and whaling 

AI is evolving spear phishing and whaling by 
coupling AI with malware, creating a tool that lies 
dormant until it identifies its intended target and 
deploys. Threat actors can focus their attacks on 
highly specific targets and hone\-in on exfiltrating 
only the most useful information. Without users 
knowing, the AI uses device cameras, speakers, 
and GPS for target verification. By the time it is 
discovered, the malware has already exfiltrated the 
target information.

“Résumé swarming” and steganography 

Threat actors can use AI to scrape keywords and 
qualifications from job postings and develop 
“perfect” candidates in the virtual world. 
AI can then generate hundreds or thousands of 
variations of highly qualified—but imaginary— 
candidates’ résumés to apply for open positions at 
unsuspecting companies. 

These résumés can even use steganography 
techniques to embed invisible information to 
increase their chances of passing automated 
screening tools, getting the applicant selected for 
interviews and ultimately hired. Threat actors can 
use this technique in their attempts to emplace 
insiders within an organization to steal trade 
secrets, intelligence, or other sensitive information. 
In another variation of this technique, threat actors 
may create a limited number of ideal candidates 
alongside a swarm of AI\-generated unqualified 
résumés to break screening processes.

Emerging threat landscape 

Deepfakes and other variations 
on social engineering 

Using AI’s capability to rapidly conduct expansive 
research, threat actors can discover massive 
amounts of information about targeted individuals 
and programs. 

This means they can then develop highly tailored 
social media profiles with which to contact thought 
leaders, subject\-matter experts, and other high value 
targets for social engineering. Further enhancing this 
false persona technique, AI\-enabled deepfake tools 
can also be used to create fake social media profiles 
impersonating people known to the target. 

Threat actors can establish the impersonating 
persona’s bona fides by using video teleconferencing 
or phone calls to deploy real\-time deepfake contact 
with voice and video synthesis. Or, using AI bots, 
threat actors can automate a substantial portion of 
communication before actual human interaction 
is required. All these AI\-assisted approaches act 
as a force multiplier that can help threat actors 
simultaneously approach a virtually unlimited 
number of potential targets to identify the most 
viable targets for further development. 

With the increasing sophistication and quality of 
deepfakes, we anticipate that it is highly likely that 
criminals will also use this TTP for fraud, identity 
theft, blackmail, and extortion. Nearly flawless 
deepfake video with audio can generate extremely 
convincing (fake) evidence to compel and coerce 
victims to comply with criminals’ demands. 

Even knowing the artifacts are fake, many 
victims may choose to comply simply to avoid 
embarrassment or potential negative perceptions. 

A strong mitigation strategy will seek to reduce the 
threat landscape through predictive and preventative 
activities. Incorporating AI into risk mitigation 
activities means defenders can evolve at the same 
or a greater rate as threat actors. As discussed in the 
data security section of this report, discovering and 
prioritizing data assets is foundational. Threat actors 
rely on disorganization, poor communication, lack 
of consensus, and unwillingness to invest in non\-
revenue generating activities within organizations. 
We therefore recommend mapping identified gaps 
to key stakeholders responsible for managing the 
associated mitigation strategy. Lastly, one of the 
best mitigation strategies is robust training and 
awareness campaigns. 

Actionable Insights 

1 Report criminal and suspicious activity 
to the appropriate law enforcement 
organization in your region. 

2 Reporting suspicious activity, whether or 

not you fall victim to it, enables defenders 
to better understand the threat, identify 
what’s being targeted, take action to protect 
those targets, and educate the population 
about protecting against those threats.

Emerging threat landscape 

Nation\-state threat actors 
using AI for influence 
operations 

Nation\-state threat actor groups, such as those 
backed by Russia, Iran, and China, are increasingly 
incorporating AI\-generated or enhanced content 
into their influence operations in search of greater 
productivity, efficiency, and audience engagement. 

We assess this content has had a limited effect on 
the impact of nation\-state influence operations thus 
far, but if integrated into otherwise creative and 
multifaceted influence operations, AI may prove 
to offer a significant capability in reaching and 
engaging audiences in the future.

More recently, the actor attempted to fan the 
flames of discord around the Israel\-Hamas war 
by circulating photorealistic AI\-generated images 
of purported protests, as Israel\-Palestine related 
university campus protests surged across the United 
States in late April to May 2024\. 

China\-affiliated influence actors 
favor AI\-generated imagery 

China\-affiliated threat actors’ increasing use of AI 
to enhance influence campaigns, especially those 
targeting elections around the world, distinguishes 
them from other nation\-states using AI. 

In the past year, Microsoft observed China\-
linked threat actors utilizing various generative 
AI technologies to create sleek, compelling visual 
narratives. Microsoft uncovered a series of AI\-
generated memes aimed at the United States that 
emphasized domestic discord and criticized the 
Biden administration. 

Taizi Flood is the most prolific threat actor in this 
arena, using third\-party AI technology, including 
technology that generates virtual news anchors, 
for its online campaigns. With influence operations 
spanning over 175 websites and 58 languages, Taizi 
Flood has continuously mounted reactive messaging 
campaigns around high\-profile geopolitical events, 
with a focus on portraying the United States in an 
unfavorable light and furthering Beijing’s interests 
in the Asia\-Pacific region. During the Maui, Hawaii 
wildfires in August 2023, the actor used AI\-
generated images of burning coastal roads and 
residences to augment the conspiratorial narratives 
about US Government complicity it spread across 
social media platforms.

generated images intended to portray 
protests at a named US university.

Nation\-state threat actors using AI for influence operations continued 

Russia\-affiliated influence actors using 
audio\-focused AI across mediums 

Russia\-affiliated threat actors often adopt a 
more nuanced strategy in their AI tactics, though 
the effectiveness of their campaigns has had 
mixed results. 

For example, they create fully synthetic deepfake 
videos of prominent political figures but the videos 
struggle to gain significant online engagement 
because they are quickly exposed as fake. 

Audio manipulations have proven more influential 
in shaping audience perception. Two days before 
Slovakia’s 2023 election—a tight race between pro\-
Western and pro\-Kremlin parties—AI\-generated 
audio of the pro\-Western party leader discussing 
how to rig the election appeared online.51 The 
incident represented a test case of how vulnerable 
elections around the world could be to the malicious 
use of AI by nation\-state threat actors. 

Emerging threat landscape 

92 

In February 2024, pro\-Russian social media accounts 
circulated a fabricated video, falsely claiming 
that Ukrainian authorities planned to assassinate 
French President Emmanuel Macron. While the 
visual component of the video appeared to be 
from an authentic France24 broadcast, the audio 
component was AI\-generated.52 The video gained 
traction online and former Russian President Dimitry 
Medvedev later repeated the false narrative in a 
post to X, without explicitly referencing the video 
itself.53 Although attribution is unclear in both the 
Slovak and French examples, the targets, narratives, 
themes and tactics are consistent with pro\-Russia 
influence activities. 

Russia also used a malicious application of AI in 
influence operations surrounding the 2024 Paris 
Summer Olympics. In mid\-2023, Microsoft identified 
a fake documentary titled “Olympics Has Fallen” 
disseminated by Russian\-affiliated influence actor 
Storm\-1679 on Telegram. 

The video featured AI\-generated audio that 
mimicked the voice of American actor Tom Cruise 
criticizing the International Olympic Committee 
and its leadership. This was Storm\-1679’s first use of 
AI\-enhanced content for influence efforts. In June 
2024, the actor launched a sequel, “Olympics Has 
Fallen II,” this time featuring AI\-generated audio 
impersonating businessman Elon Musk. For both 
videos, Storm\-1679 appears to have allocated 
significant time and resources. This ongoing 
initiative reflects a persistent effort to target Western 
audience information spaces where this actor 
has traditionally struggled to effectively amplify 
its content. 

Iran\-affiliated influence actors are 
in the early stages of AI integration 

In contrast to actors supporting Russia and China, 
pro\-Iran groups have so far employed AI more 
sparingly. Nevertheless, they are gradually increasing 
use of AI\-generated or enhanced images and videos 
as key components of their messaging campaigns, 
particularly against Israel. 

We observed Cotton Sandstorm disrupting 
streaming television services in the UAE and 
elsewhere in December 2023 under the guise of 
a persona called “For Humanity.” For Humanity 
published videos on Telegram showing the group 
hacking into three online streaming services 
and replacing several news channels with a fake 
transmission featuring a likely AI\-generated anchor 
that claimed to show images of Palestinians injured 
and killed by Israeli military operations. 

News outlets and viewers in the UAE, Canada, and 
the UK reported disruptions in streaming television 
programming, including BBC, that matched For 
Humanity’s claims.54 In April 2024, amid Iran’s 
airstrikes on Israel, a new Iranian cyber persona, 
“Montaghemoun,” posted threatening messages in 
Hebrew, English, and Farsi that included videos and 
images that were likely created with AI.55 

A still image from the fabricated video. The footage 
features a well\-known French news anchor with likely 
AI\-generated audio of his voice. The overlaid title 
graphics were digitally manipulated. The earliest 
observed instances of the video included Russian 
subtitles, as demonstrated here.

Nation\-state threat actors using AI for influence operations continued 

Limiting foreign influence operations in 
the modern era 

Influence operations have been used throughout 
history by both state and non\-state actors to 
shape public opinion and achieve strategic 
goals. Because they are recognized tools of soft 
power, there are established boundaries for such 
activity under international law. The principle of 
nonintervention, for example, safeguards national 
autonomy and, in certain cases, prohibits direct 
interference in the external and internal affairs of 
sovereign states. Activity which covertly manipulates 
the economic or political systems of another country, 
for example, could cross that line. 

However, existing limitations of foreign influence 
operations under international law are no longer 
sufficient in the modern era. The emergence of social 
media and the advancements in generative AI have 
significantly changed the landscape. Therefore, it is 
imperative to reassess the impact and boundaries 
of these activities. Similar to the norms established 
by the United Nations to restrict state\-sponsored 
cyberattacks, there should be comparable norms 
to regulate foreign influence operations in the 
online space. 

Montaghemoun” (meaning Avengers in Arabic), posted threatening messages in Hebrew, English, and Farsi across its 
social media accounts in the days leading up to the Iranian attack’s against Israel, including posting multiple threatening 
videos and images Microsoft assesses were created with AI. 

Emerging threat landscape 

93 

Microsoft recommends that states embrace the 
following limitations on foreign influence operations: 

Limits on targets 

▪ Crisis/emergency scenarios: In an emergency 
or crisis – including wildfires, floods, extreme 
weather events, and chemical/radiation spills 
– foreign influence operations should not seek 
to manipulate civilians with respect to the crisis. 
When lives are at stake, reliable information is 
critical for safety. 

▪ Emergency/humanitarian response 

organizations: Undermining public trust in 
organizations involved in humanitarian or 
emergency response missions is unacceptable. 
Governments deliberately spreading or 
promoting misleading information about medical 
First Responders or humanitarian assistance 
efforts abroad should equally be prohibited. 

▪ Elections: Covert interference in elections via 
foreign influence operations online must be 
prohibited. Such a commitment was already 
included in the 2018 Paris Call for Trust and 
Security in Cyberspace, which has the support of 
80 national governments from around the world. 

▪ Vulnerable/marginalized communities: 

States should refrain from foreign influence 
campaigns that advocate national, racial or 
religious hatred or which incite violence against 
protected groups, including racial and ethnic 
minorities and LGBTQ\+ populations. 

Limits on tools and techniques 

▪ Covert use of AI: States should not secretly 

create or knowingly use synthetic audio, images 
or video content generated by AI, to covertly 
mislead or coerce citizens of other countries. 

▪ Theft/abuse of social media data: States 

should refrain from stealing or misusing data 
on foreign citizens held by private companies 
for the purpose of developing covert influence 
operations targeting a foreign populace.

AI for defense 

Microsoft’s significant investment in 
AI innovation is aimed at providing 
cybersecurity defenders with an 
asymmetric advantage over attackers 
in the realm of defense. 

In our efforts, we prioritize cutting\-edge research 
and the development of groundbreaking solutions 
like Copilot for Security. These solutions amplify 
defenders’ efforts by optimizing resources and 
scaling cybersecurity endeavors. This is particularly 
crucial considering the significant shortage of skilled 
cybersecurity workers, which poses one of the 
biggest challenges in the field of cybersecurity. 

AI for defense 

94 

Currently, cybersecurity teams operate at their limits, 
facing staffing constraints, escalating regulatory 
compliance demands, and an ever\-growing 
number of increasingly sophisticated adversaries. 
However, the introduction of AI will change this 
workload, offering various benefits to both attackers 
and defenders. 

For defenders, the “automated ingenuity” of 
generative AI can now be applied across the entire 
defense chain, from initial detection of anomalies 
to prompt triage and response. Beyond merely 
enhancing existing security operations centers 
(SOC), AI holds the potential to introduce entirely 
new methods of defense. For instance, it enables 
persistent systems that constantly monitor for 
vulnerabilities and promptly address any breaches. 
Additionally, AI streamlines the sharing of 
information among defenders, transforming it from 
a labor\-intensive manual process into a continuous, 
automated one. 

“AI holds the potential to be as much of a 
transformative technological revolution for 
human beings as things like electricity or modern 
computing, if not possibly more so; a tool that 
opens up benefits across the board, transforming 
zero\-sum problems into non\-zero\-sum 
opportunities and creating massive net long\-term 
gains for humanity. 

But, as we’ve seen repeatedly throughout the 
course of history, when in the wrong hands, any 
sufficiently new and powerful tool that people are 
given can be used by those people to cause harm. 
The good news is that these same AI tools, when 
paired with creativity, innovation and diligence, 
can put those of us on the side of defense and 
security ahead of disruptive threat actors, and allow 
everyone a chance to fully realize the tremendous 
benefits that AI can bring.”

Harnessing AI to detect 
cyberattacks 

Our researchers are developing a novel AI 
approach to detect and disrupt cyberattacks and 
“endpoint stories.” 

Endpoint stories are narratives of endpoint activities 
generated from data collected from physical devices 
that connect to a network system. These include 
mobile devices, desktop computers, virtual 
machines, embedded devices and servers. The data 
source for these stories is Microsoft Defender for 
Endpoint (MDE). 

Disrupting attacks by combining endpoint 
detection and response with AI 

Our AI models are integrated with MDE, a cloud\-
based security solution that provides comprehensive 
protection for endpoints. MDE collects and 
processes data from millions of devices and uses it 
to generate endpoint stories. AI models are then 
automatically invoked, and when a model detects 
a HOK attack, an alert is created in the MDE portal. 
Based on the AI decision, MDE can automatically56 
isolate an affected device, temporarily disable 
compromised user accounts, and take additional 
actions to disrupt the attack. This way, MDE can 
thwart the attack before it causes more harm. 

Detecting hidden attacks with AI 

Extending AI across cybersecurity 

Hands\-on\-keyboard (HOK) attacks, where 
cybercriminals directly interact with compromised 
systems, are a major concern for enterprises. 
These attacks are hard to detect because attackers 
often use common administrative tools and 
techniques to blend in with legitimate activities, 
and attackers are able to move through networks 
in real\-time and respond to what they find in the 
environment. To detect these attacks, we use 
LLMs that are fine\-tuned to analyze endpoint story 
narratives and identify anomalous or suspicious 
activities. These models can learn from the context 
and semantics of the stories and flag potential 
threats that might otherwise go unnoticed. 

Our approach is not only effective for detecting HOK 
attacks, but also has wider implications for other 
areas of cybersecurity. Leveraging the understanding 
capabilities of LLMs, AI models such as ours can be 
used to analyze and find malicious activities using 
large and complex data sources such as network 
logs, email communications, web traffic, and social 
media. This can help us uncover hidden patterns, 
trends, and insights that can inform our security 
strategies and policies. We are also exploring the 
latest methods, such as leveraging the Phi family of 
models,57 to improve our AI models for detection of 
attacks and suspicious activities.

AI’s early impact on the security operations center (SOC) 

Scale, efficiency, and speed are key components 
affecting defenders’ ability to detect and respond to 
incidents. On average, it takes 277 days to identify 
and contain a breach, with 207 days for identification 
and 70 days for containment.58 By leveraging AI, 
defenders can significantly reduce this lag. 

Microsoft has invested heavily in AI to help SOCs 
upskill and operate at speeds beyond human 
capability to tackle threat actors. In a 2023 study we 
found that novice users were able to perform 26% 
faster and were 44% more accurate across all tasks 
when using Copilot for Security.

Examples 

During advanced human\-operated ransomware 
attacks, we have seen the time from initial pre\-
HOK (hands on keyboard) alert to the encryption 
event averaging a mere 16 hours, underscoring 
the importance of operating fast to remediate the 
actor from the network. As mentioned, prioritizing 
incidents is a significant challenge that impacts time 
to resolve/mitigate. AI security solutions provide 
more than just a graphical representation of events; 
they generate a comprehensive incident summary 

that allows SOC analysts to quickly understand the 
situation and identify human\-operated ransomware 
targeting mission\-critical devices and users, enabling 
swift and decisive action. 

To address the incident, the analyst must dive 
into indicators of compromise. Using AI, the 
analyst can instead assess an encoded command 
line run on a suspicious device from the incident. 
What would have taken a junior analyst dozens 
of minutes and several tools can now be achieved 
at machine\-speed.

Seven areas of efficiencies 
in Microsoft security 
operations 

AI has demonstrated significant benefits to 
cybersecurity by enhancing threat detection, 
response, analysis, and prediction. AI can also 
be used for various other tasks within a security 
organization, which often involves processing large 
volumes of unstructured data to gain insights, 
answer questions, and make informed decisions. 
Microsoft is leveraging AI in seven key areas of 
security operations. 

AI for defense 

97 

AI is not only useful for first line 
of defense operations, but its 
capability to transform behind\-
the\-scenes daily processes is 
also significant and promising. 
Modernizing these processes is 
essential for scaling up security 
operations and making the best 
use of human expertise. 

One notable example is the use of 
AI for triaging requests, which is 
saving at least 20 hours per week 
per person on one of our internal 
response teams. 

1 Triaging requests and tickets. Teams in a 
security organization receive large volumes 
of requests and tickets. Depending on the 
complexity of the logic that determines how 
these items are dispositioned, large language 
models (LLMs) can speed up the triage process 
and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of 
responding teams. LLMs can use the specifics 
of a new request and, comparing them to how 
similar requests were dispositioned in the past, 
decide what to do. LLMs can additionally use 
relevant policies, controls, and other material to 
inform these decisions. At Microsoft, one of our 
internal response teams receives on average 25 
requests each week. This volume is expected to 
double over the next six months. Without LLMs, 
initial triage of a request takes approximately 
three hours. The team developed an LLM 
solution, which takes seconds to recommend 
response actions based on information provided 
in the requests and guidelines on when each 
action is appropriate. The LLMs can also 
generate follow\-up questions if the information 
in the request is insufficient to recommend 
an action. The use of LLMs in this scenario is 
estimated to save at least 20 hours per person, 
per week. 

2 Prioritizing work items. Keeping an 

organization secure and compliant involves 
a constant stream of work items of varying 
importance and time\-criticality. AI can assess 
the priority of a given item based on how similar 
items were prioritized in the past. As with the 
previous use case, LLMs can use relevant policies, 
procedures, and other material to determine 
these priorities. Additionally, AI can ensure that 
the prioritization criteria are up to date with the 
ever\-evolving compliance requirements where 
hundreds of regulatory changes happen on a 
daily basis. 

3 Knowledge gathering from diverse external 
sources. Augmenting proprietary in\-house 
datasets with online content (such as threat 
intelligence and information on recent 
vulnerabilities) enables an organization to make 
better decisions. AI can scrape online content 
and extract security\-related information at scale. 
At Microsoft, one of our internal teams identifies 
and processes 50 articles per week. While this 
used to take two hours per article on average, 
using AI, the team is now able to generate 
concise reports from these articles in minutes.

Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2024 

7 areas of efficiencies in Microsoft security operations continued 

4 Knowledge retrieval. A large part of keeping 

an organization secure depends on how 
well\-informed its employees are on security 
policies, best practices, and the remediation 
actions necessary for compliance. However, this 
information is usually fragmented across multiple 
locations, forcing an employee to search for and 
extrapolate it. LLMs can greatly improve this 
experience and generate complete and accurate 
answers, even allowing the user to ask follow\-up 
questions. If integrated with an organization’s 
data on devices and services, the answers can be 
tailored to a specific situation. 

5 Risk assessment. AI can assimilate information 
from diverse sources, whether proprietary or 
publicly available, to bear on the risk of a given 
entity, service, account, etc. AI can leverage 
unstructured organizational knowledge and 
historical precedents to enrich the set of factors 
determining risk. 

6 Learning from the past. Security operations 
constantly generate large volumes of diverse 
artifacts (tickets, reports, playbooks). Looking at 
the evolution of this data over time can provide 
valuable insights into themes, anomalies and 
recurring issues. Much of this historical content 
is unstructured and impractical to manually sift 
through. LLMs can ingest data pertaining to 
previous incidents, violations, remediations and 
other events to uncover valuable learnings that 
help the organization get a comprehensive view 
of past events. For example, analyzing historical 
data from post\-incident reviews can answer 
questions like: 1\) What were the main themes 
in past incidents? 2\) For a given theme, did the 
associated incidents happen over a large span 
of time (indicating an unaddressed root cause) 
or did they happen and then stop (indicating 
successful remediation)? 3\) Have we historically 
seen anything similar to a new incident? 

7 Reporting. As a security organization’s size 
grows, so do reporting needs. AI can help 
combine, consolidate, and distill artifacts such 
as documents and slides into reports whose 
content, level of detail, tone, and length can be 
adjusted depending on the audience and the 
report goal.

From categories to context 

Generative AI allows defenders to use the narrative 
context of the threat as a qualifier to defensive 
actions and remediation. Instead of classifying 
an alert into a known set of categories, the 
differentiation is now built from all surrounding 
contextual information, with remediation dependent 
on the factual findings and not by abstraction into a 
bucket (categorization). 

The technical difference is in moving from 
classification, which is a methodology that abstracts 
similar attacks, to a high\-dimensional proximity 
engine, where the remediation is the statistically 
best next step. The outcome of this method is very 
specific to the collection of all entities and facts of 
the event. This means all the nuances of an event are 
handled and considered without loss of resolution, 
which happens when an event is classified into 
a bucket. 

A good example of the challenges organizations are 
facing and how generative AI could help them is in 
“User Submitted Phish.” Security operations centers 
struggle with a high volume of “user\-submitted 
phish,” alerts that are based on users reporting 
emails they suspect of being phishing attempts. 
An analyst’s attention is needed to determine if the 
email is indeed malicious but due to the volume of 
alerts —which can total hundreds or even thousands 
of emails in a month—some companies use a 
service to prequalify the user\-submitted phish report 
before an analyst investigation. 

The decision whether an email is malicious is not 
easily discerned since many factors come into 
play, with variability in what makes it a phishing 
attempt. Since it is not easy to categorize an email 
as a phishing attempt, a method that looks at the 
specifics of the email without a predetermined rule is 
more advantageous in determining a verdict. 

Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2024 

Using generative AI to 
understand cyberattacks 
and create tailored 
mitigations 

As discussed throughout this report, the frequency 
and severity of cyberattacks have increased 
significantly in recent years. Addressing large 
volumes of attacks requires automation engines 
beyond the current rules\-based approach. 
But volume isn’t the only thing changing. 

There is also a huge growth in the types and 
complexity of attacks. Microsoft Defender for 
Endpoint has seen a significant increase in the 
number of indicators of attack (IOA); from January 
2020 to today, there has been a 79% growth in IOAs.

confronting and remediating attacks. In 2015, it was 
possible to bucket attacks into nine tactics and 96 
techniques and differentiate their treatment with 
rules. Today, the diversity of TTPs requires hundreds 
of differentiated rules and nuanced treatment, 
making it harder than ever to alleviate the volume of 
incidents by automation alone.

Custom remediation task

Predefined remediation tasks 

A rules\-based approach limits your remediation options to predefined tasks. With generative AI, alert treatment 
is generalized to produce a unique remediation that is the predictive next step of the specific facts of the alert. 
Each remediation will be unique to the facts of the alert, and it does not rely on a predetermined classification 
of remediations.

Additional automated enrichments can then be provided including:

▪ Finding a domain’s reputation.

▪ Associating domain, sender, and return path to threat articles.

▪ Checking the same email subject line sent to other users across the organization.

With all added enrichments, we can then leverage 
generative AI to help with a summary, a verdict 
recommendation, and a containment plan. 

Typical prompting examples include:

▪

▪

▪

“Triage the following email and point out what 
you find suspicious? Investigate the Message\-
ID for any inconsistencies or signs of spoofing. 
I’m specifically interested in a sense of urgency, 
generic greetings, spelling or grammar mistakes, 
requests for personal information….”
“Based on the above email investigation, 
summarize the investigation steps that were 
taken and provide supporting evidence on the 
percentage of certainty that this is a true positive 
phishing incident.”
“Based on your investigation, create a 
containment plan.”

AI for defense

100

\-

The culmination of these elements, without a pre
determined rule, is the foundation for a factual 
verdict and the certainty around it. This is where 
generative AI comes into play, as the True Positive/
False Positive decision is reflective of the specific 
set of contexts and findings for the email. One may 
argue that task\-based AI such as Bayesian tools 
could achieve the same result. However, based on 
current research our hypothesis is that generative AI 
will offer more flexibility to manage the ever\-growing 
variety of events and cases, while Bayesian tools 
have a narrower scope and diminished flexibility.

A high volume of alerts, which also contain false 
positives, forces SOC analysts to focus on reactive 
tasks and takes focus away from proactive efforts 
to improve security posture, which would result 
in fewer alerts. Previously, this loop was hard to 
break. However, the advent of a new AI\-based 
methodology to apply to incoming volume and pre
qualify which alerts may need an investigation and 
which are not likely to require one is a positive step 
forward that will allow SOC teams to allocate more 
time to proactive tasks.

Advancing global AI security

How governments and industries are advancing global AI security

AI is not new in the cybersecurity field. 
For many years it has been used to 
detect malware by using ML, but recent 
breakthrough advancements are now 
changing the depth and breadth of 
its impact.

We are now facing key questions such as: how 
to harness the power of AI to turbocharge our 
cybersecurity defenses while deterring adversaries 
from exploiting it for malicious cyber activity? Or how 
do we protect AI models against cyber threat actors?

Governments worldwide have recognized that AI 
offers both benefits and risks for society. As they 
pursue AI regulatory approaches that seek to balance 
those benefits and risks, their efforts vary in scope 
and scale. These differences among governments’ 
policy initiatives are not surprising; they reflect the 
core values of the governments’ leadership, the 
countries’ legal and constitutional frameworks, and 
the state of the technology industry and its potential 
for future growth. Despite these differences, safety 
and security are emerging as core principles pursued 
by the majority of governments as they encourage 
the safe and responsible development, deployment, 
and use of AI.

Government approaches 
to AI security 

While there is a consensus on 
the importance of security in the 
development of AI, governments 
have pursued different approaches in 
implementing security requirements.

These approaches mainly focus on the secure 
design, development, deployment, and operation 
of AI. Examples of security measures that target the 
secure design and deployment of AI systems include 
preliminary risk assessments to identify potential 
vulnerabilities and to design mitigation measures, 
adversarial testing such as red teaming to address 
unidentified vulnerabilities, and data management 
systems to guarantee quality and trusted data.

Security measures that target the secure deployment 
and operation of AI systems include mechanisms to 
protect them against misuse by users or third\-party 
attackers, such ongoing auditing and monitoring 
mechanisms, incident reporting, and automatic 
record\-keeping systems.

Advancing global AI security

The United States

The 2023 Executive Order (E.O.) 14110 on Safe, 
Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of 
Artificial Intelligence60 directs US federal agencies 
to implement the policies set forth in the E.O, 
including taking a series of actions focused on safety 
and security of AI technology. The US approach is 
notable in two ways: first, it imposed mandatory 
cybersecurity measures on federal agency use of 
AI without extending them to the private sector. 
Second, it leverages government action to enhance 
AI capabilities for cyber defense. For example, EO 
14110 directs the Department of Defense (DOD) and 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to plan and 
conduct pilot projects for how AI capabilities can aid 
in the discovery and remediation of vulnerabilities 
in critical US Government software, systems, and 
networks. The DOD has been tapped to spearhead 
actions for national security systems, while the 
DHS will spearhead actions for US Government 
civilian systems.

Furthermore, the FY24 National Defense 
Authorization Act (NDAA)61 includes several 
provisions designed to strengthen the DOD’s use 
of AI in its defense operations. Under the NDAA, 
the DOD must: develop a bug bounty program 
for foundation AI models being integrated into 
the “missions and operations” of the Department 
to strengthen cyber defense resiliency; establish a 
prize competition designed to evaluate technology 
for generative AI detection and watermarking 
to support the DOD’s warfighting requirements; 
establish and review guidance around the 
Department’s near\-term and long\-strategies for the 
adoption and use of AI; and assess the potential 
vulnerabilities of AI\-enabled military applications, 
including assessments of research and development 
efforts needed to advance AI\-enabled military 
applications. The US Government administration has 
also announced it will release a National Security 
Memorandum (NSM)62 that addresses the regulation 
of AI systems for national security, military, and 
intelligence purposes.

The European Union

Other legislative initiatives

The EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), the first 
ever horizontal legal framework on AI, requires 
providers of high\-risk AI systems and general\-
purpose AI (GPAI) models with systemic risk, to 
implement security measures. The AI Act requires 
providers of high\-risk AI systems to ensure that such 
systems achieve an appropriate level of accuracy, 
robustness, and cybersecurity, and perform 
consistently in those respects throughout their 
lifecycle. Providers of GPAI models with systemic 
risk are required to ensure an adequate level of 
cybersecurity protection of the model, as well as 
its physical infrastructure. The AI Act also requires 
providers (and deployers in some cases) of high\-
risk AI systems, and providers of GPAI models with 
systemic risk, to report serious incidents to relevant 
governmental authorities as well as relevant actors in 
the AI value chain.

Brazil and Costa Rica have proposed legislation 
that would impose on all AI systems certain 
security requirements (for example, parameters 
for separating and organizing training data; 
information security measures; human rights 
impact assessments), with additional requirements 
for high\-risk systems. Meanwhile, China has 
adopted the most stringent approach imposing 
security requirements on all covered AI systems. 
These requirements include technology ethics 
reviews; user registration and verification; measures 
to counter telecommunication network fraud; and 
the use of accurate and lawful training data.

Finally, other countries have published voluntary 
guidelines and codes of conduct that suggest 
security measures for private sector entities. 
For example, under the UK National Cyber 
Security Centre (NCSC)’s guidelines, companies 
should consider complying with measures such 
as identification of threats and risks; acquisition 
of well\-secured and well\-documented hardware 
and software; and documentation of models and 
datasets. Canada, Japan, and Singapore have 
published similar codes of conduct.

Cyber Point of View: Albania

Transparency, advanced technologies, 
and generative AI to combat malicious 
state\-sponsored cyberattacks

In July 2022, Iran launched a devastating 
cyberattack designed to cripple Albania’s digital 
infrastructure. The National Agency for Information 
Society (AKSHI), responsible for managing 
approximately 95% of the government’s digital 
services, was the biggest target.

In response, AKSHI acted decisively, stopping the 
attackers from causing additional damage and 
embarking on a journey to invest in enhancing 
its cybersecurity maturity. AKSHI partnered 
with diplomatic partners and industry leaders 
to gather intelligence and implement cutting\-
edge technologies and innovative strategies 
to protect its digital assets from ongoing and 
continuous attacks.

One of the key components in AKSHI’s success 
was transparency throughout the process and 
the swift adoption of automation, advanced 
technologies, and generative AI. This enabled 
AKSHI to fortify its defenses, boost cybersecurity 
resilience, and detect and respond to cyber threats 
more effectively. By providing real\-time insights 
and predictive analytics, AKSHI was able to stay 
ahead of the attackers.

This success story is a testament to the 
transparency, resilience, and determination of 
AKSHI’s leaders and cybersecurity professionals. 
By turning a crisis into an opportunity for growth 
and innovation, AKSHI has set a new standard for 
cybersecurity excellence and is now taking full 
advantage of generative AI capabilities to enhance 
its cybersecurity infrastructure and improve 
services for Albania’s citizens.

International standards 
for AI security 

Security vulnerabilities and risks arising from 
adversarial manipulation of AI systems can be 
exploited and impact everything from confidentiality 
to human safety. Therefore, standards are becoming 
essential to improve awareness and understanding 
of AI, address regulatory concerns and requirements, 
and extend good practice and consistency across 
the industry. Standards can also help build trust and 
confidence in AI systems among stakeholders such 
as users, customers, regulators, and society at large.

The benefits of international standards

The AI regulatory landscape is evolving almost as 
fast as AI itself. Just as there is a demand for regional 
and national standards, there are also many benefits 
to international standards.

International standards can mitigate fragmentation 
and ensure more consistency, good practice, 
controls, and even conformity assessment, especially 
where supply chains, threat actors, and applications 
are of a global nature. International standards can 
also help to facilitate cooperation, innovation, 
and competition.

ISO/IEC 42001

Under ISO/IEC 42001, organizations are guided 
in establishing continually improving risk\-based 
processes to support responsible use of AI 
throughout the AI system lifecycle.

There are also crosswalks79 available to map the NIST 
AI Risk Management Framework. Many responsible 
AI practices were born out of information security 
practices. Responsible AI red teaming is one such 
practice, where real\-world adversarial behaviors 
are emulated in an attempt to expose AI system 
vulnerabilities which can lead to harmful outputs, 
especially through prompt injection attacks. 

The requirements in ISO/IEC 42001 are intended 
to be auditable to achieve certification including 
helping to manage responsible AI across supply 
chains as well as provide a foundation that can help 
with regulatory compliance.

ISO/IEC 27090

ISO/IEC 27090 is being developed to provide 
guidance for addressing security threats to AI 
systems. The standard aims to help organizations 
better understand the consequences of security 
threats specific to AI systems throughout their 
lifecycle, such as evasion attacks, data poisoning, 
model stealing, and membership inference attacks. 
The document also describes how to detect and 
mitigate such threats. ISO/IEC 27090 starts with the 
premise that AI systems are information systems. 
Therefore, conventional cybersecurity measures–
including those in international standards such as 
ISO/IEC 27002 information security controls, and 
zero trust principles–are the foundation to mitigating 
security risks to AI systems and for securing the 
datasets associated with AI systems.

Advancing global AI security

Actionable Insights

1 Existing cybersecurity standards provide 
good practice to secure all types of 
information systems, including AI systems, 
throughout their lifecycle. As controls to 
address risks specific to AI systems mature, 
new standards will be developed. A multi\-
stakeholder approach is essential for the 
development of pragmatic and useful 
standards to help all types of organizations 
to manage security.

2 Security underpins a responsible AI 

approach; international standards can be 
used to demonstrate an overall responsible 
AI approach, accountability, and effective 
mitigation against harm and safety risks.

3 International standards can help mitigate 

fragmentation, ensure consistent 
practices globally, and facilitate trust 
and cooperation. International standards 
continue to uphold the accountability of 
trust even while regional standards are in 
demand to support regulatory frameworks.

Staying a step ahead 
of threat actors in the 
age of AI

Our experts and automated systems 
analyze and correlate across the 
thousands of threat actors we track, 
uncovering efforts to evade detection or 
expand their capabilities by leveraging 
new technologies like AI.

In February, Microsoft and OpenAI released 
publications80 discussing the emergence of nation\-
state threat actors utilizing AI for malicious purposes. 
Microsoft also released a set of policy principles 
to mitigate the risks associated with the use of 
AI tools and application programming interfaces 
(API) by nation\-state advanced persistent threats 
(APT), advanced persistent manipulators (APM), and 
cybercriminal syndicates.

To stay ahead of threat actors in the age of AI, 
Microsoft’s policy follows the principles below:

▪ 

Identification and action against malicious 
use of Microsoft AI: Upon detection of the use 
of any Microsoft AI APIs, services, or systems 
by an identified malicious actor, Microsoft 
will take appropriate action to disrupt their 
activities, for example by disabling the accounts 
used, terminating services, or limiting access 
to resources.

▪ Notification to other AI service providers: 

When we detect a threat actor’s use of another 
service provider’s AI, AI APIs, services, and/or 
systems, Microsoft will notify the service provider 
and share relevant data. This enables the provider 
to independently verify our findings and take 
action in accordance with their own policies.

▪ Collaboration with other stakeholders: 

Microsoft will collaborate with other industry and 
civil society stakeholders to regularly exchange 
information about threat actors’ use of AI. 
This collaboration aims to promote collective, 
consistent, and effective responses to ecosystem\-
wide risks.

▪ Transparency: Microsoft will inform the public 

and stakeholders about threat activity, including 
the nature and extent of threat actors’ use of AI 
detected by our systems and the measures taken 
against them, as appropriate.
