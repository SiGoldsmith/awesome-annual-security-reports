As a security professional and leader for over twenty years, I’ve witnessed the industry evolve many times over. But this time is 
different. Cybersecurity is rushing into a new frontier — one rife with opportunity and risk with the rise of generative AI. In Splunk’s 
2024 State of Security Report, we found that many CISOs and practitioners are blazing this trail without looking back. But they’re 
also not sure what’s ahead, given new compliance regulations and their impact on CISO accountability.

In today’s cyber environment, we expect security professionals to explore how generative AI can empower their resilience 
journey — and with a staggering 93% of respondents claiming adoption, many already see it as a critical point of innovation.

They’re using generative AI to build better cyber defenses, execute more informed decisions, and fill critical skills gaps. At the 
same time, at least one-third of respondents have no generative AI policies. And their biggest reported fear? AI-powered attacks.

Meanwhile, more punitive incident reporting rules by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the E.U.’s NIS2 are 
holding the CISO community to greater accountability. But we believe security professionals will also discover new opportunities 
to reshape their roles and teams. For CISOs, that means asserting priorities in the boardroom, and for security practitioners, it 
calls for tighter collaboration with ITOps, engineering, and cloud teams to expand visibility, minimize response times, and take 
resilience to new levels.

While security professionals continue to forge this new path, at Splunk we are excited about the 
potential of generative AI for defenders and encouraged by how quickly security priorities are 
becoming business priorities.

Jason Lee
Chief Information Security Officer, Splunk

The state of security in 2024 is a bit of a contradiction.

Despite the obstacles in security professionals’ 
paths — stringent compliance requirements, escalating 
geopolitical tensions, and a more sophisticated threat 
landscape — the industry is making progress.

Many organizations report that cybersecurity is 
becoming easier to manage compared to previous 
years. Organizations collaborate more and detect 
threats faster, and most have the authority and 
resources to solve the issues they face.

Complete victory remains elusive, however, as 
defenders attempt to outrun adversaries in the 
race to harness generative AI. Security teams are 
understandably concerned that generative AI will 
intensify the impact of the same attacks they’ve 
skillfully thwarted for years.

We think defenders are up to the task. The full impact 
of generative AI on cybersecurity may be unknown, but 
one thing we do know: The race is on.

## Cybersecurity is trending easier over time
Being a defender means you rarely see the fruits of your labor. It’s 
only natural to wonder: is any of this working? When it comes to 
keeping up with cybersecurity requirements, respondents were 
almost evenly split: 41% say it has become easier, while 46% find it 
more difficult.

However, the macro trends paint a hopeful picture. Since Splunk’s 
State of Security 2022, managing cybersecurity is trending easier. 
This perception may be surprising given increasing environmental 
complexity and attack sophistication. But it’s likely easier for 
organizations with well-established security controls and 
processes to stay ahead of threat actors relying on tried-and-true 
attack strategies.

Collaboration may be one reason cybersecurity is getting easier: 
87% of respondents say they are working more closely with 
other teams compared to a year ago. Three-quarters (75%) of 
respondents are joining forces more with IT operations this year. 
In addition, 54% are collaborating more with software engineering — 
and when security starts early in the design and coding phases, 
addressing vulnerabilities becomes more manageable.

Organizations are also detecting threats faster. Fifty-five 
percent of respondents estimate their mean time to detect 
(MTTD) distruption-causing incidents as 14 days or less. This 
marks a significant improvement from last year, when only 
28% of respondents estimated detection within the same 
timeframe. However, this is still too much time for attackers to 
access systems.

![Chart showing the trend of cybersecurity requirements over the past two years, with categories for "More difficult," "No more difficult," and "Easier" for 2022, 2023, and 2024.]

## But the battle isn’t over
Among those who say cybersecurity is getting more difficult, 38% 
cite threat landscape sophistication as the reason why. Geopolitical 
tensions and cyber warfare are on the rise. IoT, AI, and multicloud 
environments are increasing data volumes exponentially. And as a 
result, organizations still trying to implement basic cybersecurity 
controls will struggle to secure additional assets and endpoints. 
They’ll also have a harder time protecting against simple human 
errors, like misconfigurations, which rank as this year’s top 
threat vector.

Tighter compliance requirements also raise the stakes, particularly 
for security executives who are now personally on the hook 
for their organizations’ violations. Twenty-eight percent agree 
that regulatory compliance is making the job harder. And new 
government mandates will only ratchet up the pressure.

Similar to previous years, 27% of security teams struggle to address 
emergencies and dedicate adequate time to improve cybersecurity, 
indicating a lack of long-term strategy and investment. A barrage of 
security alerts also makes it difficult to keep up — 26% agree the 
volume is troublesome.

## AI rises above the clouds
One of the most notable findings in this year’s survey is that AI hype 
is on par with reality. Nearly half (44%) of respondents cite AI as 
among their three main initiatives in 2024, surpassing cloud security.

While security teams recognize the many benefits of AI, so do threat 
actors that are unencumbered by laws and policies. When asked 
whether AI will tip the scales in favor of defenders or adversaries, 
respondents are almost evenly divided: 45% predict adversaries will 
benefit most, while 43% say defenders will come out on top.

The meteoric rise of generative AI sparks the imagination of what 
could be, but it also raises serious questions about what will be. 
What will it mean for the SOC? Will organizations introduce policies 
to encourage safe and effective usage? How will they enforce those 
policies without hampering innovation? The answers are starting to 
take shape.

![Chart showing the top security initiatives of 2024, with AI at 44%, cloud security at 35%, and security analytics at 20%.]

## Entering the AI gold rush
During the California Gold Rush, hundreds of thousands of prospectors 
with dreams of striking it rich migrated west. Similarly, today’s 
generative AI boom involves chasing opportunity at breakneck speed 
into an unknown frontier, where the possibilities feel endless and the 
risks perilous. Everybody wants to strike the mother lode and enjoy 
first-mover advantage. It’s possible — it just takes a little digging.

## Generative AI adoption outpaces policy
![Chart showing the adoption of generative AI across the business (93%), adoption within security teams (91%), and the lack of a complete generative AI policy (34%).]

## The promise and possibility of generative AI
Generative AI has gone mainstream, and organizations are actively 
implementing it to transform their businesses. From serving 
up personalized customer recommendations in e-commerce 
to mapping the human brain to imitating the brushstrokes of 
Rembrandt, generative AI boasts an assortment of use cases in 
nearly every industry.

These aren’t mere speculations. Ninety-three percent of 
respondents report that line-of-business end users rely on public 
generative AI tools to help them do their jobs. This creates more 
work for security teams who protect the business from generative 
AI-related vulnerabilities such as data leakage.

Optimism about generative AI is powerful enough to sway even 
the most skeptical security professionals. Adoption is nearly as 
high among security teams as the overall business, with 91% of 
respondents using public generative AI. What’s more, they’re rooting 
for generative AI’s success, with 46% declaring that generative AI 
will be “game-changing” for their security teams.

The race to harness generative AI is so intense that 50% of 
respondents say their organization is in the midst of developing a 
formal plan for using generative AI for cybersecurity, but the plan 
isn’t complete or agreed upon.

Security and innovation can go hand in hand if done correctly. At the 
same time, we wonder if pressure from the business or board — or 
just good ol’ fear of missing out — is driving generative AI adoption 
among security teams.

> Just two years ago, it would’ve been almost preposterous to ask organizations 
how many end users are using public generative AI tools — but today, 
generative AI in the business is table stakes.
> — Kirsty Paine, Field CTO and Strategic Advisor for EMEA, Splunk

## Generative AI policy is uncharted territory
“Move fast and break things” might sound counterintuitive to 
most security practitioners, but it could be the right philosophy as 
organizations seek innovation at speed. And while security teams 
rarely turn down a chance to write a policy, 34% of organizations 
do not have a generative AI policy in place, despite its high 
adoption rate.

“Companies that clamp down too tightly on the use of generative 
AI risk not only falling behind their competitors, but also leaving 
themselves open to the threat actors who won’t hesitate to use 
these tools,” says Shannon Davis, principal security strategist at 
Splunk SURGe.

If we learned anything from cloud or IoT adoption, a lack of process 
and planning could come back to haunt security teams. The push 
from the business to haphazardly follow these trends resulted in 
undesirable consequences, such as non-compliant clouds paid on 
personal credit cards, or unsecured IoT devices rife with software 
vulnerabilities. Security teams must balance the speed of innovation 
with thoughtful and sustainable processes.

Robust policies depend on understanding the implications of a 
technology, yet 65% of respondents admit they lack education 
around generative AI. Teaching the rest of the organization 
about generative AI shouldn’t be the sole burden of the 
cybersecurity team, however.

> “Organizations should form a cross-functional governance board to 
oversee the development and adoption of AI with a comprehensive 
framework for responsible AI,” says Hao Yang,  
VP of AI at Splunk.

The influence of generative AI is wide-reaching, so navigating it 
calls for a range of perspectives and specializations. Splunk’s AI 
committee, for example, spans multiple business units, including 
product and technology, legal, privacy, security, human resources, 
go-to-market, and marketing.

Of course, thoughtful security policies don’t necessarily translate to 
complete prevention, but they can go a long way to minimize data 
leakage and other new vulnerabilities.

## The long arm of the law comes for generative AI
Like internal governance, the frontier of generative AI remains 
relatively untamed and unregulated by any enforceable laws —  
for now. However, AI compliance is starting to take shape.

For example, The European Union’s AI Act aims to introduce a 
common regulatory framework based on risk categories. In 2023, 
the European Parliament amended its initial proposal to include 
generative AI, which must comply with certain transparency 
requirements. These requirements include registering the 
foundation model in a database and developing and retaining 
technical documentation.

In the United States, the Biden Administration’s AI Bill of 
Rights suggests that users should be notified when they are 
communicating with an automated system, and allows to opt out 
and interact with a real person instead. These guidelines could 
foreshadow future government action.

This impending tsunami of government regulation may be why 
45% of respondents name better alignment with compliance 
requirements as a top area for improvement, right behind data 
leakage. Getting ahead of this trend requires a renewed focus on 
internal compliance controls.

> Organizations should form a cross-functional 
governance board to oversee the development 
and adoption of AI with a comprehensive 
framework for responsible AI.
> — Hao Yang, Vice President of AI, Splunk

![Chart showing the split in opinions on whether generative AI will benefit defenders or adversaries, with 45% predicting adversaries will benefit most, 43% saying defenders will benefit most, and the rest saying they will cancel each other out.]

## What generative AI use cases may look like in practice
![Chart showing the top generative AI cybersecurity use cases, with identifying risks and threat intelligence analysis at 39%, threat detection/prioritization at 35%, and summarizing security data at 34%.]

### Identifying risks
Generative AI can enhance risk-based 
alerting by quickly aggregating diverse 
datasets to provide security analysts 
with alerts that are context-rich. Large 
language models (LLMs) help to deliver this 
information at a speed and efficiency far 
beyond human capability.

### Threat intelligence analysis
LLMs can determine the indicators of 
compromise and MITRE ATT&CK techniques 
described in a threat intelligence report. 
This would save intelligence teams from a 
lot of drudgery and enable them to perform 
deeper analysis faster.

### Threat detection and prioritization
Prioritizing and triaging alerts are tasks 
particularly susceptible to analyst 
misclassification, fatigue and human errors. 
Generative AI can parallel process multiple 
threats while improving accuracy.

### Summarizing security data
Generative AI can summarize quickly, 
thoroughly and accurately to help security 
teams save time and keep up with news and 
information, like Biden’s Executive Order on 
Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.

## Generative AI as the security sidekick
Perceptions of generative AI are evolving fast. Just eight 
months ago, only 17% of respondents in our CISO report 
said generative AI would advantage defenders. Now, 
almost half (43%) feel the same way.

More and more vendors are incorporating generative 
AI into their products, demonstrating its use in security 
workflows, and defenders are starting to see the 
possibilities. While the potential for novel generative AI-
fueled attacks and AI poisoning remains a possibility, they 
have yet to become commonplace.

Defenders seem optimistic and agree that generative AI is 
a good match for several cybersecurity use cases, naming 
threat intelligence analysis and risk identification as the 
top two applications.

## Solving the cybersecurity skills shortage
Skilled professionals sit at the heart of any SOC, and many 
organizations are still coping with talent shortages. Generative AI 
could offer some breathing room to address this very real need. 
Eighty-six percent of organizations believe generative AI will help 
them hire more entry-level cybersecurity talent, and 58% say it 
would help onboard entry-level talent faster. Ninety percent of 
respondents say that entry-level staff can lean on generative AI 
to help develop their skills in the SOC once they’re hired — which 
could include fundamental tasks such as writing a Python script or 
spinning up test environments.

Generative AI will also be a force multiplier for seasoned security 
professionals. Sixty-five percent believe it will make them more 
productive, enabling experienced practitioners to more easily 
synthesize news and information, and accelerate research and 
detection engineering.

And while the fear of AI replacing jobs isn’t entirely unfounded — 
about half (49%) say generative AI will eliminate some existing 
security roles — it’s more likely to help organizations train new 
talent and prevent employee burnout. It could also simply reshuffle 
the deck of cybersecurity talent as it introduces new roles like 
prompt engineering.

![Chart showing how generative AI can close skill gaps, with 86% believing it can help organizations hire more entry-level talent and 65% believing it will allow seasoned security pros to be more productive.]

## Generative AI as the attacker’s ally
Security teams are also rightfully concerned that generative 
AI is yet another tool in the arsenals of adversaries. Forty-five 
percent of respondents believe generative AI will be a net win for 
cyber attackers, and 77% say it expands the attack surface to a 
concerning degree.

### Same attacks, different day
What unique threats will generative AI unleash upon the 
world? Odds are that instead of an immediate windfall of new 
attacks, generative AI will amplify threats already confronting 
security teams.

Thirty-two percent of respondents are most concerned about 
attackers using generative AI to optimize existing attacks, such as 
crafting more realistic phishing emails or refining malicious scripts. 
Less skilled, opportunistic hackers will exploit generative AI to 
drive a significant uplift in social engineering attacks. And 28% of 
respondents worry that generative AI will also help adversaries 
increase the volume of existing attacks.

### The enemy within
Not all AI threats originate from outside sources; 77% of 
respondents agree that more data leakage will accompany 
increased use of generative AI. However, only 49% are actively 
prioritizing data leakage prevention — possibly because there 
aren’t many solutions yet that control the flow of data in and out 
of generative AI tools.

Lack of education around generative AI only amplifies these 
concerns. When 65% of security executives admit they don’t 
fully understand generative AI, it’s fair to assume confusion 
is even higher among non-security roles. Without the proper 
education, end users are bound to make mistakes like putting 
sensitive company data into an LLM, which will place security 
teams in the crosshairs.

![Chart showing the top uses of generative AI by threat actors, with making existing attacks more effective at 32%, increasing the volume of existing attacks at 28%, creating new types of attacks at 23%, and reconnaissance at 17%.]

> It’s like the question, ‘Would you rather fight a horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses? 
It’s probably more manageable to focus on a single threat, but generative AI will create 
the less-appealing scenario, acting as a force multiplier for existing attacks.
> — Kirsty Paine, Field CTO and Strategic Advisor for EMEA, Splunk

![Chart showing that 93% of respondents say experiences with ML will influence their future approach to generative AI.]

## Mapping the future of generative AI
Where will generative AI go from here? No one has a crystal ball, but 
security teams have been embracing traditional forms of AI like machine 
learning (ML) for some time, and 93% say these experiences will influence 
their future approach to generative AI.

Many organizations have gotten a taste of the increased productivity that 
ML tools provide, with 92% receiving substantial advantages already. The 
technology is not perfect, though, and needs special care: 73% say tools 
with traditional AI and ML capabilities can generate false positives, and 
91% say they require tuning. Similarly, generative AI calls for oversight to 
spot and prevent hallucinations that can undermine its value.

Those pioneers who have already built a solid foundation with traditional 
AI and machine learning will likely find themselves on the fast track of their 
generative AI journeys.

## The building blocks of leading organizations
In the race to stay ahead of threats, some organizations follow a 
center of excellence model to build mature cybersecurity practices. 
In 2024, 47% of respondents identify their security programs as 
“extremely advanced.” We’re classifying this group as leaders and will 
be comparing their unique characteristics and survey responses with 
those of the cohort who labeled their programs as “developing.”

## Resource and empower appropriately
For starters, leaders are confident in their ability to keep up with 
the threat landscape. Forty-nine percent of leaders say managing 
cybersecurity requirements is getting easier, while only 29% of 
respondents with developing programs say the same. Leaders 
also outperform those with developing programs in several 
other aspects, painting a picture of what may be considered gold 
standard practices.

Leading organizations aren’t born; they are made. Their winning 
approach reflects a deep connection to the board and business 
stakeholders, cross-departmental collaboration and steady 
investments. Leading security teams have the budget to be 
proactive — 67% are significantly increasing cybersecurity 
spending in the next one to two years, versus 28% of respondents 
with developing programs.

A close connection to the business pays off for leading 
organizations, too. An impressive 95% say they have the resources 
and authority to address challenges, which mirrors the finding in our 
CISO Report that 47% of CISOs now report to the CEO.

## Collaborate and recognize resilience
Being connected to the business isn’t just about having the 
CEO’s ear, it requires partnering across the business. Leading 
organizations collaborate more with these tech departments:

| Collaboration with       | Leading organizations | Developing organizations |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Software engineering     | 56%                   | 46%                      |
| Engineering operations   | 51%                   | 31%                      |
| IT operations            | 76%                   | 67%                      |

Collaboration also extends to compliance. Forty-nine percent of 
leading organizations strongly agree that everyone on the security 
team makes compliance a part of their jobs, compared to just 27% 
of organizations with developing security programs.

Leading organizations recognize that there’s a lot on the line when 
it comes to digital resilience. They more strongly agree that greater 
digital resilience leads to more innovation (41%), less business 
disruption (39%), and avoiding compliance penalties (39%) — likely 
because they’re more closely connected to business outcomes.

> Without executive buy-in, achieving 
cybersecurity maturity is a losing battle.
> — Jason Lee, CISO, Splunk

## Innovate more with generative AI
Leading organizations are also more likely to innovate with AI, with 
48% declaring it as a top initiative, compared to 30% of their less 
mature peers. Generative AI adoption among their security teams 
is higher and more widespread, too — 75% of leaders say that most 
security team members were using generative AI, and only 23% of 
developing organizations say the same.

Generative AI usage among leading organizations appears to be 
less experimental and more methodical in contrast to developing 
organizations:
- 82% of leaders have established generative AI security 
policies, while only 46% of developing organizations have 
done so.
- 55% of leaders have a formal plan to use generative AI for 
cybersecurity use cases, while only 15% of developing 
organizations make this claim.

## Detect and respond to incidents faster
Cyber maturity doesn’t translate to fewer cyberattacks. However, 
leading organizations detect and respond faster than their peers, 
which softens the blow of an attack and its consequences.

For incidents that caused disruption, leading organizations 
cite a mean time to detect (MTTD) of 21 days, while developing 
organizations, on average, spend over a month (34 days) detecting 
a threat within their networks. Leading organizations also spend 
far less time in recovery mode. Their average mean time to recover 
(MTTR) business-critical workloads is just over 44 hours, while 
developing organizations’ average recovery time is 5.7 days.

> The ability to reduce detection and response 
time speaks directly to the maturity of a 
security program. That’s why MTTR and 
MTTD are such crucial metrics for boards 
and executives. They want to see measurable 
success in the long term.

## The building blocks of a leading organization
![Chart showing the key differences between leading organizations and developing organizations in four critical dimensions: resource and empower appropriately, collaborate and recognize resilience, innovate more with generative AI, and detect and respond to incidents faster.]

### Resource and empower appropriately
- **67%** of leading organizations will significantly increase cybersecurity spending in the next one to two years, compared to **28%** of developing organizations.
- **95%** of leading organizations say they have the resources and authority to address challenges, compared to **79%** of developing organizations.

### Collaborate and recognize resilience
- **51%** of leading organizations increased collaboration with engineering operations within the last year, compared to **31%** of developing organizations.
- **76%** of leading organizations increased collaboration with IT operations within the last year, compared to **67%** of developing organizations.

### Innovate more with generative AI
- **82%** of leading organizations have a generative AI security policy, compared to **46%** of developing organizations.
- **75%** of leading organizations say that most security team members are using generative AI, compared to **23%** of developing organizations.

### Detect and respond to incidents faster
- Leading organizations have an MTTD of **21 days** for disruption-causing incidents, compared to **34 days** for developing organizations.
- Leading organizations have an MTTR of **1.8 days** for business-critical workloads, compared to **5.7 days** for developing organizations.

## Sizing up the threat landscape
While security teams fight the good fight, threat actors will still find 
ways to slip past even the best defenses. The State of Security 2024 
demonstrates that attackers aren’t slowing down, with data breaches 
and ransomware
