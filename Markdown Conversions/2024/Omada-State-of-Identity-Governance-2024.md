Executive Summary
The convergence of digital transformation and the hybrid workforce 
has introduced substantial complexities into identity and access 
management procedures. These factors have emerged as primary 
catalysts for the modernization of identity governance. Consequently, 
the management of identities and their associated permissions has 
evolved into a pivotal component of cybersecurity strategies. However, 
a successful approach to identity governance must strike a balance: 
enhancing an organizations security while also facilitating business 
agility in the context of end\-user workflows. 
Identity governance is essential to enhance visibility and streamline provisioning without hindering employee 
productivity. This underscores the significance of adopting a modern approach to identity governance and 
administration (IGA). But what is a modern IGA approach? Modern identity governance solutions embrace a 
SaaS\-based model for scalability and use analytics and automation to enhance both efficiency and security. 
They automate the fine\-grained provisioning of access controls, as well as identifying and addressing over\-
provisioned and underused identities. They offer seamless connectivity to broader identity frameworks and 
business applications, and they possess the ability to effortlessly create identity workflows for all enterprise 
identities. 
To shed light on the intricate world of identity governance, we conducted a comprehensive survey involving 
567 enterprises with more than 1,000 employees across the United States, including the perspectives 
of both IT and business leaders. We surveyed people responsible for identity governance and access 
management, compliance, cybersecurity, and general IT administration and management.
Key Findings
CISOCSOCIOs are highly concerned with identity\-related threats and over\-permissioned 
account access 
Over 95% of senior IT and security leaders report grave concerns about identity\-related threats, possibly 
due to over\-permissioned access to systems and applications. In fact, 72% of respondents agreed that users 
have unnecessary access and overly permissive accounts. Organizations using legacy IGA are up to 20% 
more concerned about identity\-related threats than organizations using modern IGA. 
Enterprises are accelerating plans to leverage SaaS\-based IGA with generative AI, fast import, 
adaptability and advanced connectivity
When asked which capabilities are most important, more than 61% put adaptability to an organizations 
requirements among their top five. Of those surveyed, 53% chose generative AI. More than 42% prioritize 
the ability to handle complex identity workflows. Nearly 56% look for a connectivity framework that supports 
any application and infrastructure, and 41% choose interoperability and data sharing with all IAM tools as 
priority capabilities. In addition, 47% look for a SaaS\-based identity governance solution with faster data 
ingestion, and just over 40% prioritize the ability to synch quickly to onboard applications and enable users 
to gain access in minutes. 
Best\-of\-breed IGA wins out over platform plays
To achieve higher performance levels, a substantial majority of respondents agree (86%) that their 
organizations are more likely to choose a best\-of\-breed identity and access management (IAM) solution 
rather than a single vendor that may not offer robust capabilities across the board. This is very likely why 
more than half of respondents identified adaptability and connectivity as critical IGA solution features.

Survey Observations
The good and the bad news on identity cybersecurity threats
How concerned are organizations with cybersecurity threats? Depends on who you ask and what you ask 
them. 
When asked about security hygiene\-related practices, 93% of respondents agreed their organization uses 
strong identity verification; 92% say they can quickly identify anomalous behavior and shut down suspect 
accounts. And 91% say they can easily meet new business requirements, while 89% say they can easily 
produce regulation\-specific reports.
Given respondents extreme confidence in their security hygiene practices, one would think that their overall 
concern with identity\-related threats would be quite low. The results turned out to be far from what was 
expected: over 90% of respondents are concerned with the risks of identity\-related cybersecurity threats.
Overall, how concerned is your organization with the risks of identity\-related types 
of cybersecurity threats?
Levels of concern, however, vary somewhat based on ones role in the organization. Overall, more than 95% 
of senior managers(CISO, CSO and CIO) report they are very concerned,; yet just 87% of compliance, 
identity and access managers and 91% of cybersecurity engineers, analysts and managers share that same 
urgencyworry.

IGA vintage matters 
Fear of cybersecurity threats are higher for organizations using legacy IGA solutions. When asked about 
specific identity\-related threats, respondents using legacy and in\-house\-built IGA reported significantly 
greater concern overall. In terms of the risk level to their organizations, respondents identified malware, 
identity security breaches and vulnerability exploitation as the top threats theyre concerned about. 
Not far behind these are concerns about access to compromised accounts of users, privileged accounts and 
remote users. 
But what is quite telling is how those organizations using a modern IGA solution differed in their concern 
level. Depending on the specific threat, there is a range of 9% to 21% difference in how organizations 
respond. See the following table for a detailed breakdown of identity\-related threat concerns.

Too much access is a concern
Unnecessary access to systems and applications and overly permissive accounts are widespread concerns. 
With these heightened, it would stand to reason there would be strong controls and processes in place 
to ensure that only those who need access to applications and data have it and that access would be 
deprovisioned when it is no longer needed. However, this is only true in theory, not reality. 
Almost three\-quarters of respondents (72% ) think people in their organizations have access to systems 
and applications to which they dont need access andor have overly permissive accounts that cause 
unnecessary risk. When users have access to systems and applications they no longer need access to or have 
access that is excessive for their role, the level of impact on identity for these users is unnecessarily higher 
than it would be if their access was properly managed. Given this, its no wonder so many of them are very 
concerned about identity\-related threats.

Remote work continues to grow
Most organizations are still struggling to manage more remote worker and third\-party identities since 
the start of COVID. Organizations have 52% more employee identities, and known third parties have 
more employee identities by these amounts: partners (46%), consultants (47%), contractors (39%) and 
temporaryseasonal (35%).
This dramatic change has created security and identity challenges for IT teams across all industries. 
Uncertainty about how these different users are handled can elevate the risk of compromised accounts and 
unauthorized access through negligence, malicious insider threats, phishing and other social engineering 
tactics.

The best\-of\-breed beats platform plays
More than 76% of organizations choose best\-of\-breed IAM solutions rather than a platform. An IGA solution 
that connects with other best\-of\-breed identity and access management (IAM) solutions as part of a larger 
identity fabric enables organizations to ensure they are using the most dynamic technology across the 
board. 
Single vendors offering multiple IAM solutions as part of a platform; for example, may offer a decent option 
in one part of their identity platform but a less\-than\-ideal option in others. There are several reasons why this 
could be, from talent drain after acquiring a part of the platform to the technology not being a leader in its 
category to not being fully integrated into the platform suite the vendor offers. Also, because these vendors 
offer many solutions under one product, they tend to lack the ability to connect with other IAM solutions, 
forcing customers to use inferior technology simply to get a single part of their identity fabric that they need.
My organization tends to choose best\-of\-breed identity and access management 
solutions (e.g IGA, PAM, CIEM, DAG, ITDR, etc.) rather than a platform product from a 
single vendor that offers multiple solutions.

New IGA shopping list
Organizations want SaaS\-based IGA that offers generative AI, fast data import, adaptability, a connectivity 
framework and automation and that is security ecosystem\-friendly.
The characteristic most respondents want from a new IGA solution is adaptability to my organizations 
specific requirements. This is no surprise, given the workload that IGA solutions must contend with from the 
increasing number of business applications, complex identity workflows, role\-based provisioning and rising 
compliance requirements and how integral IGA is to the identity fabric of a typical enterprise.
Another area where respondents indicated a strong preference is Generative AI. Weve already seen many 
examples of how this transformative technology can improve efficiency and reach better outcomes. IGA is 
no exception. With Generative AI, decision\-making can happen faster, removing cumbersome processes 
and extra steps. One example is certifications. Organizations can benefit from reducing the noise of regular 
certifications and recertifications by leveraging technology to dramatically reduce certification fatigue 
and improve the quality of certifications in an IGA system. This results in not just powering compliance but 
also reducing the quantity of over\-permissioned accounts and the potential risk of a data breach if these 
accounts were ever compromised. Other features respondents would look for are a connectivity framework 
that supports any application and infrastructure, ability to handle complex identity workflows and SaaS\-
based delivery service.
