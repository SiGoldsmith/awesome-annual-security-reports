Introduction
Trust is critical to the success of every 
business. But building, scaling, and 
demonstrating trust is getting harder
for organizations. 
To meet customer expectations, security 
leaders and their teams must address 
complex threats, a growing compliance 
burden, and increasing risk from their third\-
party vendor footprint. The rapid adoption of 
AI technologies only adds to the challenge, 
requiring more oversight and governance. 
Vantas second annual State of Trust Report 
uncovers key trends across these areas of 
security, compliance, and the future of trust.
Based on a survey of 2,500 IT and business 
leaders in the U.S UK, and Australia, our 
research found that more than half (55%) of 
organizations say that security risks for their 
business have never been higher. 
But as risks increase, so do the opportunities. 
Automation and AI can significantly minimize 
the manual security and compliance tasks 
that prevent security teams from focusing 
on mission\-critical work. According to our 
research, just 11% of a companys IT budget 
isdedicated to securitybut in an ideal 
world, leaders say it should be 17%.
This is where automation and AI can play a 
transformative role in unlocking efficiencies 
for security teams and ultimately, business 
value for organizations.

The state of trust today
The security landscapecompounded by 
third\-party risk and AIhas never been 
more challenging
Cybersecurity threats are the number one concern for 
businesses in 2024, higher than financial and operational risk. 
And more than half (55%) of organizations say that security risks 
have never been higher, with 50% of organizations detecting 
and responding to cybersecurity threats at least once a week. 
Further complicating security is vendor riskalmost half (46%) 
of organizations say that a vendor of theirs has experienced a 
data breach since they started working together.
At the same time, more than half (51%) of organizations have 
concerns around the use of AI and the risks it poses for the 
security of the organization.

Security budgets and investment are 
not where leaders think they should be, 
especially in larger organizations
D
espite increasing security risks, just 11% of a companys 
IT budget is dedicated to securitybut in an ideal world, 
leaders say it should be 17%. 
The larger the organization, the more of its IT budget 
is spent on security. However, for organizations with 
over 1,000 employees, leaders say that 21% of their 
organizations security budget would ideally be dedicated 
to security when it is currently just 12%. 
Compounding this challenge is the fact that over 1in10 
(11%) organizations have decreased their investment in 
hiring cybersecurity staffan ongoing consequence of a 
tough economy, budget constraints, and talent shortages.
While threats are increasing, businesses are also facing 
growing security expectations. Nearly two\-thirds (65%) of 
organizations say that customers, investors, and suppliers 
are increasingly requiring proof of compliance. To establish 
and deepen trust with customers, businesses need to 
prioritize security resourcing.

Security doesnt need to be complex. 
It needs to scale the business, be a 
business enabler, and it needs to be 
there at the very beginning. Without it, 
its only a matter of time before theres 
a serious issue.

of organizations plan to 
invest more in AI security 
in the next 12 months
At the same time that AI is becoming 
increasingly common in the tech stack, 
security concerns are also on the rise. A 
majority (62%) of businesses plan to invest 
more in security around the use of AI 
within their organization in the next year. 
And over the last 18 months, cyber risks 
and threats have gone up, with businesses 
experiencing more phishing attacks (33%), 
a rise in AI\-based malware (32%), and more 
compliance violations (27%). 
Building trust in AI
AI governance and risk management, 
however, are still relatively nascent. Only 2 in 
5 (37%) organizations currently conduct, or 
are in the process of conducting, regular AI 
risk assessments. When it comes to formal 
policies for governing AI usage, only 36% of 
organizations have, or are in the process of 
putting, a company AI policy in place despite 
the increased use of AI tools. This rises as 
high as 42% in the UK, but falls as low as 28% 
in Australia.

Protecting customer trust in a AI world
Building and maintaining trust is even more critical as organizations 
accelerate their usage of AI to develop and deliver new products. This 
means committing to safe and ethical AI practices and prioritizing 
transparency, particularly when it comes to training AI models. 
Almost one\-third of organizations (31%) use a mix of customer 
and synthetic data to train AI models, while 27% use anonymized 
customer data. Further, while 25% of organizations require opt\-in from 
customers to use their data for AI training, over 75% of companies 
dont offer an opt\-out option.
While the future of AI is far from set, organizations can maintain
trust by giving customers control over their data through an informed 
consent model. This vigilance should extend to third parties too,
and companies should require a formal data processing agreement 
(DPA) stipulating that vendors not use customer data to train their
AI models.
Being an AI company 
requires us to build an 
even deeper level of trust 
because this technology 
is largely unknown.
We need our customers 
to see us as a trusted 
partner to help them 
implement this.

How budgets impact the frequency of security activities
There is also a significant gap in the frequency of foundational 
security activities depending on whether organizations have a 
dedicated security budget.
State of Trust Report 2024

The scale of activities required for compliance is extensive. 
But with automation, security professionals could save 10% 
ofthe working week. In 2024, organizations estimate that 
they could save more time through automation than they 
didin 2023\.
Automation is of growing importance to security teams, 
with 44% of organizations saying that their investment in 
automation for security operations has increased over the 
past year. And 6 in 10 (59%) say that automating manual 
workis a priority for their security and compliance strategy. 
On average, security teams could save between 3\-5 
hours a week by automating activities like user access 
reviews, employee management, and answering security 
questionnairesallowing them to focus on strategic
security initiatives.
While 72% of IT decision makers say that their company 
could save time and money through automation, just 57% 
ofbusiness decision makers say the same. Leaders from the 
frontlines of security can help bridge this gap by getting
buy\-in for automation that reduces time\-consuming 
processes. Automation not only benefits the business but 
also improves employee wellbeing, with 39% of respondents 
agreeing that good security practices bring peace of mind.

Trust and third\-party risk
Third\-party risk increases as companies scale
Managing vendor risk is a challenge for any business, and this only 
becomes more difficult as a company scales. The larger the business,
the more vendors they haveand the bigger the associated risk.
At the same time, less than a quarter (24%) of organizations rate their 
visibility into vendor risk as very strong. With almost half (48%) of 
organizations saying that a vendor they work with has previously 
experienced a breach, businesses need to implement a proactive 
approach that reduces risk and enables continuous visibility into their 
third\-party landscape.

Confidence in vendor compliance is high,
but third\-party breaches undermine overall 
security and trust 
The majority of organizations (69%) feel confident that their vendors 
comply with relevant industry standards and regulations. But breaches 
are still prevalent, and regardless of their security maturity, 46% of 
businesses say that a vendor of theirs has had a data breach since 
they started working with them or using their products. 
These types of breaches have a serious impact on customer trust, 
with 62% agreeing that third\-party breaches negatively impact their 
organizations reputation. One in two (50%) businesses say theyve 
terminated a vendor relationship due to security concerns.
To maintain and scale trustboth across their own organizations 
and their third\-party vendorsforward\-thinking leaders need to go 
beyond the standard of point\-in\-time checks towards a holistic and 
continuous approach to monitoring.

AI can transform vendor risk management 
and security reviews 
On average, organizations spend 6 hours per working weekthe 
equivalent of 7 working weeks a yearon vendor security reviews 
and risk assessments. But organizations now see even more 
potential in AI to streamline vendor risk reviews and onboarding 
than they did last yearup from 35% in 2023 to 42% in 2024\. 
IT and business leaders say the most transformative areas for 
AI are improving the accuracy of security questionnaires (43%), 
streamlining vendor risk reviews and onboarding (42%), eliminating 
manual work (38%), and reducing the need for large teams (30%).

1\. Demonstrating trust continues
to drive business value 
As the security expectations of customers grow, leaders continue to 
recognize the business value of investing in securityand demonstrating 
it. Close to two\-thirds (65%) of organizations say that customers, 
investors, and suppliers increasingly require demonstration of compliance. 
Nearly half (48%) of organizations believe good security practices drive 
customer trust for their business (up 7% from last year), and 46% recognize 
that good security practices lead to reduced financial risks.

are confident in their teams ability to 
show the impact of their security program 
on the business. Further, 9 in 10 (89%) 
quantify and measure the impact of their 
program in some capacity.
The top three ways that organizations 
measure impact are: compliance and 
audit outcomes, operational efficiency, 
and risk reduction. 
While teams are quantifying and measuring 
impact, only 36% are measuring actual ROI. 
And even fewer are tracking the security

For organizations of all sizes, building and 
scaling trust is difficult. With more reliance 
on third\-party vendors and increased use of 
AI technologies, security leaders face a more 
complex threat landscape while managing 
resource constraints.
But the tools available today only make this 
work more challenging. Teams are stuck with 
screenshots and spreadsheets or legacy 
solutions that rely on manual updates and 
only provide point\-in\-time visibility into their 
securityposture. 
To keep pace with where the future of trust is 
headed, security leaders need to go beyond the 
standard way of doing things. They need to make 
trust continuous, collaborative, and automated 
across every part of their business. With trust 
management, organizations can not only reduce 
risk, but also build customer confidence and 
accelerate revenue growth.
Conclusion: 
Go beyond the 
standard with 
trustmanagement
Build a trust program powered by automation
The tools you use to manage your trust program 
should help rather than hold you back. Implement trust 
management platforms that automate key workflows, 
continuously monitor your security and compliance, 
and provide centralized visibility and insights across 
your program. 
Demonstrate trust in real time
Go beyond point\-in\-time compliance certifications 
and create opportunities to proactively demonstrate 
and maintain trust with customers. This looks like 
showcasing your security controls through a public 
Trust Center and instantly and accurately responding 
to security questionnaires with the help of AI.
Strengthen your entire trust network
Trust isnt just a reflection of your organization. It also 
reflects your network of vendors and partners. Raise 
the bar by establishing your own standard for trust in 
your organization. Create custom controls based on 
your definition of what good security looks like for 
those that do business with you to strengthen trust 
across your ecosystem.
