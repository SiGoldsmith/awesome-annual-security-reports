Methodology 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Intelligence Enterprise Homeland Threat Assessment reflects 
the insights from across the Department, the Intelligence Community, and other critical homeland security 
stakeholders. It focuses on the most direct, pressing threats to our Homeland during the next year and is 
organized into four sections. We organized this assessment around the Department’s missions that most closely 
align or apply to these threats—public safety, border and immigration, critical infrastructure, and economic 
security. As such, many of the threat actors and their efforts cut across mission areas and interact in complex 
and, at times, reinforcing ways. 

Going forward, the annual Homeland Threat Assessment will serve as the primary regular mechanism for 
articulating and describing the prevailing terrorism threat level, which has previously been done through our 
issuance of National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) bulletins. In the future, the issuance of NTAS bulletins 
will be reserved for situations where we need to alert the public about a specific or imminent terrorist threat or 
about a change in the terrorism threat level. 
iv 
Homeland Threat Assessment 2024 

Executive Summary 
Terrorism, both foreign and domestic, remains a top threat to the Homeland, but other threats are increasingly 
crowding the threat space. During the next year, we assess that the threat of violence from individuals radicalized 
in the United States will remain high, but largely unchanged, marked by lone offenders or small group attacks 
that occur with little warning. Foreign terrorist groups like al-Qa’ida and ISIS are seeking to rebuild overseas, and 
they maintain worldwide networks of supporters that could seek to target the Homeland. 

In addition to the enduring terrorism threat, we expect illegal drugs produced in Mexico and sold in the United 
States will continue to kill more Americans than any other threat. During the past year, US-based traffickers have 
become more involved in the mixing and pressing of fentanyl, contributing to more lethal mixes of this already 
deadly drug. 

This year, record encounters of migrants arriving from a growing number of countries have complicated border 
and immigration security. While monthly encounters have fallen from record highs in December, overall 
encounters for the fiscal year are on pace to nearly match 2022’s record high total. As part of the overall increase 
in migration, we have also encountered a growing number of individuals in the Terrorist Screening Data Set 
(TSDS), also known as the “watchlist.” Inclusion in the TSDS ranges from known associates of watchlisted 
individuals, such as family members, to individuals directly engaged in terrorist activity. 

Domestic and foreign adversaries will likely continue to target our critical infrastructure over the next year, in 
part because they perceive targeting these sectors would be detrimental to US industries and the American way 
of life. While cyber attacks seeking to compromise networks or disrupt services for geopolitical or financial 
purposes continue apace, we noted an uptick over the last year of physical attacks on critical infrastructure. 

We expect the 2024 election cycle will be a key event for possible violence and foreign influence targeting our 
election infrastructure, processes, and personnel. 

Against this backdrop of traditional homeland security threats, we expect the People’s Republic of China (PRC) 
will continue to use predatory economic practices to advantage its firms and industries over ours. The PRC will 
likely continue to manipulate markets, employ economic espionage and coercive economic tools, and seek to 
illicitly acquire our technologies and intellectual property. Concurrently, financially motivated criminal actors 
are adapting new methods to improve their ability to financially extort victims and will likely continue to 
impose significant financial costs on the US economy over the next year. 

Climate change, natural disasters, and technological advances have the potential to compound many of these 
threats. Climate-related disasters, such as heat waves, droughts, wildfires, coastal storms, and inland flooding, 
have the potential to disrupt regional economies, foster health crises like disease outbreaks, and tax law 
enforcement resources. Meanwhile, the proliferation of accessible artificial intelligence (AI) tools likely will 
bolster our adversaries’ tactics. Nation-states seeking to undermine trust in our government institutions, social 
cohesion, and democratic processes are using AI to create more believable mis-, dis-, and malinformation 
campaigns, while cyber actors use AI to develop new tools and accesses that allow them to compromise more 
victims and enable larger-scale, faster, efficient, and more evasive cyber attacks.

# PUBLIC SAFETY AND SECURITY 
## OVERVIEW 
One of the Department’s top priorities is to ensure the safety and security of the 
American people. Within the Public Safety and Security mission, we considered 
lethal threats in the Homeland, including terrorism and illegal drugs, as well as 
nation-state efforts to malignly influence US audiences, as the primary national 
security threats to our communities. 

The terrorism landscape in the United States has evolved since 9/11—from foreign terrorists 
directing attacks in the Homeland to a more amorphous threat environment where individuals or 
small cells independently plot attacks to advance a range of ideologies and political objectives. 
Meanwhile, the production, trafficking, and sale of illegal drugs by transnational and domestic 
criminal actors probably pose the most lethal and persistent threat to communities in the United 
States. Nation-state adversaries intent on undermining our social cohesion are incorporating 
new technologies into their mis-, dis-, and malinformation campaigns, which will likely ramp up 
ahead of the elections this year (see “Threat Actors Likely To Converge on 2024 Election Season,” 
page 19). Many of these same actors seek to suppress dissidents living in the United States, 
violating our sovereignty and the rule of law.

# TERRORISM 
In 2024, we expect the threat of violence from violent extremists radicalized in the United States 
will remain high but largely unchanged from the threat as described in the May 2023 National 
Threat Advisory System (NTAS) bulletin. Over the past year, both domestic violent extremists 
(DVEs) and homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) inspired by foreign terrorist organizations have 
engaged in violence in reaction to sociopolitical events. These actors will continue to be inspired 
and motivated by a mix of conspiracy theories; personalized grievances; and enduring racial, 
ethnic, religious, and anti-government ideologies, often shared online. 
- Since January 2022, DVEs have conducted three fatal attacks in the Homeland resulting in 21 
deaths and multiple non-lethal attacks. US law enforcement has disrupted over a half dozen 
other DVE plots. During the same period, only one attack was conducted by an individual 
inspired by a foreign terrorist organization. The individual—who is awaiting trial—was likely 
inspired by a spiritual mentor of al-Qa‘ida and Taliban narratives and allegedly wounded three 
New York City Police Department officers on New Year’s Eve. 
- Collectively, these incidents focused on a variety of targets, including law enforcement, 
government, faith-based organizations, retail locations, ethnic and religious minorities, 
healthcare infrastructure, transportation, and the energy sector. The most lethal attack this 
year occurred in May in Allen, Texas, where a now-deceased attacker killed eight people at 
a shopping mall. The attacker was fixated on mass violence and held views consistent with 
racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist (RMVE) and involuntary celibate violent 
extremist ideologies, judging from his writings and online activities. 
- While violent extremists likely will continue using accessible, easy-to-use weapons for attacks, 
they also will leverage online platforms and encrypted communications applications to share 
novel tactics and techniques. Collaboration among violent extremists online likely will grow 
as they strive to spread their views, recruit followers, and inspire attacks. Some RMVEs have 
improved the quality of their video and magazine publications online, which could help them 
inspire more like-minded individuals to commit attacks. 

Foreign terrorist groups like al-Qa‘ida and ISIS are seeking to rebuild overseas, and they maintain 
worldwide networks of supporters that could seek to target the Homeland. Among state actors, we 
expect Iran to remain the primary sponsor of terrorism and continue its efforts to advance plots 
against individuals in the United States. 
- Foreign terrorists continue to engage with supporters online to solicit funds, create and share 
media, and encourage attacks while their affiliates in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East prioritize 
local goals. Since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, ISIS’s regional branch—ISIS‑Khorasan— 
has garnered more prominence through a spate of high-casualty attacks overseas and 
English‑language media releases that aim to globalize the group’s local grievances among 
Western audiences. Individuals with terrorism connections are interested in using established 
travel routes and permissive environments to facilitate access to the United States.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
- Iran maintains its intent to plot attacks against current and former US government officials 
in retaliation for the 2020 death of Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps-Qods Force (IRGC­
QF) Commander and designated foreign terrorist Qassem Soleimani. Iran relies on individuals 
with pre-existing access to the United States for surveillance and lethal plotting—using dual 
nationals, members of criminal networks, and private investigators—and has attempted plots 
that do not require international travel for operatives. In August 2022, the DOJ indicted an 
IRGC-QF member for allegedly conspiring to assassinate a former US National Security Advisor 
between late 2021 to mid‑2022. Iran’s surrogate Lebanese Hizballah also called for revenge 
against the United States for Soleimani’s death. 

# ILLEGAL DRUGS 
While terrorists pose an enduring threat to the Homeland, drugs kill and harm far more people 
in the United States annually. The increased supply of fentanyl and variations in its production 
during the last year have increased the lethality of an already deadly drug, a trend likely to persist 
in 2024. Traffickers in Mexico and the United States are using various additives, such as xylazine, 
and mixing fentanyl into counterfeit prescription pills, which are driving an increase in overdoses. 
Given this trend, we expect fentanyl to remain the leading cause of narcotics-related deaths in 
the United States. The illegal narcotics trade also harms our communities by supporting violent 
criminal enterprises, money laundering, and corruption that undermines the rule of law. 
- Seizures of fentanyl at our southern border continue to increase throughout 2023 with CBP 
on track to seize a record amount of fentanyl entering the United States (see Figure 1). CBP 
seizures of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine have either remained steady or declined 
each fiscal year since 2020. However, US law enforcement is increasingly encountering 
instances where many of these drugs are mixed with fentanyl. Preliminary data from the 
4 
Homeland Threat Assessment 2024 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that more than 100,000 individuals have 
died from drug overdoses in the United States during the last year, continuing the previous 
year’s trend. Synthetic opioids, including drugs such as fentanyl and tramadol, have accounted 
for roughly 75 percent of overdoses during the last year. 
- Domestic drug traffickers have gained more influence over the composition of fentanyl pills 
available in the United States and have distributed potentially more deadly mixtures of the drug 
to both witting and unwitting users. US law enforcement seizures of pill presses purchased 
online have increased, suggesting these US‑based traffickers are pressing a highly toxic 
combination of drugs into different types of pills. Fentanyl has appeared more frequently in 
counterfeit prescription pills, such as Adderall and Xanax, combinations that raise the risk of 
overdose, particularly for unwitting users. Traffickers are also bulking fentanyl powder and pills 
with the animal sedative xylazine (“Tranq”), challenging standard opioid overdose treatments.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
- Transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) in Mexico, particularly the Sinaloa Cartel and the 
New Generation Jalisco Cartel, remain the primary smugglers of fentanyl and other drugs into 
the United States.[^1] These organizations continue to use bribery and violence to grow their 
smuggling and narcotics production operations in Mexico, and they rely on companies in China 
to purchase fentanyl precursor chemicals and pill pressing equipment. 

[^1]: Transnational criminal organizations refers to those self-perpetuating associations of individuals who operate transnationally for the 
purpose of obtaining power, influence, monetary and/or commercial gains, wholly or in part by illegal means, while protecting their activities 
through a pattern of corruption and/or violence, or while protecting their illegal activities through a transnational organizational structure and 
the exploitation of transnational commerce or communication mechanisms. 

# FOREIGN MISINFORMATION, DISINFORMATION, AND MALINFORMATION[^2]
Nation-state adversaries likely will continue to spread mis-, dis-, and malinformation aimed at 
undermining trust in government institutions, our social cohesion, and democratic processes. 
The proliferation and accessibility of emergent cyber and AI tools probably will help these actors 
bolster their malign information campaigns by enabling the creation of low-cost, synthetic text-, 
image-, and audio-based content with higher quality. Russia, China, and Iran continue to develop 
the most sophisticated malign influence campaigns online. Many of the tactics these adversaries 
use to influence US audiences will likely be used in the lead‑up to the 2024 election (for more 
information on threats to elections see page 19). 
- Generative AI enables the rapid creation of an endless supply of higher quality, more 
idiomatically correct text, providing influence actors the ability to expand their messaging 
and give it a greater aura of credibility. Already, hundreds of websites have used a publicly 
available, large-language, model-based chatbot to generate content, some of which was false or 
misleading. For example, in April, a Chinese government-controlled news site using a generative 
AI platform pushed a previously circulated false claim that the United States was running a lab 
in Kazakhstan to create biological weapons for use against China. Recently, Russian influence 
actors have used new AI technology in select cases to augment their operations. For instance, 
in June, an RT (formerly Russia Today) social media account created and shared a deepfake 
AI-generated video disparaging the US President and other Western leaders. 
- Russia likely will continue to use traditional media, covert websites, social networks, online 
bots, trolls, and individuals to amplify pro‑Kremlin narratives and conduct influence activities 
within the United States. Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russian messaging has focused on 
justifying its aggression, seeking to reduce US domestic support for Kyiv, and encouraging 
divisions among the diverse set of global partners that are helping Ukraine. 

[^2]: Misinformation is false, inaccurate, or misleading information that is spread regardless of the intent to deceive. An adversary’s intent can 
change misinformation to disinformation. Disinformation is false or misleading information that is deliberately created or spread with the 
intent to deceive or mislead. Malinformation is an adversary’s deliberate use of otherwise verifiable information with malicious intent, such 
as by amplifying the information selectively or out of context, or to the detriment of specific persons. 
6 
Homeland Threat Assessment 2024 
- China has used state and proxy media for overt messaging and coordinated, inauthentic social 
media campaigns to influence US audiences—activities we expect to continue. Its influence 
actors likely will continue their efforts to refine and employ tactics and messaging to influence 
US discourse. Iran will likely also attempt to influence US audiences to promote its anti‑US 
agenda utilizing social media and inauthentic websites. 

# TRANSNATIONAL REPRESSION 
To augment many of their efforts in the public sphere, China, Iran, and Russia likely will continue 
to pursue transnational repression activity in the Homeland, undermining US laws, norms, and 
individuals’ rights. Adversaries have targeted individuals in the United States who they perceive 
as threats to their legitimacy, including ethnic and religious minorities, political dissidents, and 
journalists. Agents of these regimes use physical assault, threats, harassment and defamation, 
rendition, and the manipulation of international law enforcement personnel and processes to 
suppress oppositional voices. China and Iran likely will remain the most aggressive actors in the 
United States. 
- China is likely to continue its efforts to suppress the activities of dissidents in the United 
States, including members of the Chinese diaspora and Chinese students at US universities. 
Beijing also has used a small number of secret, unsanctioned “police stations” in the United 
States to identify, monitor, and harass dissidents. Its global “Operation Fox Hunt” has sought 
the extradition of Chinese dissidents under false legal pretenses. 
- Iran has targeted Iranian dissidents in the United States to suppress support for potential 
anti-regime protests and calls for social and political reform. In early 2023, the DOJ indicted 
several individuals for plotting to murder a US dissident on behalf of Iran. Tehran had previously 
subjected the US citizen to death threats, a year-long social media campaign calling for their 
abduction, and the arrest of a family member in Iran. 
- Iranian and Chinese intelligence services have hired US-based private investigators to monitor 
dissidents, suggesting US citizens may wittingly or unwittingly enable activities that result 
in harassment or physical harm to individuals in the United States. Similarly, in at least one 
instance, Russia has used a foreign national to spy on a US-based Russian dissident.

## Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Threats Endure 
Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats to the Homeland will persist 
into 2024 due to several factors, including foreign political and military developments 
and the global proliferation of laboratories working with dangerous biological pathogens. 
However, the deliberate use of such threats against the Homeland will likely be limited. 
Over the past year, Russia’s public allusions to using nuclear weapons as part of its 
invasion of Ukraine demonstrate that international actors still consider nuclear threats 
as viable tools of statecraft. Meanwhile, the growing nexus between AI and scientific 
research—especially in biotech—raises the potential for deliberate and incidental creation 
of novel chemical compounds that can risk public health. While CBRN threats occurring 
abroad may not reach the Homeland, they have the potential to disrupt regional and global 
commerce, harming US economic interests.

Homeland Threat Assessment 2024 

# BORDER AND IMMIGRATION SECURITY 
## OVERVIEW 
The Department ensures the safety and security of our borders while managing 
safe, orderly, and humane immigration, travel, and trade systems. Within this 
section, we considered the threats posed by transnational criminal organizations, 
terrorists, and other threat actors seeking to exploit our border, as well as 
migration trends that complicate our ability to identify and interdict these threats. 

The complex border and immigration security challenges we have faced over the last year are likely 
to continue. Although encounters with migrants have declined from record highs in December, 
migrants seeking entry to the United States are still arriving at a rate that is on pace to nearly 
match 2022 total encounters. As part of this increase, we have encountered growing numbers of 
individuals in the Terrorist Screening Data Set (TSDS), also known as the “watchlist.”[^3] Also, TCOs 
continue to exploit this complex environment to smuggle deadly drugs across our borders, often 
through ports of entry, and to extort and mislead migrants seeking to enter the United States. 

[^3]: The Terrorist Screening Dataset (TSDS)—also known as the “watchlist”—is the U.S. government’s database that contains sensitive 
information on terrorist identities. The TSDS originated as the consolidated terrorist watchlist to house information on known or suspected 
terrorists (KSTs) but has evolved over the last decade to include additional individuals who represent a potential threat to the United States, 
including known associates of watchlisted individuals

U.S. Department of Homeland Security 

# MIGRATION AND WATCHLIST ENCOUNTER TRENDS 
Record numbers of migrants traveling from a growing number of countries have been encountered 
at our borders this fiscal year, with some monthly decreases largely attributed to migrants 
exploring new legal pathways or the expressed fear of penalties for irregularly crossing following 
the lifting of the Title 42 Public Health Order. We expect continued high numbers of migrant 
encounters over the next year because traditional drivers of migration to the United States remain 
unchanged and frustration with waiting for legal migration pathways may grow. Terrorists and 
criminal actors may exploit the elevated flow and increasingly complex security environment to 
enter the United States. 
- CBP is on pace to encounter more migrants at the southern border this year than any other year 
except 2022 (see Figure 2), with encounters spiking just prior to the January announcement 
of expanded parole processes for migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. 
Encounters spiked again just prior to the lifting of the Title 42 Public Health Order in May, as 
some migrants rushed to enter the United States prior to the change. While our southern border 
remains the primary vector for migration, migrant encounters along the northern border have 
reached record highs, with over 132,000 migrants through June, compared with nearly 68,000 
migrants the same time last fiscal year. Overall maritime migration encounters in FY 2023 
are down compared to FY 2022. Maritime migration encounters in the Caribbean, primarily of 
Cuban and Haitian nationals, peaked in January, reaching a high of 5,677 migrants. 
- Increased migration from the Eastern Hemisphere has exacerbated border security challenges 
in FY 2023, partly because many of these migrants require additional processing and 
repatriation resources. Encounters of migrants from the Eastern Hemisphere doubled from 
over 110,000 in FY 2022 to over 228,200 through June 2023. We expect the influx of these 
migrants will continue as they face poor economic, political, security, and climate conditions in 
their countries and use uneven visa policies across the globe to reach the United States. 
- Individuals with potential terrorism connections continue to attempt to enter the Homeland. As 
of July, approximately 160 non-US persons in the TSDS attempted to enter the United States 
via the southern border this year, most of whom were encountered attempting to illegally enter 
between ports of entry. This represents an increase from the approximately 100 encounters in 
all of FY 2022. Inclusion in the TSDS ranges from known associates of watchlisted individuals, 
such as family members, to individuals directly engaged in terrorist activity.

# TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS 
TCOs almost certainly will continue to smuggle drugs into our country while also exploiting 
migrants for financial gain. These criminal organizations likely will seek new technologies and 
develop novel techniques to improve their ability to evade our border security measures. 
- Mexico-based TCOs, including human smuggling organizations, are leveraging small unmanned 
aerial systems (UAS) to enhance and protect their operations. In 2022 and 2023, US officials 
observed human smugglers using commercially available UAS to monitor migrants and law 
enforcement across the border. Drug traffickers also use small commercial UAS to augment 
drug smuggling and to surveil US and Mexican law enforcement activities, helping them avoid 
some interdiction operations. 

## Human Trafficking 
Human trafficking—specifically transnational sex trafficking and forced labor—is an 
enduring threat to human and workers’ rights, our economic interests and labor markets, 
physical and virtual borders, immigration and customs systems, and the national security 
of the United States.[^4] While we lack reliable statistics on the prevalence of human 
trafficking, more than 10,000 trafficking situations with over 16,000 likely victims of 
trafficking were reported to the National Human Trafficking Hotline in 2021, the most 
recent year for which data is available. 
- Transnational sex trafficking in the United States continues to primarily involve illicit 
massage businesses and private brothels that exploit women predominantly from Asia. 
Mexico‑based criminal networks are also involved in sex trafficking, coercing Mexican 
women and girls into commercial sex across several US jurisdictions, according to ICE. 
Sex traffickers often use social media, dating sites, chat rooms, and other web sites to 
identify, groom, and recruit victims and advertise victims to prospective customers. 
- Criminals involved in forced labor operations have used coercive schemes that exploit 
vulnerabilities in US visa programs and immigration systems, demonstrating the need 
for continued cross-agency coordination to mitigate these threats. Imported goods 
produced with forced labor remain a persistent issue and present several risks for the 
public, corporate, government, and military supply chains, ranging from food safety and 
intellectual property to national security, according to CBP.[^5] 

[^4]: Human trafficking involves exploiting individuals for the purposes of forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation. It is common for those 
who are willingly smuggled into the United States to then become victims of human trafficking. 
[^5]: US law prohibits the importation of goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part from forced labor.

# CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY 
## OVERVIEW 
Critical infrastructure provides the goods and services that are the backbone of 
our national and economic security and the well-being of all Americans. Within 
this section, we considered physical and cyber threats from domestic and foreign 
actors—including terrorists, adversarial nation-states, and non-state actors—to 
the resources, assets, and structures of our critical infrastructure sectors. 

Domestic and foreign adversaries likely will continue to threaten the integrity of US critical 
infrastructure—including the transportation sector—over the next year, in part because they 
perceive targeting these sectors would have cascading impacts on US industries and the 
American way of life. From attacks aimed at disrupting services to espionage focused on gaining 
access to networks and stealing sensitive information, these actors are constantly adapting their 
techniques to gain access to and potentially compromise these entities. DVEs increasingly called 
for physical attacks on critical infrastructure this year, while foreign adversaries are exploring new 
technologies like AI to improve their tactics. 
17 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security 

# DISRUPTIVE AND DESTRUCTIVE ATTACKS 
DVEs and criminal actors with unclear motivations are increasingly calling for and carrying out 
physical attacks against critical infrastructure, particularly the energy sector. DVEs see such 
attacks as a means to advance their ideologies and achieve their sociopolitical goals. 
- DVEs, particularly RMVEs promoting accelerationism—an ideology that seeks to destabilize 
society and trigger a race war—have encouraged mobilization against lifeline and other critical 
functions, including attacks against the energy, communications, and public health sectors. 
Unidentified actors have attacked electric cooling components, substations, and transformers, 
though the impact on the energy sector’s ability to provide localized services has been minimal. 

State and non-state cyber actors continue to seek opportunistic access to critical infrastructure 
sector targets for disruptive and destructive attacks. Common tactics include denial-of-
service, website defacement, and ransomware. Some of these actors also seek to develop or 
improve existing capabilities that can disrupt industrial control systems that support US energy, 
transportation, healthcare, and election sectors. 
- Malicious cyber activity targeting the United States has increased since the beginning of the 
Russia‑Ukraine conflict, a trend we expect to continue throughout the duration of the conflict. 
Pro‑Russia cyber criminal groups, such as Killnet, collaborate to conduct distributed denial‑of‑
service (DDoS) attacks and other potentially disruptive attacks against US government systems 
and our transportation and healthcare sectors. Killnet claimed credit for a March 2022 DDoS 
attack against a US airport it believed was helping US efforts to aid Ukraine. 
- Malicious cyber actors have begun testing the capabilities of AI-developed malware and 
AI-assisted software development—technologies that have the potential to enable larger scale, 
faster, efficient, and more evasive cyber attacks—against targets, including pipelines, railways, 
and other US critical infrastructure. Adversarial governments, most notably the PRC, are 
developing other AI technologies that could undermine US cyber defenses, including generative 
AI programs that support malicious activity such as malware attacks. 
- The increased use of Smart City technologies—including big data, cloud computing, and 
sensors that inform city operations—creates new attack opportunities for adversarial state 
and non-state cyber actors to gain access to or carry out disruptive attacks against local 
government and critical infrastructure networks. 
- In recent years, ransomware incidents have become increasingly prevalent among US state, 
local, tribal, and territorial governments and critical infrastructure entities, disrupting services. 
K‑12 school districts have been a near constant ransomware target due to school systems’ IT 
budget constraints and lack of dedicated resources, as well as ransomware actors’ success 
at extracting payment from some schools that are required to function within certain dates 
and hours.

Homeland Threat Assessment 2024 

## Threat Actors Likely To Converge on 2024 Election Season 
Our electoral processes remain an attractive target for many adversaries, and we 
expect many of them will seek to influence or interfere with the 2024 election. Some 
DVEs may attempt to disrupt civic and democratic processes, mobilized by their 
perceptions of the upcoming election cycle. Nation-state threat actors likely will seek 
to use novel technologies and cyber tools to enhance their capabilities and malign 
influence campaigns, ultimately to undermine our confidence in a free and fair election. 
Cyber actors likely will seek to exploit election-related networks and data, including 
state, local, and political parties’ networks and election officials’ personal devices and 
e-mail accounts. 
- Some DVEs, particularly those motivated by conspiracy theories and anti-government 
or partisan grievances, may seek to disrupt electoral processes. Violence or threats 
could be directed at government officials, voters, and elections‑related personnel and 
infrastructure, including polling places, ballot drop box locations, voter registration sites, 
campaign events, political party offices, and vote counting sites. 
- Russia, China, and Iran likely see the upcoming election season in 2024 as an 
opportunity to conduct overt and covert influence campaigns aimed at shaping 
favorable US policy outcomes and undermining US stability, and they will likely ramp 
up these efforts in advance of the election. These adversarial states are likely to use 
AI technologies to improve the quality and breadth of their influence operations targeting 
US audiences (see “Foreign Misinformation, Disinformation, and Malinformation” for 
additional information on the tactics and technologies they are likely to use in the run-up 
to the election). 
- Though we continue to strengthen the integrity of our elections infrastructure, cyber 
actors, both government‑affiliated and cyber criminals, likely will remain opportunistic 
in their targeting of election-related networks and data, routinely attempting to exploit 
misconfigured or vulnerable public‑facing websites, webservers, and election‑related 
information technology systems. These actors are likely to engage in social engineering 
campaigns, including spear‑phishing and smishing state government officials.

In addition to targeting US critical infrastructure for destructive and disruptive attacks, adversaries 
continue to use cyber and physical espionage tactics to access and steal sensitive information 
from US critical infrastructure networks. Such information enables pre-positioning for future 
attacks, gaining insight into our attack response capabilities, and exfiltrating sensitive data for
