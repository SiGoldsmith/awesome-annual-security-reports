APPLICATION
SECURITY 2024

92%
of companies  had a breach 
due to an application they 
developed

91%
of companies have 
knowingly released 
vulnerable applications

67%
of applications are 
currently hosted in

The responsibility has shifted away from dedicated 
security teams and is now shared between AppSec 
managers and developers. Trust between CISOs, 
development and security teams - called #DevSecTrust 
- is critical if the enterprise going to successfully 
reduce the business risk of vulnerable applications. 
 
 
 
Building #DevSecTrust requires a holistic approach. 
CISOs must understand the issues facing their AppSec 
and development teams while trying to gain greater 
visibility over their enterprise’s AppSec. AppSec 
tools must meet the needs of multiple stakeholders, 
and the rising influence of developers must be 
recognized if organizations are going to successfully 
continue to improve their application security posture. 
 
 
The State of 
Application 
Security
The third annual Future of Application Security survey 
reveals how key stakeholders are responding to this 
challenge. We surveyed 1504 developers, CISOs, and 
AppSec managers from a broad range of industries 
across the US, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions.
 
Discover the current state of application security 
and areas of future investment that will support 
#DevSecTrust. Learn how you compare to your peers 
on AppSec program measurement, the AppSec tools 
they are using right now, and where they plan to invest in 
future. Explore developer experience and influence, and 
the challenges and concerns around cloud deployments. 
Application development has changed.
It has moved from waterfall development with infrequent releases, 
to agile development and continuous delivery. Software is deployed 
multiple times per day, development is complex, and it is increasingly 
cloud-native. This has dramatically changed how organizations need 
to secure their applications.
There is more software deployed 
in more environments, 
and less time available to secure it.
The Future of Application Security 2024  |  p. 3
92% of the organizations surveyed have suffered a breach 
due to a vulnerability in an application they developed. 
Yet, 91% have knowingly deployed vulnerable applications. 
Business deadlines are cited as a main reason for deploying 
vulnerable code.
Team alignment and trust are crucial for a successful 
AppSec program. Alignment and trust between CISOs, 
AppSec professionals, and developers is necessary to 
identify and address vulnerabilities that could impact the 
business. Yet, there are some differences between CISOs, 
AppSec managers, and developers. Developers and AppSec 
managers focus on the things that are in their immediate 
control, while CISOs seem to take a more holistic approach 
to AppSec. 
Developers are increasingly powerful decision-makers 
in the buying process. Developer experience is a crucial 
when considering in any AppSec solution, with vulnerability 
prioritization, secure code training, and seamless AppSec 
integration all key focus areas.

### Known Vulnerabilities and Increasing Complexities are Driving More Breaches
Our survey shows that business risk is rising: 92% of 
companies surveyed have experienced at least one 
security breach as the direct result of a vulnerable 
application they developed in the past 12 months. This is 
a slight increase from 88% who reported breaches last 
year. Concerningly, most companies have experienced 
more than one breach: 2.44 per organization.
Application risk is business risk. With digital 
transformation moving organizations’ physical 
processes and in-person engagement online, 
it means that enterprises are now relying on 
applications more than ever. That dependency can 
become dangerous for businesses of all sizes when 
vulnerabilities enter the application landscape.  
The growing complexity of applications, paired with the 
increase in cloud-native development, has rapidly 
expanded the current attack surface for many 
enterprises. Because of this, we are seeing a shift to 
organizations looking to protect their entire software 
development lifecycle (SDLC), from the first line of code 
all the way to deployment and runtime in the cloud. 
The increased attack surface is reflected in the range 
of factors that respondents said contributed to their 
breaches, including but not limited to: misconfigurations 
in cloud resources, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), 
containers, stolen credentials, weak authentication, 
and risks in software supply chains, including vulnerable 
APIs and open source components.
So, what does this mean? It highlights that breaches 
can happen anywhere across the SDLC. Modern 
application development requires a code to cloud 
approach in order to rise to the challenge of truly 
reducing business risk -  especially when they are being 
developed with both custom and open source code.

<a id="a-code-to-cloud-approach-is-a-must-for-enterprises-today"></a>
### A Code to Cloud Approach is a Must for Enterprises Today
92%
of companies have experienced 
at least one security breach in 
the past 12 months

The Future of Application Security 2024  |  p. 7

![Figure 01: What was the main cause of your security breach? (Bar chart showing responses from Developers, CISO, and AppSec, with categories including Stolen credentials, Cloud resource misconfiguration, Known vulnerability, Vulnerable APIs, Vulnerable open-source, Malicious third-party, and Open-source supply chain attack)]

When we talk about the current state of AppSec, we 
need to understand how our three stakeholders view 
AppSec today, and how that shapes their view of the 
future. Our respondents highlight these differences very 
clearly. CISOs often have their eyes set on the future – 
seeing the overarching picture of how AppSec goals fit 
into the overall business goals. AppSec managers and 
developers on the other hand, are very focused on the 
current state of things – looking directly at what they 
have and oversee now.     
With clear communication between CISOs, AppSec 
managers and development teams, this can be a 
powerful combination. When a CISO can see the 
“big picture”, they are able to offers AppSec and 
development a perspective they might not have 
considered, which then allows them to collectively 
create trust and efficiencies. 

<a id="cisos-have-their-eyes-set-on-the-future"></a>
### CISOs Have Their Eyes Set on the Future

The Future of Application Security 2024  |  p. 8
Developers have become adept at shifting left – we 
can see clearly in the data that they are still primarily 
thinking about vulnerabilities within the coding and 
design phases. AppSec managers seem to continue 
keeping their eyes out for vulnerabilities through the 
go live stage. However, CISOs seem to be embodying 
the code to cloud philosophy by thinking about risk 
throughout the entire SDLC.
When we talk about code to cloud, we are highlighting 
the importance of protecting your entire process.
If CISOs are thinking code to cloud, but developers are 
consistently only focusing within the “code” phase, how 
can we best work to close that gap? 
This is why cloud-native AppSec matters – AppSec 
teams and development teams can use tools like 
runtime insights, and quickly find what needs to  
be fixed along the way, and before their application 
goes live. 

![Figure 02: During what stages of the SDLC do you scan for or find vulnerabilities? (Bar chart showing responses from Developers, CISO, and AppSec, with categories including Coding, Design, Check-in, Build, Testing, Deployment, and Go-live)]

Modern application security is about finding and fixing risk across the entire software 
development lifecycle (SDLC). We asked respondents to tell us at what stage are of the SDLC 
they thinking about  vulnerabilities (Figure 2).

<a id="how-are-enterprises-tackling-application-security-today"></a>
### How are Enterprises Tackling Application Security Today?

The Future of Application Security 2024  |  p. 9

![Figure 03: Which of the following application security technologies/ approaches do you have or plan to have? (Bar chart showing responses for Software supply chain security, SCA, SAST, IaC security, DAST, Container security, and API security, with categories for Currently using, Plan to use, Aware of but no plans to use, and Not aware of)]

AppSec Technology Tooling Adoption Rates
Most respondents already use, or plan to use, 
available AppSec solutions (Figure 3). Businesses are 
adopting the tools to secure their entire application 
development lifecycles.
Organizations are using AppSec tools, however the 
tools that industry professionals assume that every 
organization has (like SAST) still aren’t being used by 
a critical mass. Established tools, like SAST, DAST, 
and SCA still show significant potential for increased 
adoption – they are only in use by about 39% of 
respondents.
When it comes to code to cloud, there are a lot of 
different tools that need to be implemented, however, 
we cannot assume that every organization has mature 
tooling under their belts. It’s important for organizations 
to take an honest look at the state of their AppSec 
maturity before buying separate tools that will inherently 
need internal buy in and support to use and maintain.
There is a lot of discussion around the ownership 
of AppSec tools, and it often centers around how it 
is ownership is shifting towards developers. While 
developers are increasingly being given more of a voice 
when it comes to purchasing decisions for AppSec 
tools, developers main concern will always be how they 
can develop applications. AppSec teams will always 
have the leading role when it comes to driving tool 
adoption, even if development teams are responsible 
for fixing the vulnerabilities.

### What’s in the AppSec Toolkit?

<a id="alignment-is-key-to-appsec-metrics"></a>
### Alignment is Key to AppSec Metrics
The Future of Application Security 2024  |  p. 10

![Figure 04: What security metrics do you collect to show you have a successful AppSec program? (Bar chart showing responses from Developers, CISO, and AppSec, with categories including Mean time to resolve critical vulnerabilities, Vulnerabilities found, Vulnerabilities remediated/mitigated, Vulnerabilities open, Percent of unpatchable assets, Incident response time, Number of security incidents, Number of security policy violations, Number of exceptions granted, and Mean time to detect vulnerabilities)]

To build trust between your stakeholders, it’s important 
that everyone is aligned to a shared set of goals and 
KPIs.  
Unsurprisingly, AppSec and Developers report an equal 
focus metrics that center around vulnerabilities (Figure 
4). Earlier, we talked about the fact that both teams 
are focused on what they currently in charge of, and 
that is reflected here. The industry has made progress 
in engaging developers in security, but there’s more  
work ahead. With AppSec and Developer teams 
aligned, it’s crucial to strengthen trust to meet their 
metrics effectively.
While CISOs continue to take an all-encompassing view 
when it comes to metrics, one thing is clear – finding 
and fixing seems to be what that all three stakeholders 
are aligned to.   

<a id="how-do-you-make-it-easier-productivity-continues-to-outweigh-security"></a>
### How Do You Make It Easier: Productivity Continues to Outweigh Security
The Future of Application Security 2024  |  p. 11

![Figure 05: How do you ensure that your developers fix vulnerabilities in place? (CISO responses) (Bar chart showing responses for Investment in shift left or shift everywhere programming, Shifting developer compensation to incentivize secure coding, Secure code training, and No oversight. Fixing vulnerabilities Is part of their job.)]

What hinders vulnerability remediation? Simple – the 
fact that developers must stop what their primary job 
and goal is and find and fix a vulnerability before they 
can continue with their task. They are caught between 
the proverbial rock and a hard place. To meet the 
AppSec needs of their business, developers are often 
tasked with pressing pause on their productivity, 
moving to another system to scan, and then having 
to figure out how to fix any vulnerabilities before 
continuing through their development process. It’s 
frustrating and a quick way to have trust break down 
between teams.
So, how are CISOs incentivizing developers to want 
to take a more security-focused approach to their 
development cycles?
The replies showed that CISOs are currently trying 
a little bit of everything, from offering secure code 
training to financial incentives (Figure 5).
Regardless of how CISOs are trying to engage 
developers in more secure development processes, 
developers are still predominantly measured on 
productivity, rather than security. Recent research 
published by Gartner echoed these results, reporting 
that software engineering staff were more than 
twice as likely to be measured on release frequency 
(62%) and speed of delivery (58%) than they were 
on the number of vulnerabilities remediated (28%) 
or the mean time to resolve and mitigate critical 
vulnerabilities (30%).

<a id="what-is-driving-appsec-success"></a>
## What is Driving AppSec success?

<a id="security-cannot-be-a-barrier-for-business-success"></a>
### Security Cannot be a Barrier for Business Success
The Future of Application Security 2024  |  p. 12

![Figure 06: What were the top three primary reasons that vulnerable code was released to production? (Bar chart showing responses from AppSec managers, CISOs, and Developers, with categories including To meet a business, feature, or security-related deadline, Vulnerability would be fixed in a later release, Vulnerability was not critical, Hoped the vulnerability would not be exploitable, and Vulnerability was not exploitable)]

91% of organizations say they knowingly deploy 
vulnerable applications. We asked why (Figure 6).
Security knows that business is king. Business velocity 
rules when it comes to releasing applications. Meeting 
a business deadline is in the top three justifications for 
all three stakeholder groups.
This highlights that developers only have limited time 
to address vulnerabilities before demand from the 
business overtakes them; that time must be used wisely. 
To do this, security needs to be inserted seamlessly 
throughout the development process.
Security success cannot come at the expense of 
business success. Developers and AppSec teams 
need support when it comes to prioritizing what to fix 
first and remediation guidance so they can do it fast 
and effectively. CISOs are then tasked with finding 
the most efficient way to drive business forward, while 
also managing the risk that comes with modern day 
application development.

<a id="building-devsectrust-between-security-and-development-teams"></a>
### Building #DevSecTrust Between Security and Development Teams
The Future of Application Security 2024  |  p. 13

![Figure 07: What are your biggest concerns around developing secure code? (Bar chart showing responses from Developers, with categories including Lack of context to remediate vulnerabilities, Security getting in the way of the development process, and Difficulty knowing what to fix and how to prioritize risk)]

Trust between CISOs, AppSec managers, and 
developers is critical since the balance of leadership 
and influence has changed. Historically, AppSec 
managers prescribed the security rules and tools for 
developers to use. Now, developers have much more 
responsibility and influence over buying decisions.
Developer experience is critical. If the AppSec 
program is a barrier to meeting developers’ deadlines, 
the organization won’t achieve its goals. The three 
stakeholder groups have an interdependent relationship. 
Therefore, it is important that trust is built between 
security and development teams.  
We asked developers questions that explore their 
challenges, 
concerns, 
and 
preferences 
around 
enterprise AppSec programs.
Their responses show a gap between what they’d like 
and what they currently experience (Figure 7). They 
are worried about productivity being compromised 
by security, and struggle to prioritize what to fix first, 
as we touched on earlier. These problems might be 
addressed if developers received timely, trustworthy 
data from AppSec tools, in their IDEs and development 
environments, guiding them to the most important 
vulnerabilities.  

<a id="how-do-we-make-appsec-easier-for-developers"></a>
### How Do We Make AppSec Easier for Developers?
The Future of Application Security 2024  |  p. 14

![Figure 08: How important are the following items in your AppSec solution? (Developer responses) (Bar chart showing responses for Integrated/automated into DevOps pipeline, Al-assisted or led remediation assistance, Secure code training, Prioritization to know what to fix first, Low/no false positives or negatives, Not needing to go into a different security tool, and Seeing scan results in my IDE)]

Developers want AppSec solutions that let them do 
their job. They want to see scan results directly in 
their IDE and don’t want to switch to tools outside of 
their development workflow (Figure 8).  
Let’s take a moment to think about how developers 
work. They typically have their preferred systems that 
they work within, and so it’s no surprise that they would 
prefer to work out of that one single space. 67% of 
developers want to see scan results directly into their 
IDE of choice – giving them the ability to figure out what 
they need to prioritize quickly, without leaving their 
development environment.
Developers don’t want to hop from tool to tool – 
 
they want one tool that fits seamlessly within their 
existing workflow.
If CISOs and AppSec teams want to get developers on 
board with prioritizing security, that’s where they should 
focus their efforts. This is even more important as we 
shift our sights to cloud-native application development. 
With the risk surface continuing to grow by using open 
source code in cloud-native application development, 
it’s important to remember that developers are 
critical in remediating all potentially business-critical 
vulnerabilities. Supporting their ability to do their job 
efficiently will only help your organizations overall 
AppSec posture.

<a id="gaps-in-secure-code-training-affect-developer-experience"></a>
### Gaps in Secure Code Training Affect Developer Experience
The Future of Application Security 2024  |  p. 15

![Figure 09: Do you have a program or tools in place to train your developers in writing more secure code? If so, what? (Bar chart showing responses from Developers and AppSec, with categories including Guidance within the IDEs, Formal security training for developers, IT training certificates, and Secure code training)]

Poor developer experience is compounded by a lack 
of training. However, there is a conundrum: your 
developers don’t currently have training, and you 
want to make sure they receive it. However, even if 
you give them training today, it is not immediately 
impactful.
So, how do you give your development team security 
training in a way that allows them to utilize it sooner 
rather than later? Only half of developers say that they 
have access to formal security training, and just slightly 
more (55%) are provided with tools that offer security 
guidance within their IDE (Figure 9).
Guidance directly within the IDE is extremely helpful for 
those developers who don’t have any training. Since we 
know that developers already prefer to stay within their 
IDEs, incorporating guidance within their preferred 
environment can result in an immediate impact on 
developers security knowledge. Meeting developers 
where they are is an important part of improving your 
developer experience, and is a critical pillar when 
thinking about developing #DevSecTrust.

## The Future of AppSec

<a id="who-influences-appsec-tool-selection"></a>
### Who Influences AppSec Tool Selection?
The Future of Application Security 2024  |  p. 16

![Figure 10: Which departments are involved in the purchasing of key applications security solutions? (All “decision maker” responses) (Bar chart showing responses from Developers, AppSec managers, and CISOs)]

AppSec was previously viewed as the sole 
responsibility of the security team. Today, it’s clear 
that there is a true buyer committee when it comes 
to organization’s security investments. 
Why? The “find and fix” goal is the reason why 
organizations seem to be shifting to a committee-
based decision. 
Respondents could select multiple decision makers:
- 50% of developers nominated themselves as key 
decision-makers.
- AppSec managers are more likely to say that 
developers are key decision-makers (63%) than 
themselves (57%).
- CISOs were mostly likely to list their own role as key 
decision-maker, followed by AppSec managers.
For the foreseeable future, AppSec managers will 
continue to be the ones who make the purchase. 
However, they will need significant buy-in from the 
development teams because if the developers won’t 
use the AppSec tool, then all is for naught.
The real question that AppSec managers must consider 
when making their purchase is: “What do your CISOs, 
and developers actually care about?”

<a id="what-factors-influence-appsec-tool-selection"></a>
### What Factors Influence AppSec Tool Selection?
The Future of Application Security 2024  |  p. 17

![Figure 11: What are the top reasons for choosing or recommending your most recent AppSec solutions? (AppSec and CISO responses) (Bar chart showing responses from AppSec with categories including Better integration or built-in with CI/CD processes, Improve the developer experience, and Fast onboarding, and responses from CISO with categories including Consolidation of previous solutions, Improve the developer experience, and Simplifying operational overhead)]

Every stakeholder has slightly different motivations for looking into, and purchasing, certain 
AppSec tools. We asked respondents the top three reasons for choosing or recommending 
their most recent AppSec solution (Figure 11).

![Figure 12: What are the top reasons for choosing or recommending your most recent AppSec solutions? (Developer responses) (Bar chart showing responses from Developers with categories including Securing new application surfaces, Consolidation of our previous solutions, and Simplifying operational overhead)]

Consolidation is a priority for both AppSec managers 
and CISOs, and that comes as no surprise.
With breaches rising and application development 
becoming increasingly complex, organizations are 
scanning at multiple points across the SDLC (see Figure 
3 on p. 9). The result? Companies purchase many 
different tools to cover different security requirements 
(see Figure 4 on p. 10). This is not ideal for developers, 
who want AppSec tools that show them results directly 
in their IDE and not log in to a separate security tool 
(Figure 9 on p. 15).
All of these issues can be addressed by consolidating 
multiple tools into a single platform. Consolidation 
allows security tools and strategies to be streamlined 
for stronger, more coherent defense. It reduces 
overlaps for developers, assists with compliance, and 
cuts costs.  A unified and consolidated approach aligns 
team efforts with key vulnerabilities and reinforces the 
overall security framework. In addition, when you allow 
all three stakeholders to utilize the specific tools they 
need and allow for cross-team transparency.

### Future AppSec Investment
The Future of Application Security 2024  |  p. 18

![Figure 13: Which of the following technologies do you use or plan to use in the next 2-3 years? (All responses) (Bar chart showing responses for Generative Al cybersecurity, Code security assistants, Software bill of materials (SBOM), Application security posture management (ASPM), Software supply chain security, API security testing, and Secure code training, with categories for Already in use and Plan to use)]

As application development grows more complex, new technologies are emerging to help 
developers, improve compliance, and enhance security programs. We asked respondents 
what new technologies they are using, or plan to use, in the coming year (Figure 13).

The Future of Application Security 2024  |  p. 19

![Figure 14: Which of the following technologies do you use or plan to use in the next 2-3 years? (Using or planning to use responses) (Bar chart showing responses for Policy as code, Cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP), Container or kubernetes security, and Serverless security, with categories for Already in use and Plan to use)]

What is the future of AppSec? That depends on 
who you are, and what your organizations goals are. 
Companies are at different places with their AppSec 
based on industry. So, as you start making AppSec 
investments, there are many use-case specific tools to 
consider. Checkmarx’s AppSec Program Methodology 
& Assessment (APMA) digital offering is a great 
resource in understanding your AppSec program’s 
maturity and what steps you can take to improve your 
security posture.
Our survey shows that AppSec tools are a key feature 
in organizations’ future investment plans. When we 
look at the variety of tools that are in the “plan to use” 
phase, we must take a moment to consider how we can 
consolidate on a single platform, to make sure that all 
stakeholders get what they need out of each piece.
The future of AppSec no longer relies on cumbersome 
individual point solutions that difficult to manage – it 
relies on simplifying processes and finding efficiencies 
between tools and teams.
Earlier, we talked to the fact that legacy tools were not 
as widely adopted as we might believe. The current 
adoption rate for new technologies (Figure 13) matches 
the adoption rate of legacy tools at under 40%.  This 
might be a symptom of a few things: tool sprawl, 
lack of AppSec program maturity, under developed 
#DevSecTrust, or even misguided buying decisions.  
At the end of the day, every organization should be able 
to take an honest look at their AppSec program, set 
goals, and then make the proper decisions to help meet 
and exceed those goals.

## Cloud Deployment Dominates, but Concerns Remain
The Future of Application Security 2024  |  p. 20
Cloud-native applications require different things, 
and they require them across the entire SDLC. As 
enterprises invest in a code to cloud approach to 
AppSec, they are also moving their focus to the later 
stages of the development lifecycle.
Our survey found that 67% of applications are currently 
deployed in the cloud. It is not surprising that the CISOs 
we surveyed also said that maintaining and managing 
cloud risk is one of their top priorities for the year ahead.

As 
organizations 
invest 
in 
the 
code-to-cloud 
philosophy they must adapt their AppSec accordingly. 
Key concerns about cloud deployment vary between 
AppSec managers and CISOs, with CISOs again 
showing their more holistic approach (Figure 14).
To address these concerns, organizations are deploying 
cloud security approaches. More than 70% are using, 
or planning to use, cloud-related security tools (Figure 
15), with AppSec managers more likely to say these are 
already in use.
As AppSec programs become more complex, 
consolidating all their AppSec tools into one central 
platform will be critical for success.
It’s important to remember that stakeholders, especially 
CISOs, are constantly thinking about securing their 
applications from code to cloud. We expect a greater 
focus on cloud-native application security that is 
focused on bringing AppSec directly to cloud-native 
applications, while also still securing the rest of the 
application footprint.
