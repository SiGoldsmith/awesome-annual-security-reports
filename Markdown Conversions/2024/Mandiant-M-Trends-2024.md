Introduction
M\-Trends

2024 Special Report

SPECIAL REPORT: MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 2023EMBARGO4

One of the big takeaways from our 2023 
engagements, and consequently a key 
theme of M\-Trends 2024, is that attackers 
are focusing more on evasion. They are 
aiming to avoid detection technologies (such 
as endpoint detection and response) and 
maintain persistence on networks for as long 
as possible, either by targeting edge devices, 
leveraging “living off the land” and other 
techniques, or through the use of zero\-day 
vulnerabilities in security and other solutions 
prevalent throughout enterprises. 

Despite attackers’ efforts to evade detection, 
defenders are continuing to get better at 
identifying compromises. The global median 
dwell time—dwell time is the number of days 
an attacker is on a system from compromise 
to detection—continued its downward trend in 
2023, and is now 10 days (from 16 days in the 
previous year). It’s a big victory for the good 
guys, but ransomware is still a key factor in 
driving down dwell time since it tends to be 
detected more quickly. Furthermore, Mandiant 
red teams typically achieve their objectives in 
5 to 7 days, so defenders must remain vigilant.

M\-Trends 2024 features data and other 
security metrics that readers have come to 
expect, highlights zero\-day use by espionage 

and financially\-motivated attackers, and 
dives deep into evasive actions conducted 
particularly by Chinese espionage groups. 
Other key takeaways in this report include:

• Evolving phishing trends such as attacker 

use of social media, SMS and other 
communications technologies

• Tactics to bypass multi\-factor authentication 
such as adversary\-in\-the\-middle and other 
techniques

• Cloud intrusion trends such as targeting of 
cloud infrastructure as well as attacker use 
of cloud resources

• Use of AI in red and purple team 

engagements, with a focus on how new 
technologies can help produce better 
outcomes for organizations

Mandiant consultants are always on the 
frontlines, investigating and analyzing the 
latest cyber attacks, and understanding how 
best to defend against them. Consultants 
proactively assess clients against the latest 
attacker tactics, techniques and procedures, 
and help with remediation, transformation 
and education. 

Through the release of our annual M\-Trends 
report, we share our learnings with the greater 
security community, building on our dedication 
to providing critical knowledge to those tasked 
with defending organizations. The information 
in this report has been sanitized to protect the 
identities of victims and their data.

The metrics reported in M\-Trends 2024 are based on Mandiant Consulting investigations of targeted attack activity conducted 
between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023\. 

Internal detection is 
when an organization 
independently discovers 
it has been compromised, 
such as through an internal 
security appliance alert 
or internal personnel 
notification of suspicious 
activity.

External notification is 
when an outside entity, such 
as law enforcement agencies, 
cybersecurity companies, or 
industry partners, informs 
an organization it has been 
compromised. In some cases, 
attackers will perform this 
notification, such as through 
a ransom note. 

Detection by Source

In 2023, more than half of compromised organizations (54%) first learned of a compromise 
from an external source, while 46% first identified evidence of a compromise internally. 
However, separating out ransomware\-related intrusions reveals that it was much more 
common for an organization to learn of a ransomware\-related incident from an external 
source. For ransomware\-related intrusions, 70% of organizations were externally notified, 
in most cases, via a ransom demand from the attacker. For intrusions that were not linked 
to ransomware, the ratio of internal versus external discovery was even, 50% to 50%. Of the 
internally discovered intrusions, 85% did not involve ransomware. 

The percentage of externally notified intrusions decreased from 63% in 2022 to 54% in 
2023\. Mandiant also responded to more ransomware\-related intrusions in 2023 than in 
2022\. Ransomware events are most often discovered through external means. Despite 
this, Mandiant observed a nine point drop in external notifications. This year\-over\-year 
shift, along with the high proportion of internally discovered compromises in cases other 
than ransomware, suggests that organizations are experiencing higher rates of success in 
detecting malicious behavior on their networks.

A ransomware\-related 
intrusion provides access 
for or is associated with 
an attacker that has the 
primary goal of encrypting 
data, with the intention of 
extracting payment from 
the target in order to avoid 
further harm or to undo the 
malicious action.

Ransomware\-Related Intrusions

In 70% of cases, organizations learned of ransomware\-related intrusions from external 
sources. Organizations were notified of a ransomware incident by an attacker ransom note 
in three fourths of those intrusions. This is consistent with the extortion business model in 
which attackers intentionally and abruptly notify organizations of a ransomware intrusion 
and demand payment. The remaining quarter of external notifications for ransomware 
intrusions came from external partners, such as law enforcement or security companies. 
In 2022, attacker notifications represented two thirds of external notifications for 
ransomware intrusions, compared to one third coming from external partners.

Dwell Time

Global median dwell time continued a downward trend marking another notable shortest 
time period between initial intrusion and detection for all M\-Trends reporting periods. In 
2023, most organizations detected intrusions within 10 days of the initial intrusion. This is 
a decline of nearly one week compared to 16 days in 2022\. 

Mandiant defenders observed notable improvements in global median dwell time in 2023 
across all notification sources. With the shortest periods across the board, global median 
dwell time for external notification sources decreased to 13 days in 2023 from 19 days in 
2022\. This likely indicates improved communication between organizations targeted and 
external parties making notifications. Another likely explanation for this decrease could be 
the increase of ransomware\-related adversary notifications. 

Maintaining the ongoing trend, when defenders detect adversary intrusions internally, 
they do so faster than the overall median dwell time. The global median dwell time for 
intrusions detected internally was nine days in 2023, down from 13 days in 2022 and from 
18 days in 2021\. 

Dwell time is calculated 
as the number of days an 
attacker is present in a 
compromised environment 
before they are detected. 
The median represents 
a value at the midpoint 
of a dataset sorted by 
magnitude.

Global Dwell Time Distribution

Dwell time distribution measures the percentage of Mandiant\-investigated intrusions 
with a specific range of dwell time. In 2023, Mandiant experts continued to see intrusions 
detected earlier, with 43% of intrusions being detected in one week or less. Nearly two 
thirds of all intrusions in 2023 were detected within 30 days. This likely indicates that 
detection capabilities continue to improve across organizations, allowing defenders to 
be notified of threats during the initial infection or reconnaissance phases of the targeted 
attack lifecycle, similar to previous M\-Trends reports.

Mandiant observed a decrease in intrusions that remain undiscovered for long periods 
of time compared to previous years. In 2023, 6% of investigations identified activity that 
remained undetected for between 1 and 5 years, compared to 11% in 2022 and higher 
percentages prior to 2020\. Although organizations are still facing intrusions that go 
undetected for longer periods of time, defenders will likely see the distribution of dwell 
time move to the left as external parties, such as security vendors and law enforcement, 
increase their involvement and pace of notifications. However, detection capabilities 
and continuous hunting throughout environments have been effective at unearthing 
long\-standing intrusions. As actionable information is shared, detection capabilities will 
continue to improve. 

Broadly, the long\-term trends of declining median dwell time and increasing rates of 
internal discovery of compromises indicate that organizations have made meaningful, 
measurable improvements in their defensive capabilities.

ransomware\-related intrusions back to where it was previously in 2021\.

Globally, organizations detected ransomware or received a ransom demand faster in 
2023–in five days compared to nine days in 2022–regardless of notification source. Non\-
ransomware\-related intrusions were detected in 13 days, compared to 17 days in 2022\. 

Intrusions involving ransomware were detected in six days when the notification came 
from an internal source, compared to 12 days in 2022\. Defenders were notified of 
ransomware\-related intrusions from an external party in five days in 2023, two days 
quicker than what was observed in 2022\.

Ransomware attacks have continued to be a driving factor in reducing dwell time over the 
years. However, in 2023, Mandiant experts observed notable improvements in decreased 
dwell time across all notification sources and investigation types. 

Intrusions that did not involve ransomware were identified in a shorter period of time in 
2023\. Notably, intrusions that occurred in 2023 were identified internally in little over a 
week, with nine days between initial intrusion and detection, compared to 13 days in 2022\. 
Organizations were notified by an external party of an intrusion one week faster in 2023, 
resulting in a 20\-day median dwell time for externally notified, non\-ransomware\-related 
intrusions, compared to 27 days in 2022\.

Industry Targeting

In 2023, Mandiant most frequently responded to intrusions at financial services 
organizations, followed by business and professional services, high tech, retail and 
hospitality, and healthcare. All of these sectors have access to a variety of sensitive 
information, including proprietary business information, personally identifiable information 
(PII), protected health information (PHI), and financial data. Attackers have also abused 
service providers and technology organizations to facilitate third\-party compromises or 
to obtain access to data or networks belonging to many organizations through a single 
compromise. Mandiant consistently finds these sectors toward the top of the list for share 
of investigations. Government sector investigations declined from first to tied for fifth with 
healthcare in 2023, potentially reflecting fewer new investigations related to the war in 
Ukraine compared to 2022\.

Targeted Attacks
Initial Infection Vector

In 2023, Mandiant experts once again saw exploits used as the most prevalent adversary 
initial infection vector. In intrusions where the initial intrusion vector was identified, 38% 
of intrusions started with an exploit. This is a six percentage point increase from 2022, 
consistent with what defenders faced in 2021\. For more information, please see “Attacker 
Operations Involving Zero\-Days Vary Depending on Motivation”. 

Phishing remained the second most common intrusion vector. However it declined in 2023, 
with 17% of intrusions, compared to 22% in 2022\. Phishing remains an effective method to 
establish an initial foothold and a popular threat vector for adversaries. Full analysis can be 
found in “Evolution of Phishing Among Shifting Security Controls”.

Prior compromises were the third most significant intrusion vector used by attackers in 
2023\. Mandiant investigators noted a three percentage point increase in 2023 compared 
to what was observed in 2022 with 15% of intrusions beginning with access provided by 
a prior compromise. This increase is likely related to the ransomware ecosystem and the 
continued partnership between ransomware affiliates and various malware operators 
selling initial access.

Special Report: Mandiant M\-Trends 202414

Stolen credentials pose a serious security risk to organizations and were the fourth most 
notable initial intrusion vector in 2023\. Attackers often obtain credentials due to password 
reuse or users inadvertently downloading trojanized software on corporate devices. 
Infostealers are frequently delivered through trojanized software. In 2023, 10% of 
intrusions began with evidence of stolen credentials, compared to 14% observed in 2022\. 
The prevalence of both widespread information stealer malware and credential purchasing 
continue to challenge defenders.

Brute\-force attacks round out the top five initial intrusion vectors observed in 2023, 
representing 6% of intrusions. Proper implementation of multi\-factor authentication has 
been pivotal to slowing down attackers in their attempts to compromise environments. 

Attackers continue to leverage effective tactics to gain access to target environments and 
conduct their operations. While the most popular infection vectors fluctuate, organizations 
must focus on defense\-in\-depth strategies. This approach can help mitigate the impact of 
both common and less frequent initial intrusion methods. 

In 2023, when the initial intrusion vector was identified, an exploit was observed 38% of 
the time. Mandiant continues to observe both cyber espionage and financially motivated 
attackers leveraging zero\-day vulnerabilities to conduct their operations. The most 
prevalent vulnerability Mandiant investigators observed in 2023 was CVE\-2023\-34362,1 
an SQL injection vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer that Mandiant rated as high risk.2 The 
second most prevalent vulnerability was CVE\-2022\-21587, a critical unauthenticated file 
upload vulnerability in Oracle E\-Business Suite. The third most prevalent vulnerability in 
2023 was CVE\-2023\-2868\. CVE\-2023\-2868 is a critical command injection vulnerability 
in Barracuda Email Security Gateways (physical appliances). These vulnerabilities were 
heavily exploited by attackers, and notably the first and third most targeted vulnerabilities 
were related to edge devices. For more information on the continued targeting of these 
devices, please see Chinese Espionage Operations Targeting The Visibility Gap. 

However, Mandiant experts also observed attackers’ continued use of exploits throughout 
the attack lifecycle to maintain access, move laterally, and complete their mission. 
Mandiant continues to observe a handful of vulnerabilities related to older technologies, 
such as Microsoft Access 2003 (CVE\-2008\-2463\),3 Microsoft Windows Server 2016 (CVE\-
2017\-0144\),4 and Telerik (CVE\-2019\-18935\).5

Ransomware

The proportion of intrusions Mandiant responded to that served financially motivated 
objectives increased from more than a quarter of all investigations, 26%, in 2022 to more 
than a third, 36%, in 2023\. Ransomware\-related intrusions represented almost two thirds of 
financially motivated intrusions and 23% of all 2023 intrusions. 

The remaining financially motivated intrusions included data theft extortion without 
ransomware encryption, attackers establishing initial access to facilitate other operations, 
business email compromise (BEC) fraud, and cryptocurrency theft events. Mandiant 
attributed several financially motivated intrusions to likely North Korean6 state\-sponsored 
attackers, including cryptocurrency theft and IT worker wage theft. Mandiant continues to 
track North Korean threat groups that conduct financially motivated activity to cover both 
operational costs as well as larger scale activity intended to generate revenue for 
the state.7 

The upward trend in ransomware and other extortion\-related investigations in 2023 is 
consistent with Mandiant and open\-source observations of a marked increase in listings 
on data leak sites (DLS) and extortion revenue estimates.8 DLS are websites where the 
illicitly retrieved data of companies that refuse to pay a ransom are published. While 
this data is skewed toward targets who refused to pay attackers’ ransom demands, it is 
still useful for understanding broad trends in extortion operations. The FIN11 MOVEit 
exploitation campaign and UNC39449 activity described in the Evolution of Phishing 
section showcase the prevalence of extortion intrusions without ransomware encryption.

Data Theft

Mandiant identified data theft in 37% of 2023 intrusions, which is slightly lower than the 
40% of intrusions reported in 2022\. In 11% of intrusions, attackers directly monetized 
stolen data through extortion. In an additional 7%, they used a combination of data theft, 
ransomware, and extortion, also known as multifaceted extortion. Mandiant also observed 
attackers steal credentials and other data likely to facilitate reconnaissance of target 
networks. Several cases involved large\-scale data theft that included intellectual property. 
Mandiant also identified instances of targeted or selective data theft by groups such as 
the Russian cyber espionage group APT2910 and the suspected Chinese cyber espionage 
cluster UNC4841\.11

In 2023, Mandiant experts continued to observe attackers use compromised architecture 
to conduct email spam, distribute botnets, and perform some types of cryptomining 
activity. During the past three years, intrusions related to compromised architecture 
have been heavily automated following the mass exploitation of vulnerabilities. Publicly 
released proof\-of\-concept (PoC) code for new exploits increases the ease of automating 
attacks, accelerating the attack cycle for adversaries abusing compromised infrastructure. 
Publicly available PoC code for vulnerabilities makes it simple for attackers to automate 
their exploits using scanning tools.

In 2023, Mandiant noted a decrease in the number of investigations that identified 
multiple threat groups in a single environment. In 17% of investigations, Mandiant experts 
uncovered more than one threat group operating in the target environment. This likely is 
related to the volume of targeted zero\-days that Mandiant investigated. The 10 percentage 
point decrease from 2022 (27%) suggests a positive trend, potentially resulting from 
defenders’ efforts to limit the ability of additional attackers to infiltrate environments.

investigations in 2023\. These counts are largely in line with 2022 observations. For 
example in 2022, 265 groups were both newly tracked and observed in Mandiant 
investigations. In 2023, organizations faced intrusions by two named advanced persistent 
threat (APT) groups from Russia and Iran; four named financial threat (FIN) groups; and 
310 uncategorized (UNC) groups. While 253 of these UNC groups were newly identified, 
Mandiant has tracked the remaining 57 UNC groups for periods ranging from one to 10 
years. This distribution of threat groups suggests that organizations contend with both 
established and new threats on a regular basis.

UNC Group When 
Mandiant encounters new 
threat activity that cannot 
confidently be linked to an 
existing group, an UNC group 
designation is created to tie 
together observable artifacts 
associated with the activity 
cluster. As new information 
and artifacts are discovered 
that can be tied back to 
the same activity cluster, 
Mandiant analysts build on 
the initial understanding 
of the attacker, potentially 
merging it with other tracked 
threat clusters and ultimately 
graduating the UNC to an 
APT or FIN group.

More than half of the attackers observed in 2023 (52%) were primarily motivated by 
financial gain, and 10% principally pursued espionage activities. A very small percentage, 
just 2%, included threat clusters Mandiant judged to be operating for hacktivist 
motivations, attackers focused on disruption or destruction, and pentesters. For the 
remaining 36% of threat clusters, there was not sufficient evidence to determine a specific 
motivation with a high degree of confidence. Compared to 2022, Mandiant observed 
modest declines in the proportion of attackers pursuing objectives of espionage, 
disruption and destruction, hacktivism, and influence operations. Financially motivated 
groups made up a larger share of observed attackers in 2023, 52%, compared to 48% in 
2022, a shift at least partially explained by the growth in ransomware\- and extortion\-

APT43

In 2023, Mandiant graduated one new named threat group, APT43, and merged 189 activity 
clusters into other threat groups based on extensive research into activity overlaps. For 
details on how Mandiant defines and references UNC groups and merges, please see, 
“How Mandiant Tracks Uncategorized Threat Actors.”12

APT43 is a prolific cyber operator that supports the interests of the North Korean 
Government. The group combines moderately sophisticated technical capabilities with 
aggressive social engineering tactics, especially against South Korean and U.S. 
government organizations, academics, and think tanks focused on geopolitical issues 
surrounding the Korean Peninsula. In addition to its espionage campaigns, we believe 
APT43 funds itself through cyber crime operations to support its primary mission of 
collecting strategic intelligence. The group creates numerous spoofed and fraudulent 
personas for use in social engineering as well as cover identities for purchasing 
operational tooling and infrastructure. APT43 has collaborated with other North Korean 
espionage operators on multiple operations, underscoring the major role APT43 plays in 
North Korea’s cyber apparatus. For more details, see the full APT43 report.13

Newly Tracked and 
Observed Malware Families

Malware

In 2023, Mandiant began tracking 626 new malware families, 128 of which were seen in 
incident response investigations. This is the highest number of net new malware families 
Mandiant has identified in a single year to date. However, this figure is not drastically 
higher than the 588 malware families that were newly tracked in 2022, which suggests that 
adversaries could be increasing their toolsets at a similar rate. 

While Mandiant observed an increase in the number of newly tracked malware families in 
2023, the total number of observed families declined from 321 to 277\. This decrease may 
reflect the increased use of previously established tools and/or the rising number of 
compromises that use no malware at all. Of all 277 malware families observed in 
intrusions, 128 were newly tracked in 2023\. 

Special Report: Mandiant M\-Trends 202421

A malware category 
describes a malware family’s 
primary purpose. Each 
malware family is assigned 
only one category that 
best describes its primary 
purpose, regardless of 
functionality for more than 
one category.

New Malware Families by Category

The top five malware categories have remained relatively consistent year over year. Of 
the 626 newly tracked malware families, the top five categories include backdoors (33%), 
downloaders (16%), droppers (15%), credential stealers (7%), and ransomware (5%). Newly 
tracked credential stealers return to the top five categories in 2023 after a brief hiatus 
observed in 2022\. Another notable change in rankings is the decrease in newly tracked 
ransomware families, from 7% of malware families to 5% of newly tracked families in 
2023\. Although Mandiant responded to a similar proportion of ransomware intrusions in 
2023 as in 2021, the decline in net new ransomware families may reflect the prevalence of 
ransomware strains that existed prior to 2023, such as LOCKBIT, ALPHV, BASTA, 
and ROYALLOCKER.

An observed malware 
family is a malware family 
identified during an 
investigation by Mandiant 
experts.

Observed Malware Families by Category

Observed malware family categories were also relatively consistent with the findings from 
previous years. Mandiant experts observed 277 malware families during investigations 
conducted in 2023\. Backdoors remain the favorite among attackers, making up 34% of 
the observed malware dataset. This is up one percentage point from 2022\. The remaining 
observed malware family categories show ransomware (11%), droppers (9%), downloaders 
(9%), and tunnelers (6%) rounding out the top five.

Mandiant continues to see a rise in attacker use of remote administration tools and other 
utilities to conduct their operations, noted in the continued increase in the “Other” category 
year over year. Of the 20% of malware families in this category, 8% represent legitimate 
utilities or remote administration tools. While not inherently malicious, attackers often 
leverage these tools in intrusions to evade detection, demonstrating their continued 
resourcefulness. To remain undetected and carry out further operations, attackers use 
living\-off\-the\-land (LotL) techniques by employing system tools that are already in the 
environment or they abuse remote administrator tools that are less likely to be flagged by 
default in security technologies like Endpoint Detection and Response tooling.

A publicly available tool 
or malware family is 
readily obtainable without 
restriction. This includes tools 
that are freely available on 
the internet as well as tools 
that are sold or purchased, 
as long as they can be 
purchased by any buyer.

A non\-public tool or 
malware family is, to the 
best of our knowledge, not 
publicly available (either 
for free or for sale). They 
may include tools that are 
privately developed, held or 
used, as well as tools that are 
shared among or sold to a 
restricted set of customers.

Malware by Availability

Malware family availability for both newly tracked and observed malware families remains 
more heavily weighted toward non\-public in 2023, similar to previous M\-Trends reporting. 
In both categories, malware families are more often privately developed or have restricted 
availability. Adversaries traditionally use a variety of non\-public malware to conduct 
their operations. However, the share of publicly available malware families observed in 
investigations has increased by one percentage point from 2021 to 2022 and again from 
2022 to 2023 to arrive at 30%. The increased use of publicly available malware likely 
reflects the rise in financially motivated attackers who prioritize speed and efficiency over 
long\-term stealth.

Most Frequently Seen Malware

BEACON remains the most frequently observed malware family in Mandiant investigations 
globally and was identified in 10% of all intrusions. While BEACON remains the favorite 
among attackers, during the past three years Mandiant has seen a decrease in BEACON 
usage. In 2021, 28% of intrusions had at least one BEACON backdoor used. At the time, 
ransomware groups were actively compromising organizations across the globe and 
frequently used BEACON to conduct operations. In 2022, there was a global decrease 
in ransomware\-related intrusions, and once again the usage of BEACON reflected that 
decrease. However, in 2023, Mandiant defenders noted BEACON usage at an all time low, 
despite an increase in ransomware intrusions.

This decrease could align with attackers moving to evade endpoint security technology 
with memory resident malware, utilizing third\-party remote administration tools, and 
employing more LotL techniques, or the abuse of native tools and processes on a system. 
Another possibility could be that attackers are migrating away from the command and 
control (C2\) framework Cobalt Strike and the use of BEACON as their primary backdoor. 
As robust security community driven detections have created increased mitigations for 
the Cobalt Strike framework, attackers will increasingly turn to other C2 avenues such as 
SLIVER, Brute Ratel, and Mythic, to support operations. 

ALPHV and LOCKBIT were the second and fifth most frequently observed malware families, 
respectively, in 2023\. Mandiant encountered ALPHV ransomware in 5% of Mandiant led 
investigations in 2023 compared to 2% in 2022\. 

The third and sixth most prevalent malware families Mandiant observed were related 
to the first and third most exploited vulnerabilities. LEMURLOOT (5%) and SEASPY (2%) 
are backdoors used by attackers following exploitation of the MOVEit and Barracuda 
technologies respectively. The remaining frequently observed malware families have been 
used by multiple attackers, some also in conjunction with ALPHV, LOCKBIT, LEMURLOOT 
and SEASPY.

BEACON

ALPHV

LEMURLOOT

SYSTEMBC

A backdoor written in C/C\+\+ that is part of the Cobalt Strike framework. Supported backdoor 
commands include shell command execution, file transfer, file execution, and file management. 
BEACON can also capture keystrokes and screenshots as well as act as a proxy server. BEACON 
may also be tasked with harvesting system credentials, port scanning, and enumerating systems 
on a network. BEACON communicates with a C2 server via HTTP or DNS. Mandiant has seen 
BEACON used by a wide range of named threat groups including APT19, APT32, APT40, APT41, 
FIN6, FIN7, FIN9, FIN11, FIN12 and FIN13, as well as more than 800 UNC groups.

Ransomware written in Rust. The ransomware may contain a plaintext JSON configuration that 
specifies the ransomware functionality. ALPHV may be able to escalate its privileges and bypass 
UAC, likely contains AES and ChaCha20 (or Salsa) encryption functionality, may use the Restart 
Manager as part of its operations, deletes volume shadow copies, may enumerate disk volumes 
and network shares, and may kill processes and services. Mandiant has seen more than 20 UNC 
groups with financial gain goals use ALPHV.

LEMURLOOT is a web shell written in C\# tailored to interact with the MOVEit Transfer platform. The 
malware authenticates incoming connections via a hard\-coded password and can run commands 
that will download files from the MOVEit Transfer system, extract its Azure system settings, 
retrieve detailed record information, create and insert a particular user, or delete this same user. 
Data returned to the system interacting with LEMURLOOT is Gzip compressed.Based on Mandiant 
observations, FIN11 is the primary user of LEMURLOOT. 

A tunneler written in C that retrieves proxy\-related commands from a C2 server using a custom 
binary protocol over TCP. A C2 server directs SYSTEMBC to act as a proxy between the C2 server 
and a remote system. SYSTEMBC is also capable of retrieving additional payloads via HTTP. Some 
variants may use the Tor network for this purpose. Downloaded payloads may be written to disk or 
mapped directly into memory prior to execution. SYSTEMBC is often used to hide network traffic 
associated with other malware families. Observed families include DANABOT, SMOKELOADER, 
and URSNIF. Mandiant has seen FIN12 and more than 40 UNC groups with financial gain goals use 
SYSTEMBC..

LOCKBIT

A ransomware written in C that encrypts files stored locally and on network shares. LOCKBIT can 
also identify additional systems on a network and propagate via SMB. Prior to encrypting files, 
LOCKBIT clears event logs, deletes volume shadow copies, and terminates processes and services 
that may impact its ability to encrypt files. LOCKBIT has been observed using the file extension 
“.lockbit” for encrypted files. Mandiant has seen more than 30 UNC groups with financial gain 
goals use LOCKBIT..

SEASPY

SEASPY is a backdoor that establishes a PCAP filter on port 25 (SMTP) and is activated when a 
“magic packet” is received. SEASPY masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda Network Service and 
changes its process in memory for further evasion. Mandiant has only seen UNC4841 use SEASPY.

METASPLOIT

A penetration testing framework whose features include vulnerability testing, network 
enumeration, payload generation and execution, and defense evasion. The framework contains 
exploits for numerous applications and popular operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and 
macOS. METASPLOIT is commonly used to generate a stager payload, which is responsible for 
downloading and executing the framework’s METERPRETER backdoor. Mandiant has seen APT32, 
APT41, APT43, FIN6, FIN7, FIN11, FIN13, and more than 160 UNC groups use Metasploit.

REGEORG

An open\-source utility used to tunnel webshell traffic. Mandiant has seen APT28, APT29, APT41 and 
30 UNC groups use REGEORG.

Notable Law Enforcement Actions

In a December 2023 press release, the United States Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported14 that ALPHV, also known 
as BlackCat, had targeted more than 1,000 organizations. The 
FBI’s press release also outlined the disruption campaign and 
the development of a decryption tool that allowed the FBI to 
offer help to a number of impacted organizations. Mandiant 
tracks the ALPHV ransomware operator as UNC3507, and 
several other clusters of activity as affiliates, most notably 
UNC3944, UNC4696, and UNC4896\. 

The fifth most frequently observed malware family across 
2023 Mandiant investigations was LOCKBIT. LOCKBIT 
ransomware appeared in 4% of investigations compared to 2% 
in 2022\. The LOCKBIT data leak site listed more targets than 
any other extortion group in 2023 by a significant margin. In 
June 2023, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) 
announced criminal charges15 against a LOCKBIT affiliate, the 
third individual charged by the DOJ for their role in the global 
LOCKBIT ransomware operation. Since LOCKBIT first appeared 
in early 2020, the DOJ has noted that there have been more than 
1,400 attacks conducted by LOCKBIT ransomware\-as\-a\-service 
(RaaS) affiliates. International law enforcement continued to 
pursue LOCKBIT activity, announcing seizure of the LOCKBIT 
data leak site and back\-end infrastructure in “Operation Cronos” 
in February 2024\.16 Mandiant tracks the LOCKBIT ransomware 
operator as UNC2758 and five other notable affiliate groups. 

Ransomware families like ALPHV and LOCKBIT operate within 
their own criminal ecosystems. Following the December 2023 
law enforcement disruption of ALPHV, the operators of the 
LOCKBIT ransomware service attempted to take advantage of 
the situation by appealing to ALPHV affiliates and attempting 
to undercut negotiation processes ALPHV targets had already 
engaged in. Despite these disruptions and arrests by law 
enforcement, ransomware groups remain resilient and adapt 
quickly, mitigating the impact on their operations. While law 
enforcement efforts have yielded decryptors and temporary 
slowdowns, the profitability of ransomware incentivizes 
financially motivated adversaries to continue their attacks, 
highlighting the need for organizations to maintain strong 
security practices.

Operating System Effectiveness

In 2023, Mandiant noted a slight increase in newly tracked malware effective on Linux 
systems at 16%, compared to 12% in 2022\. Notably, observed malware effective on Linux 
has increased to 31% of all malware observed in 2023, compared to 15% in 2022\. Similar to 
previous M\-Trends reporting periods, most newly tracked and observed malware families 
still remain effective on Windows. The apparent decline in the percentage of Windows\-
related malware from 2022 to 2023 likely reflects the greater share of Linux\-related 
malware rather than a true decline in malware effective on Windows.

MITRE ATT\&CK® is a globally 
accessible knowledge 
base of adversary tactics 
and techniques based on 
real\-world observations. 
The ATT\&CK knowledge 
base is used as a foundation 
for the development of 
specific threat models and 
methodologies in the private 
sector, government, and the 
cybersecurity product and 
service community.

Threat Techniques 

Since M\-Trends 2020, Mandiant has supported the community by mapping findings 
presented in M\-Trends to the MITRE ATT\&CK framework. As organizations continue to 
strengthen their security measures, they can work to prioritize implementing detection 
capabilities based on techniques and sub\-techniques used in intrusions. Mandiant 
provides metrics around the most frequently observed techniques that adversaries used 
as a resource to organizations as they make decisions on how to further improve their 
security capabilities. 

Mandiant has mapped an additional 1,200\+ Mandiant techniques to the updated MITRE 
ATT\&CK framework, bringing the total to 3,500\+ Mandiant techniques and subsequent 
findings associated with the ATT\&CK framework. In 2023, the MITRE ATT\&CK framework 
was updated to version 14\.1, resulting in ATT\&CK for Enterprise now containing 201 
techniques and 427 sub\-techniques.

MITRE ATT\&CK Techniques Used Most Frequently, 2023

74%

Observed in 
Mandiant Investigations

Mandiant experts observed adversaries use 74% of MITRE ATT\&CK techniques and 44% 
of sub\-techniques during 2023 intrusions. Nearly three quarters of mapped ATT\&CK 
techniques and almost half of the sub\-techniques were actively observed in intrusions 
Mandiant investigated in 2023\. This breadth of techniques and sub\-techniques is at the 
same magnitude that Mandiant defenders observed in 2022\. 

The techniques that attackers used in 2023 are consistent with those observed in 2022, 
with the top 10 most frequently seen techniques showing little variance over the last 
several years. In more than half of investigations, Mandiant investigators noted the use of 
a command or scripting interpreter (T1059\) by attackers. Notable differences in the 2023 
dataset is the presence of System Owner or User Discovery (T1033\) and use of exploits 
against a public\-facing application (T1190\) in the top 10 list of observed techniques. These 
two techniques correlate with the rise of ransomware\-related intrusions and the increase 
in exploit use, specifically mass exploitation campaigns observed in 2023\. 

It is unsurprising that the top five observed sub\-techniques are PowerShell (T1059\.001\), 
Web Protocols (T1071\.001\), Remote Desktop Protocol (T1021\.001\), Service Execution 
(T1569\.002\), and File Deletion (T1070\.004\), as this is the fourth consecutive year they 
have dominated the charts. Attackers likely favor these sub\-techniques because they 
utilize readily available tools within a system, making them easy to abuse. Their history 
of successful compromises, combined with the ability to sometimes evade security 
measures, makes them a highly effective part of an attacker’s toolkit. This persistent trend 
reveals the standard tactics attackers employ to achieve their objectives. Organizations 
must prioritize detecting these sub\-techniques if they haven’t done so already.

single objective at multiple 
targets within a relevant 
timeframe.17

Global events are a set 
of impactful intrusions 
conducted by multiple 
unrelated adversaries in 
parallel campaigns involving 
a similar theme, target, or 
resource. 

When Mandiant experts observe that multiple organizations are actively being impacted 
by similar threat activity, a campaign or global event is created. A Campaign is a set of 
activity in which one or more threat groups coordinate to achieve a single objective. Larger 
scale Global Events can encompass multiple threat groups pursuing multiple disparate 
objectives, but using similar tactics, often exploiting a vulnerability. Campaigns and Global 
Events (CGE) provide clients with notification of emerging and active threat activity. Over 
the course of each campaign and global event, Mandiant dynamically updates potential 
targets with new data as more information is received and analyzed. This intelligence 
includes indicators of compromise, context surrounding key events, and defensive and 
prevention measures based directly on data collected from Mandiant investigations and 
other Mandiant research.

Campaigns and Global Events provide Mandiant clients with the critical intelligence 
needed to defend against today’s most dangerous threats. Early identification of active 
exploits means attacks can be halted quickly, minimizing damage. CGEs facilitate rapid 
collaboration between teams, ensuring a swift response. As Mandiant uncovers new 
threat data, CGE users receive immediate updates, enabling them to refine defenses and 
pinpoint the attack’s full impact. Mandiant tracked and reported 25 campaigns and global 
events in 2023 related to Mandiant Consulting investigations. These campaigns affected 
organizations across the Americas, EMEA, and JAPAC from 21 industry verticals.

The FIN11 MOVEit exploitation campaign represents a prominent example of this type 
of event. The CVE\-2023\-34362 Retrospective Timeline illustrates observations related to 
FIN11’s18 exploitation of this vulnerability.19

Mandiant investigators observed FIN11 scanning the internet beginning on May 15, 
2023, using infrastructure that was subsequently used to exploit the MOVEit zero\-day 
vulnerability. Based on analysis from Mandiant incident response engagements, the 
earliest evidence of exploitation of CVE\-2023\-34362 occurred twelve days later, on May 
27, 2023\. The evidence also indicates that FIN11 began stealing data from numerous 
organizations via MOVEit technology within 16 hours of the first exploitation of the 
vulnerability. On May 31, 2023, Progress disclosed the vulnerability, patched its cloud\-
based service, and released a patch for on\-premises implementations. It was not until 10 
days following the first successful exploitation of the vulnerability, on June 6, 2023, that 
FIN11 claimed responsibility for the campaign on the CL0P^\_\- LEAKS DLS. The first PoC 
was made publicly available three days later, on June 9, 2023\.

Notably, from late 2020 to 2023,20 FIN11 demonstrated a pattern of exploiting 
vulnerabilities in four different file transfer applications, likely because this type of 
campaign offers FIN11 several advantages. A working exploit allows FIN11 to compromise 
many targets at once. Specific targeting of file transfer software provides tactical 
advantages and supports FIN11’s business model of data theft extortion. FIN11 can obtain 
target files directly from the file transfer appliance without additional lateral movement 
into target environments, which would require time and effort on the part of the attacker 
and create more opportunities for defenders to detect the intrusion.

In the Americas in 2023, 51% of organizations first learned of a compromise from an 
external source, while 49% identified evidence of a compromise internally. This split 
appears to be consistent with a long\-term global trend toward a balance of internal versus 
external discovery. This is also consistent with observations in the Americas from 2022, 
continuing a trend toward higher rates of external notifications overall compared to 
2017–2021\. Growth in ransomware\-related intrusions over the last four years has likely 
contributed to this shift in notification source. 

Isolating ransomware\-related intrusions from all other compromises exposes a strong 
divergence in notification sources in ransomware versus non\-ransomware\-related 
intrusions. Approximately two thirds of ransomware\-related intrusions in the Americas 
were externally notified—most frequently by the attackers themselves in the form of a 
ransom note. In contrast, organizations in the region first discovered evidence of a 
compromise internally in slightly more than half of cases that were not related to 
ransomware encryption events.

Americas Median Dwell Time

In 2023, organizations located in the Americas detected intrusions at the same pace as 
in 2022\. Median dwell time in the Americas was 10 days. External parties notified these 
organizations of intrusions in 13 days, compared to 12 days in 2022\. However, when 
intrusions were detected internally, organizations uncovered malicious activity in eight 
days in 2023 compared to nine days in the previous year. 

Dwell time is calculated 
as the number of days an 
attacker is present in a 
target environment before 
they are detected. The 
median represents a value 
at the midpoint of a dataset

Dwell Time Distribution

Organizations in the Americas region continue to improve their detection capabilities. 
Organizations detected 45% of intrusions in one week or less, a rate that is similar to that 
seen in 2022\. In 68\.5% of investigations conducted by Mandiant, defenders were made 
aware of intrusions in 30 days or less, a four percentage\-point increase in investigations 
compared to 2022\. 

Consistent with trends seen globally, organizations continue to identify intrusions that had 
remained undetected for longer periods of time. Organizations located in the Americas 
region saw a small increase in intrusions detected in five years or less and a decrease in 
intrusions that were undetected for more than five years.

Organizations located in the Americas detected overall intrusions related to ransomware in 
six days compared to five days seen in the previous M\-Trends reporting period. This could 
be explained by the slight increase in investigations involving ransomware, or it could be 
a slight variation in the ransomware attackers’ ability to conduct operations. In intrusions 
related to ransomware, targeted organizations detected malicious activity internally in 
seven days, compared to six days when an external party made organizations aware of 
an intrusion. 

In intrusions that did not involve ransomware, internal detection remained the fastest 
way for organizations to be notified of an intrusion, with a dwell time of eight days. When 
they did not detect an intrusion internally, organizations in the Americas were notified of 
intrusions within a median of 19 days by an external party.

Organizations in the Americas faced threats similar to those experienced by organizations 
across the globe. In 41% of intrusions that had an initial infection vector identified, an 
exploit was the source of attacker activity in the region. Phishing was used as an initial 
vector in 18% of intrusions. Rounding out the top three, attackers leveraged prior 
compromised access gained from another threat group or malware in 14% of intrusions.

Threat Groups 
Prevalent Threat Group Targeting Americas

The most frequently observed attacker in the Americas in 2023 was FIN11, a financially 
motivated threat group. The majority of FIN11 intrusions Mandiant investigated were 
related to the widespread campaign exploiting CVE\-2023\-34362 in the MOVEit Transfer 
secure managed file transfer (MFT) software.21 Mandiant also investigated intrusions in 
which FIN11 exploited CVE\-2023\-0669 in GoAnywhere MFT. Although FIN11 has deployed 
the CLOP ransomware in the past, in these campaigns the attacker focused on data theft 
extortion with no ransomware encryption. Counts of listings from the CL0P^\_\- LEAKS DLS 
corroborate Mandiant’s investigative findings and demonstrate the scale FIN11 was able to 
achieve through these focused vulnerability exploitation campaigns.

JAPAC saw little movement in the volume of ransomware\-related intrusions, with a 
small increase to 33% of investigations conducted in the region in 2023\. However, dwell 
time for ransomware\-related intrusions declined to three days compared to 19 days in 
2022\. This sharp decrease is likely a cause of the quick moving ransomware families 
used in intrusions over the years. Mandiant has observed ransomware\-related intrusions 
balance speed and thoroughness of compromise. Attackers who deploy ransomware want 
to move fast enough to reduce the chance of detection, but also be meticulous enough 
to ensure potential damage that is sufficient to increase the likelihood of maximum 
ransom payment. 

Organizations detected non\-ransomware\-related intrusions quicker in 2023 in slightly 
more than half the time observed in 2022\. The median dwell time in the JAPAC region for 
non\-ransomware\-related intrusions was 26 days in 2023\. Organizations were notified of 
an intrusion in six days by an internal security product or team member. Externally, 
however, organizations were notified of an intrusion 37 days after the malicious activity 
initially began.

Targeted Attacks
Initial Infection Vector

Mandiant investigators identified that organizations in JAPAC were impacted by exploits 
in 39% of investigations when an initial infection vector was identified. In nearly a fifth 
(18%) of investigations, attackers leveraged brute\-force techniques to gain initial access 
in the region. Rounding out the top three most seen initial infection vectors in the region 
was the use of access obtained by a prior compromise. In 15% of intrusions, Mandiant 
investigators identified evidence that an attacker leveraged access originally obtained by 
another attacker through either purchased access or by leveraging unsecured backdoor 
access. The increase in prior compromise usage is likely representative of the inner 
workings of the criminal ransomware ecosystem.

Threat Groups
Prevalent Threat Group Targeting JAPAC

In the Japan and Asia Pacific region in 2023, Mandiant investigators most often 
encountered suspected Chinese cyber espionage cluster UNC4841\. 

Beginning in at least October 2022, UNC4841 exploited a zero\-day vulnerability, CVE\-2023\-
2868, in Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances in a campaign targeting 
public and private organizations worldwide.22 In several cases, Mandiant observed 
evidence of UNC4841 searching for and exfiltrating data relevant to Chinese political or 
strategic interests. In the set of entities that UNC4841 selected for focused data theft, 
Mandiant uncovered shell scripts that targeted email domains and users from Ministries 
of Foreign Affairs of ASEAN member nations as well as individuals within foreign trade 
offices and academic research organizations in Taiwan and Hong Kong.

In this campaign, UNC4841 took a number of steps to disguise its activity. For example, 
it inserted malware in or used the names of legitimate Barracuda modules and phishing 
messages that were designed to be intercepted by spam filters and avoid further 
investigation by security teams. Notably, after the initial vulnerability disclosure and 
remediation efforts, UNC4841 responded aggressively, rapidly altering its malware, 
deploying additional persistence mechanisms, and moving laterally to maintain access to 
target environments. Further analysis on this can be found in Attacker Operations Involving 
Zero\-Days Vary Depending on Motivation.

EMEA Median Dwell Time

Organizations in EMEA detected intrusions in 22 days in 2023 compared to 20 days in 
2022\. Dwell time for intrusions detected externally decreased to just under two weeks, at 
12 days in 2023 compared to 18 seen in 2022\. Organizations detected intrusions internally 
in 23 days in 2023 compared to 33 days in 2022\.

EMEA Median Dwell Time, 2016\-2023

Over the years, dwell time has varied across detection sources in EMEA. The general trend 
shows that median dwell time continues to decrease year over year, with median dwell 
time in 2022 resulting in the shortest time period seen in the region. The small variation 
seen in 2023 could be the result of regional data normalizing, following the notable portion 
of Mandiant’s work in Ukraine in 2022\.

Dwell Time Distribution

This year in EMEA, organizations saw intrusions go undetected for longer periods of time 
compared to previous years, with 14% of investigations conducted in the region remaining 
undetected for up to five years. However, in 2023, organizations saw less than 1% of 
investigations go undetected for more than five years.

Organizations working with Mandiant in EMEA saw ransomware\-related intrusions return 
to a volume previously seen in 2021\. Nearly a quarter of the investigations conducted in 
the region were ransomware\-related, 22% in 2023 compared to 7% in 2022\. 

The median dwell time for ransomware\-related intrusions decreased in the region. 
Ransomware intrusions were detected in little more than one week, with eight days 
compared to 33 days in 2022\. Internal detection of ransomware intrusions in EMEA took 3 
days, compared to 20 days for external notifications. 

Intrusions not related to ransomware were detected in 31 days in 2023, compared to 19 
days in 2022\. Non\-ransomware\-related intrusions remain undetected for longer periods of 
time if they are detected by an internal source.

Initial Infection Vector

In EMEA, Mandiant investigators noted intrusions began with an exploit in 36% of 
intrusions when an initial infection vector was identified. Organizations in EMEA also faced 
attackers abusing prior access in 21% of intrusions and phishing in 16% of intrusions. 

Threat Groups
Prevalent Threat Group Targeting EMEA

Mandiant investigated a variety of intrusions in EMEA in 2023, including compromises 
attributed to UNC4393\. UNC4393 is a financially motivated threat cluster that has 
monetized access by deploying BASTA ransomware. This cluster does not work alone 
but rather relies on other attackers to obtain initial access into target environments. 
Throughout most of 2023, Mandiant found that UNC2500 and UNC2633 QAKBOT 
infections consistently preceded UNC4393 activity in target environments. In August 2023, 
an international law enforcement effort disrupted the QAKBOT botnet,23 which forced 
UNC2500 to shift to alternative malware payloads to continue operations. Starting in mid\-
September 2023, Mandiant observed UNC2500 begin distributing DARKGATE payloads, 
which UNC4393 leveraged to ultimately deploy BASTA ransomware.

Mandiant regularly observes evidence that multiple attackers were involved in different 
stages of a compromise, and prior compromise was the third most common initial access 
vector for 2023 Mandiant incident responses. The complexity of multi\-attacker intrusions 
and the speed with which attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) evolve 
underscores the importance of implementing defense\-in\-depth strategies to minimize the 
impact of an attacker gaining a foothold in an environment.

Chinese Espionage Operations 
Targeting The Visibility Gap

Endpoint detection and response (EDR) platforms have become commonplace among companies seeking to expand the visibility 
into endpoint activity necessary to provide a baseline of security monitoring. This increase in visibility has forced attackers to 
evolve in order to maintain operational efficacy. While some attackers have invested in EDR bypass techniques, others have, 
instead, chosen to focus on areas of the corporate environment where in\-depth visibility remains uncommon. While EDR agents 
have become a standard part of security deployments, many specialized appliances that either segment or host assets critical to 
the organization often lack similar levels of visibility. These systems have become a new preferred safe haven for attackers as it 
enables them to maintain long\-term persistence with lower risk of detection due to the gap in visibility.

Common examples of devices that rarely support EDR deployment are firewalls, email filtering products, virtualization platforms, 
and virtual private network (VPN) solutions. To further complicate matters, the platforms on which these appliances are built 
may be proprietary or otherwise locked down, such that forensic analysis efforts are hindered. Exploits for these devices are 
exceedingly valuable to attackers, primarily because they typically require no user interaction to succeed, which helps to minimize 
the chance of detection. If an attacker possesses an exploit for a zero\-day vulnerability on these devices, they are often able to 

Zero\-day: Vulnerabilities 
disclosed before patches are 
made available.

N\-day: Vulnerabilities first 
exploited after patches were 
made available.

gain access to a target environment and remain undetected for an extended period of 
time. Furthermore, the attacker can use the exploit to gain access to additional targets or 
reestablish access to the same target if it is disrupted. 

Mandiant observed a range of attackers targeting devices that matched this profile in 2023\. 
Sandworm24 continued to leverage access via compromised network edge infrastructure to 
enable their wartime operations in Ukraine. The financially motivated group FIN1125 exploited 
a zero\-day in MOVEit Transfer software to steal data as part of their data theft extortion 
operations. In the past year alone, Mandiant has investigated several high\-profile cases of 
suspected Chinese espionage operations leveraging zero\-day and n\-day vulnerabilities to 
target systems where visibility has been difficult to instrument. 

Custom Malware for 
Edge Devices

Security and networking devices that sit at the logical 
perimeter of a network and host services on the internet are 
often referred to as “edge devices.” Mandiant has observed 
a trend in which China\-nexus attackers have gained access 
to edge devices via exploitation of vulnerabilities, particularly 
zero\-days, and subsequently deployed custom malware 
ecosystems. These malware ecosystems have typically 
consisted of several distinct code families that attackers 
operate in unison, and are usually custom developed or tailored 
for the target edge device and underlying operating system. 
Developing malware for these managed appliances is a non\-
trivial task. Vendors typically do not enable direct access to 
the operating system or filesystem for appliance device 
owners or users. In order to operationalize attacks within this 
class of platform, attackers must maintain a resource intensive 
malware development lifecycle that, by necessity, maintains 
flexibility and a high degree of technical acumen. While this 
process requires a substantial investment, it also produces 
clear results when leveraged successfully by attackers.

Remaining Undetected 

In general, custom malware may go undetected for long 
periods of time since there is unlikely to be specific detections 
in place for the malware. This is particularly true for edge 
devices, where network defenders may have little to no means 
for monitoring and detection of malware activity. Malware 
authors may also take special care to ensure that the malware 
hinders forensic investigation by circumventing or clearing 
logging systems in place on the device. Even after the malware 
has been discovered and exposed by the security community, 
it is often a non\-trivial task for a device owner to identify if 
they have been impacted, since off\-the\-shelf security products 
typically will not support edge devices. Furthermore, it is 
sometimes the case that exploitation attempts of zero\-day 
vulnerabilities leave little or no reliable evidence behind. 
This is often exacerbated by the fact that the attack may have 
occurred months or even years prior to detection. Additionally, 
there are often challenges with traditional forensic techniques 
as these devices are typically kept under tight control by 
manufacturers, adding to the already complex nature of 
investigating these types of compromises. 

Special Report: Mandiant M\-Trends 202462

Example: BOLDMOVE

Example: THINCRUST

BOLDMOVE is a backdoor used by suspected Chinese 
espionage groups that has both Windows and Linux variants 
containing a core set of features. Mandiant identified a custom 
variant of the Linux version of BOLDMOVE, which contained 
an extended set of features to remain undetected on Fortinet 
devices. This variant of BOLDMOVE disabled the \`miglogd\` and 
\`syslogd\` logging daemons on the appliance, and contained 
a command to patch memory address space for these 
logging functions.These customizations of the BOLDMOVE 
backdoor are suspected to have enabled the attacker to remain 
undetected for a longer period of time than they would have 
otherwise been able to through traditional means. 

Reduced Complexity, 
Increased Reliability

Edge devices such as email security gateway appliances and 
VPNs are typically high\-availability devices that run for months 
or years at a time without being rebooted. As such, many of 
these devices are put through rigorous testing regimes by the 
manufacturer during development to ensure their stability. 
China\-nexus malware developers take advantage of the 
built\-in functionality included in these systems, which benefits 
them in several ways. In general, leveraging native capabilities 
will enable attackers to reduce the overall complexity of the 
malware by instead weaponizing existing features within that 
have been rigorously tested by the organization. For example, 
for devices that use proprietary software components such 
as custom file formats or configuration files, attackers may 
be able to leverage built\-in functions to parse or process 
these files rather than developing their own implementation. 
This concept is analogous to living\-off\-the\-land, and is 

Living off the land: Attacker 
use of legitimate, pre\-installed 
tools and software within a 
target environment, notably to 
evade detection.

particularly effective 
on edge devices since 
these native device 
operations are likely 
not being monitored 
 by network defenders 
and, as such, may 
go unnoticed. 

During an UNC3886 compromise, Mandiant discovered a 
backdoor deployed to FortiAnalyzer and FortiManager devices 
named THINCRUST, which disguised its command and control 
(C2\) communications as legitimate API calls to the devices. 
UNC3886, a suspected Chinese espionage group, appended the 
Python\-based backdoor code into legitimate web framework 
files that were responsible for providing the API interface for 
the appliance. This gave UNC3886 the ability to harness the 
native API implementation to access and send commands to 
THINCRUST by simply interacting with a new endpoint URL, which 
they had added. By leveraging existing capabilities built into the 
appliance, UNC3886 was able to simplify their malware while 
maintaining the reliability necessary for continued operations.

Tailored Capabilities and 
Smaller Footprint

Custom malware for edge devices may only include the 
capabilities required to achieve the attacker’s mission 
objectives. Malware used to exploit vulnerabilities may never be 
used again once the vulnerabilities are discovered and patched, 
as the cost to maintain and repurpose the code often outweighs 
the benefits. By developing relatively simple malware that serves 
only to provide the attackers with the desired functionality on 
the target device, attackers are able to achieve their goals 
while minimizing their overall footprint. In the same vein, the 
requirement for complex obfuscation is likely lessened since 
the primary objective of the attacker is to remain undetected 
entirely, rather than hinder the analysis of the malware once it 
has been discovered. By the time the malware is discovered, the 
vulnerability and campaign would have already been exposed, 
and the attacker’s operations typically come to a close.

Example: TABLEFLIP

After losing access to a FortiManager device during one 
incident due to access control lists change, UNC3886 adapted 
to the situation by deploying a network traffic redirection utility 
named TABLEFLIP. TABLEFLIP passively listens on all active 
interfaces for specialized command packets that contain an 
XOR encoded IP address and port to redirect traffic to using 
iptables commands. UNC3886 deployed TABLEFLIP alongside 
the publicly available REPTILE rootkit to act as a reverse shell, 
and successfully gained access back to the FortiManager 
device. The ability to produce purpose\-built malware in response 
to changes in an ongoing operation places defenders at a 
disadvantage when facing capable and agile attackers with 
nation\-state backing.

Attribution Challenges

Custom malware developed for edge devices may stifle 
attribution for cyber threat intelligence analysts. These 
malware families, and potentially the entire ecosystem, 
could be almost entirely unique when compared to existing 
malware because of the target operating system and tailored 
capabilities. As such, they may not contain code or other 
overlaps analysts traditionally find between related malware 
families that contribute to the technical attribution analysis. 

Example: SEASPRAY and WHIRLPOOL

SEASPRAY is a launcher written in Lua that UNC4841 injected 
into legitimate Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) 
modules. SEASPRAY registers an event handler for incoming 
emails, and launches an external binary, which Mandiant 
tracks as WHIRLPOOL, when certain markers are present. 
WHIRLPOOL is a simple TLS reverse shell utility that receives 
a C2 IP address and port to connect to from SEASPRAY 
at runtime. Because SEASPRAY was a relatively simple 
implementation that consisted of a few lines of code that 
were specific to the Barracuda ESG appliances, it did not offer 
much value in terms of attribution. Similarly, WHIRLPOOL was 
a simple and generic TLS reverse shell that did not contain 
any embedded C2 server information that could be analyzed. 
Usage of such malware on edge devices presented significant 
challenges for analysts performing attribution analysis. 

Mandiant has observed several instances where China\-nexus 
attackers demonstrated a high level of in\-depth knowledge when 
targeting edge devices. The degree of knowledge spanned not 
only the malware used during the attack, but also the zero\-day 
vulnerabilities used to gain access to these devices. 

Example: DEPTHCHARGE

DEPTHCHARGE is a passive backdoor that Mandiant observed 
UNC4841 begin to deploy about one week after Barracuda’s 
initial public notification of the ESG zero\-day campaign. 
This was followed by more rapid deployment to what 
Mandiant assessed were high\-value targets, once Barracuda 
announced plans to replace affected devices. The timing of 
the accelerated deployment suggests that UNC4841 may have 
anticipated this, and was prepared for remediation efforts 
with tooling and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) 
designed to enable them to continue operations in the face of 
attempts to disrupt their access to target networks. 

Several aspects of DEPTHCHARGE and its execution chain 
demonstrated an intimate knowledge of the Barracuda 
ESG device and its software components. Most notable 
was that the attacker had identified a method for malware 
persistence inside the configuration database for the 
appliance, which would result in it being present in exported 
backup configurations. This meant that device owners looking 
to set up a clean device would unknowingly export backup 
configurations containing DEPTHCHARGE persistence, and 
in\-turn infect their clean appliances when attempting to 
restore their configuration. 

Perhaps an even more intricate display of UNC4841’s 
knowledge of the inner workings of the appliance was the 
method through which DEPTHCHARGE achieved command 
execution from a trigger inside the MySQL configuration 
database after it had been imported. UNC4841 understood 
that completely separate components of the ESG’s codebase 
accessed files using the two\-argument form of Perl’s open() 
function, and that they could craft a special filename that 
would result in commands being executed on the appliance. 
By having the MySQL trigger drop a file that induces this 
command execution, UNC4841 was able to chain these 
techniques together to have DEPTHCHARGE dropped and 
executed upon import of a backup configuration on a new 
appliance. This effectively enabled UNC4841 to survive 
through a complete device replacement in the small number 
of cases where this occurred.

Custom Malware for 
Hypervisors

As cloud computing has grown in popularity over the years, 
hypervisors have subsequently become commonplace 
within modern infrastructures. However, while instrumenting 
endpoint visibility on the guest virtual machines is relatively 
easy, instrumenting visibility on the hypervisor itself can 
present substantial challenges. As with network edge devices, 
Type 1 hypervisors commonly run on operating systems 
versions that are rarely supported by EDR vendors. Not 
surprisingly, given the low visibility yet excessively high target 
value of a hypervisor, Mandiant has observed China\-nexus 
attackers targeting hypervisors as well. 

Hypervisor technologies, such as VMware’s ESXi, use Virtual 
Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) sockets to facilitate 
communication between the bare\-metal host and the guest 
operating systems. Mandiant has observed attackers leverage 
VMCI sockets for lateral movement and continued persistence 
within targeted environments. UNC3886 utilized backdoors 
such as VIRTUALPITA, and took advantage of VMCI\-based 
channels to communicate from the ESXi host to the guest 
virtual machines (VM). Since the traffic over the virtualized 
layer is localized to the bare metal machine, there are no 
security mechanisms restricting any guest VM or ESXi host 
from initiating a connection with the other, essentially 
bypassing any network segmentation. Additionally, traffic 
cannot be monitored outside of the guest VMs and ESXi 

hosts present in the virtualized environment. While the client/
server communication socket has connection\-oriented and 
connectionless variants very similar to TCP and UDP, it is 
invisible to commonly used networking tools such as tcpdump, 
netstat, nmap, and Wireshark without custom configurations, 
as it belongs to a different socket address family. 

UNC3886 used a novel persistence technique to deploy the 
VIRTUALPITA backdoor using vSphere Installation Bundles 
(“VIBs”). Mandiant had not previously observed this technique 
for deploying malware or persistence, which suggests 
UNC3886 spent significant resources to understand the 
inner workings of VMware technologies, especially the VMCI 
sockets for circumventing security restrictions. Furthermore, 
VIRTUALPITA was used to pass arbitrary commands to guest 
VMs without being logged on the host. These commands then 
get executed on the guest VM with the vmtoolsd.exe process 
where they are then observed in the Windows event logs. 
VIRTUALPITA also sets the HISTFILE to 0, which would remove 
any terminal history on the host system, leaving behind little 
forensics evidence.

Recommendations

Outlook

Despite the amount of resourcing required, Chinese espionage 
groups are almost certainly going to continue investing in the 
acquisition of zero\-day exploits and platform\-specific tooling. 
Mandiant expects that we will continue to see targeting of 
edge devices and platforms that traditionally lack EDR and 
other security solutions due to the challenges associated with 
discovery and investigation of compromise. Exploitation of 
these devices will continue to be an attractive initial access 
vector for Chinese espionage groups to remain undetected and 
maintain persistence into target environments.

It is also likely that we will continue to see the deployment 
of custom malware ecosystems by Chinese espionage 
groups that are tailored for the device and operation at hand. 
This approach provides several advantages such as the 
increased ability to remain undetected, reduced complexity 
and increased reliability, and a reduced malware footprint. 
Additionally, it presents challenges to technical attribution 
being performed by threat intelligence analysts. 

Organizations must remain vigilant and ensure that they’re 
not only monitoring their networks at the operating system 
layer, but also continue to patch, maintain and, where possible, 
monitor the appliances that are running the underlying 
infrastructure of their networks. 

The most critical strategy for protecting against such attacks 
is maintaining proper patch management to mitigate the risk 
of exploitation of known vulnerabilities. Applying the most 
recent patch is the best way to limit any unexpected tampering 
or modification of the appliance. For zero\-day vulnerabilities, 
where exploitation is unlikely to be detected, a defense\-in\-depth 
approach provides the best chances of surfacing evidence of 
the malicious activity further in the attack lifecycle. 

If an organization has identified that they were operating 
vulnerable devices and may have been compromised, 
Mandiant recommends performing an investigation and 
hunting activities within their networks. An investigation 
may include, but is not limited to, the following:

• Scanning potentially impacted devices with publicly 

available tools such as IOC scanners to identify evidence 
of compromise.

• Sweeping the entire environment for known IOCs.

• Reviewing network logs for signs of data theft and lateral 

movement.

• Reviewing network logs for abnormal logins or internal 

traffic from edge devices.

• Capturing a forensic image of the impacted appliance and 

conducting a forensic analysis.

• Applying any malware signatures (e.g. YARA rules) to 
appliance images to assist forensic investigators.

Organizations should also consider implementation of security 
controls detailed in architecture hardening guidance provided 
by security vendors. Mandiant has previously provided such 
documentation for the Barracuda ESG event.26

Attacker Operations Involving Zero\-Days 
Vary Depending on Motivation

In the ever\-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, zero\-day exploits remain a potent weapon 
in the hands of attackers. These vulnerabilities, unknown to software vendors, can provide 
attackers with a stealthy means to gain unauthorized access to systems and sensitive data.

Zero\-day: Vulnerabilities 
disclosed before patches 
are made available.

In 2023, we tracked a combined total of 97 unique zero\-day vulnerabilities exploited in\-the\-wild, 
surpassing the volume tracked in 2022 by nearly 56%. People’s Republic of China (PRC) cyber espionage groups were the most 
prolific attackers to exploit zero\-days in 2023, and demonstrated a focus on stealth in their zero\-day exploitation campaigns. The 
state\-sponsored groups tracked by Mandiant primarily utilize zero\-days for intelligence gathering and strategic advantage.

Another consistent component of cyber espionage 
exploitation has been the rise of commercial commercial 
surveillance vendors selling what are often turnkey or off\-the\-
shelf capabilities. In many instances, these vendors offer not 
just the technical expertise to build an exploit chain, but also 
the subsequent tools necessary to identify and exfiltrate data 
from the targeted victim. The growth of these capabilities 
suggests internal expertise is no longer required to exploit 
zero\-day vulnerabilities. This expands the access to zero\-
day exploits for attackers, even if they lack the technical 
sophistication to conduct zero\-day research.

At the same time, financially motivated attackers have 
continued to embrace zero\-days, aiming to infiltrate systems 
and steal valuable data for financial gain. During 2023, 
financially motivated attackers and espionage groups appear 
to represent roughly the same proportion of total zero\-
days exploited as they had in the previous two years. FIN11, 
a financially motivated group active since at least 2016, 
exploited two zero\-days in 2023 in widespread campaigns. 
FIN11’s investment in developing zero\-days demonstrates their 
continued sophistication. Zero\-day vulnerability research is a 
time and resource intensive process, and FIN11’s exploitation 
of multiple zero\-day vulnerabilities indicates the group has 
consistent access to both. Notably, FIN11 has frequently 
targeted file transfer applications, which can provide quick 
and efficient access to large amounts of sensitive data 
without the need for lateral movement within a victim network. 

The diverse motivations of attackers translate into distinct 
approaches to the utilization of zero\-day exploits. Espionage 
groups prioritizing stealth and long\-term access may employ 
zero\-days sparingly, and meticulously craft exploits to 
minimize detection. Financially motivated attackers, on the 
other hand, often prioritize speed and efficiency, potentially 
sacrificing stealth for quicker returns and wider exploitation.

Two case studies, derived from frontline Mandiant 
engagements, exemplify the varying behavior of attackers 
when driven by distinct objectives. The financially motivated 
campaign that exploited Progress Software’s MOVEit Transfer 
demonstrates the adaptability and speed of financially 
motivated attackers. In contrast, the espionage\-driven 
campaign that targeted the Barracuda Email Security Gateway 
(ESG) highlights the persistence and sophistication of state\-
sponsored groups. These case studies exemplify the varied 
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of two groups 
that have distinctly different objectives, but prosecute those 
objectives with similar ingenuity and adaptability.

Cybercrime Campaign 
Case Study: MOVEit

In May 2023, Mandiant observed the exploitation of CVE\-2023\-
34362,27 a zero\-day vulnerability in Progress’s managed file 
transfer solution MOVEit Transfer. This vulnerability, affecting 
all MOVEit Transfer versions prior to May 31, 2023, allowed 
attackers to gain unauthorized access to MOVEit Transfer’s 
database, potentially leading to data breaches and financial 
losses. To exploit CVE\-2023\-34362, the attacker had to send 
a specially crafted request to a vulnerable server, which 
injected malicious SQL statements into application queries on 
the vulnerable systems. After gaining access to a vulnerable 
application’s database, the attacker could perform additional 
actions to gain elevated privileges and execute arbitrary 
code, including accessing, modifying or deleting data within 
the database. Mandiant investigated 31 attacks related to 
this vulnerability, providing valuable insights into the TTPs 
employed by FIN11, to which we’ve attributed all exploitation. 
Mandiant’s analysis revealed a pattern of automated attacks, 
during which FIN11 appeared to focus on speed and efficiency 
of exploitation. FIN11’s approach to campaigns has evolved 
to become more sophisticated, and pose greater risks to 
targeted organizations.

Special Report: Mandiant M\-Trends 202467

FIN11’s Attack Campaign

FIN11 emerged as the key player exploiting the MOVEit 
Transfer zero\-day. Mandiant’s investigations revealed that 
FIN11 began testing the vulnerability as early as April 2022\. 
However, public reporting indicates testing might have begun 
even earlier. Testing likely continued until a reliable exploit and 
means for data exfiltration was developed.

Beginning in May 2023, FIN11’s attack methodology primarily 
involved the deployment of web\-based backdoors, data 
enumeration, and data theft. Upon gaining initial access, 
FIN11 deployed a web\-based backdoor, which Mandiant 
tracks as LEMURLOOT, on compromised systems. These 
backdoors masqueraded as legitimate software components, 
and provided functionality for the enumeration and theft of 
data. FIN11 executed commands through LEMURLOOT to 
enumerate files and folders, retrieve configuration information, 
and create or delete a user with a hard\-coded name.

Impact and Remediation

Nearly 2,600 organizations across various sectors and 
industries were targeted by FIN11 during this campaign. 
The scale of the attacks further indicates that FIN11 relied on 
automated methods, as it would be impractical for them to 
engage in hands\-on\-keyboard intrusions on such a broad scale. 
Based on data posted on the FIN11 data leak site , FIN11 stole 
terabytes of potentially sensitive data during their campaign.

Mandiant did not identify evidence of lateral movement during 
any of the investigations related to FIN11’s use of the MOVEit 
Transfer vulnerability. It is likely that FIN11’s primary objective 
was the immediate theft of data rather than establishing long\-
term persistence or compromising additional systems within 
the target networks. Access to file transfer appliances likely 
provided FIN11 with sufficient access to sensitive data they 
could use to extort victims without needing to move laterally in 
the network.

Remediation efforts surrounding FIN11’s targeting of MOVEit 
Transfer appliances involved applying a sequence of patches 
released by Progress Software. Organizations were urged 
to prioritize patching and to implement robust cybersecurity 
measures to safeguard against similar attacks.

Espionage Campaign 
Case Study: Barracuda

PRC cyber espionage groups conducted multiple high\-profile 
zero\-day exploitation campaigns in 2023\. One of the most 
notable, and likely the most widespread, was a campaign 
targeting Barracuda ESG appliances.28 UNC4841, a cluster of 

Chinese cyber espionage activity, targeted Barracuda ESGs 
through a remote command injection vulnerability (CVE\-2023\-
2868\), which was publicly disclosed in May 2023\. However, 
Mandiant investigations identified evidence of exploitation 
dating back to at least October 2022\. UNC4841 exploited ESG 
appliances by taking advantage of a flaw in the parsing logic for 
processing of TAR files. By formatting TAR files in a particular 
way, UNC4841 was able to trigger a remote command injection 
attack that enabled them to execute system commands. 
UNC4841 carefully crafted their attack strategy, employing 
emails cleverly designed to appear as low quality spam, and 
including malicious TAR archive attachments. The filenames 
included in the TAR archive email attachments contained 
malicious commands, which were leveraged to establish 
a foothold on vulnerable appliances. After gaining access, 
UNC4841 deployed a wide range of second\-stage backdoors 
specifically tailored to Barracuda ESGs to establish long\-term 
access, enabling them to conduct their espionage activities 
undetected for more than eight months.

Stealing Sensitive Data with Precision

With long\-term access firmly established, UNC4841 focused 
on quietly stealing sensitive data from targeted organizations. 
Their tactics centered on harvesting email from the ESG’s 
temporary mail storage component, which enabled them to 
conduct broad email collection on compromised appliances. 
UNC4841 also targeted email collection through shell scripts, 
which targeted specific email domains and users deemed to 
be of strategic importance to China. Additionally, Mandiant 
observed UNC4841 targeting email being sent to Barracuda 
appliances for collection as they may originate from sources 
of particular intelligence value. The staging file naming 
conventions utilized by UNC4841 throughout the campaign 
were indicative of a large\-scale espionage operation. 
UNC4841 primarily staged data in the /mail/tmp/ directory 
and utilized a consistent file naming convention containing 
three letters corresponding to the victim organization followed 
by a number.

Targeting Trends

UNC4841’s targeting patterns evolved over the campaign, 
which lasted longer than eight months. While initially 
focusing on government organizations, as the campaign 
progressed, UNC4841 expanded their reach to include 
organizations in the information technology sector, as well 
as a wide range of others. After the public notification of the 
vulnerability, UNC4841 prioritized government agencies and 
high\-tech organizations for deployment of specific malware 
families. UNC4841 deployed a series of backdoors across 
organizations in the post notification period in order to 
maintain access and continue operation. 

Special Report: Mandiant M\-Trends 202468

Mitigating the Threat

On May 31, 2023, Barracuda strongly advised organizations 
to replace all compromised ESGs immediately regardless 
of patch level. This incident underscores the importance 
of proactive cybersecurity measures, including prompt 
vulnerability patching, regular security audits, and continuous 
monitoring of networks for attempted lateral movement or 

suspicious activity stemming from edge appliances. While 
defenders cannot anticipate a zero\-day, these measures can 
help expose other security flaws that could allow an attacker 
to more easily move throughout a network or escalate 
privileges. Limiting the damage and breadth of an attack from 
undisclosed vulnerabilities helps limit the risks organizations 
face as attackers evolve.

A Comparative Analysis: Lessons Learned and the 
Evolving Threat Landscape

The campaigns targeting MOVEit Transfer and Barracuda ESG vulnerabilities highlight the evolving threat landscape, and the 
stark differences between how financially motivated and espionage\-driven attackers operationalize the use of zero\-day exploits. 
FIN11 prioritized a fast and efficient approach to its exploitation of MOVEit, targeting a large number of organizations for brief but 
efficient access to sensitive data.

Meanwhile, UNC4841 exhibited a more meticulous and 
targeted approach during its Barracuda ESG exploitation, 
seeking long\-term, surreptitious access to sensitive data for 
intelligence purposes.

The means through which various attackers have historically 
acquired and leveraged zero\-day exploits should inform the 
decision\-making and prioritization for organizations that may 
become future targets. While there is no reliable way to defend 
against zero\-day exploits, organizations can mitigate risk 
by working to protect and segregate critical systems, while 
also ensuring they have the visibility needed for continued 
monitoring of suspicious activity.

Organizations traditionally prioritize patching by risk scores, 
with a higher risk score often getting patched prior to 
those with lower risk scores. However, evidence of active 
exploitation of a vulnerability should escalate patching 
priority,29 and affected organizations should launch an 
immediate investigation into impact. 

Organizations that have an existing incident response plan 
and broad environmental monitoring are often better prepared 
to assess the potential impact of a vulnerability on their 
environment. Layering network segmentation and logging 
with advanced endpoint detection and response solutions 
provides organizations with an efficient means through which 
investigations can be started and brought to a swift close.

Similarly, thoroughly evaluating the security practices and 
network requirements for vendors prior to deploying hardware 
or software into the environment allows defenders to build a 
quality baseline of what should be considered “normal” use. 
Vendor vetting also allows for the creation of comprehensive 
detection mechanisms as the definition of non\-standard 
use is clarified. Any detections for non\-standard use within 
the context of a vendor’s product should be prioritized and 
investigated to ensure the legitimacy of the actions on which 
the detection fired. A blending of policy, threat intelligence, 
and active monitoring can act as an early warning system for 
attackers leveraging zero\-day vulnerabilities. 

Special Report: Mandiant M\-Trends 202469

Conclusion

Zero\-day exploitation is no longer a niche capability accessible 
to only a handful of attackers, and Mandiant anticipates 
that the growth we have seen across the last few years will 
continue. The rise of zero\-day exploitation by ransomware 
and data theft extortion groups, continued state\-sponsored 
exploitation, and the growth of turnkey or off\-the\-shelf 
capabilities that can be purchased from commercial 
commercial surveillance vendors will continue to drive the 
identification of zero\-day vulnerabilities and exploits that 
target them. By understanding the motivations and TTPs of 
attackers, organizations can build defensive strategies that 
prioritize the types of threats that are most likely to impact 
their environments. Strengthening cybersecurity posture, 
adopting robust vulnerability management practices, and 
fostering a culture of security awareness are key steps in 
safeguarding against zero\-days. The MOVEit and Barracuda 
campaigns offer a stark reminder that cyber threats are not 
merely a nuisance, but a threat that demands our attention 
and action. Defenders must adopt a proactive approach to 
cybersecurity, recognizing that zero\-day vulnerabilities are a 
reality and that preparation reduces their impact.

Evolution of Phishing Amid Shifting 
Security Controls

In 2022, Microsoft moved to block by default the execution of macros in Office documents. This change effectively impeded 
attackers’ ability to leverage this technique for code execution following initial access. Since then, Mandiant has observed 
attackers moving to adopt new methods of initial access involving expanded payload selection, and highly effective social 
engineering tactics. To circumvent security controls, attackers have begun to experiment with a variety of payload types, 
including LNK files and weaponized Microsoft Office documents. Attackers also sought to move out of the traditional bounds 
of targeting, and began to engage on platforms beyond email such as social media, SMS messaging, and other common 
communications platforms. Mandiant also observed attackers exploit trusted relationships and communications through 
techniques such as conversation hijacking, and by simply masquerading as internal users. These contemporary phishing 
techniques challenge traditional security paradigms that have focused on user education, email gateway filtering, and multi\-factor 
authentication (MFA). When targeting users in 2023, attackers leveraged multiple types of phishing payloads and techniques 
that fell outside of historical norms. Mandiant observed attackers leveraging code obfuscation, remote payload hosting, placing 
dropper scripts within archive files, and bypassing email filtering controls. 

Malware Delivery: 
Old, Borrowed, and 
New Techniques 

When targeting users in 2023, attackers leveraged multiple 
types of phishing payloads and techniques that fell outside of 
historical norms. Mandiant observed attackers leveraging code 
obfuscation, remote payload hosting, placing dropper scripts 
within archive files, and bypassing email filtering controls. 

Compressed Archive Files

Compressed archives such as the ZIP and RAR file formats 
can be used as a container for malicious dropper files, and 
provide password\-based encryption capabilities that can 
circumvent automated detection. Email security and firewall 
technologies can decompress specific archive file formats 
to perform content inspection and policy enforcement during 
file transfer. However, sandbox analysis of unencrypted 
archives may not occur rapidly enough to prevent the delivery 
of a malicious file to an end user. Similarly, archive files that 
are encrypted using password protection, in effect, bypass 
automated file scanning. Following Microsoft’s move to 
disable macros by default in 2022, Mandiant observed multiple 
threat groups shift towards the inclusion of compressed 
archives as a means to bypass initial detection. 

UNC2500 moved away from macro\-enabled Office documents 
to other file types, including OneNote and LNK files, contained 
within password\-protected ZIP archives. These files were 
commonly delivered as attachments to emails or downloaded 
from OneDrive links, Google Drive URLs, and compromised 
websites. UNC2500 phishing distribution campaigns have 

led to the deployment of multiple backdoor types following 
initial compromise, and have provided access for multiple 
attackers as a precursor to ransomware operations. Beginning 
in September 2023, the LNK files weaponized by UNC2500 
contained commands that leveraged the built\-in cURL utility 
to download and execute a Visual Basic script hosted at a 
malicious URL leading to the deployment of various backdoors.

Another threat group, UNC4814, sent spear\-phishing emails 
to government and critical infrastructure targets in Ukraine 
between April and May 2023\. These emails included 
attachments that contained an obfuscated JavaScript 
downloader. UNC4814 targeted organizations with a lure 
referencing a convention hosted by the PAX organization 
based in the Netherlands. Launching the obfuscated 
JavaScript downloader resulted in the execution of a 
PowerShell command, which installed a downloader. 

Microsoft Office Documents

When Microsoft announced their intent to block VBA Macros, 
Mandiant observed malware distribution methods shift to 
new delivery mechanisms within the ecosystem of Microsoft 
applications. Beginning in late January 2023, UNC2633 
leveraged malicious OneNote files to distribute QAKBOT 
malware. These OneNote files would drop and execute a 
Windows Script File to run additional malicious commands. 
In February, Mandiant also observed FIN6 use CV\-themed 
OneNote lures to distribute a payload consisting of a 
downloader embedded in LNK files. 

Despite Microsoft blocking office macros by default, Mandiant 
continued to observe attackers leverage Office documents 
to target users in 2023\. Continued use of malicious macros 
may reflect that some organizations maintain policies that 

Special Report: Mandiant M\-Trends 202471

keep macros enabled due to reliance on macros for legitimate 
business purposes. Since at least February 2023, the Russia\-
nexus attacker Turla, tracked by Mandiant as UNC638, has likely 
targeted Ukrainian military personnel using spear\-phishing 
emails containing Excel documents. The spreadsheets 
attached to the emails contained embedded macros to install 
a .net backdoor on targeted machines. In April 2023, UNC1151 
targeted Ukrainian government entities with a RAR archive 
containing an Excel spreadsheet with a malicious macro that 
dropped an embedded .net downloader payload. 

Hyperlinks in Email Body 
and Attachments

Mandiant has observed attackers leverage a notable technique 
in their attempts to bypass email security solutions. Instead 
of including a malicious attachment, which may be defeated 
by scanning, attackers have started to include hyperlinks to 
second\-stage payloads. In some cases the hyperlinks are 
included in innocuous attachments, whereas, in others, the 
links are included in the message bodies. Email security 
solutions vary in how far they will follow hyperlinks and the 
depth of the scanning performed.

Beginning in February 2023, Mandiant observed APT29 
conduct multiple phishing campaigns against diplomatic 
entities using hyperlinks to host second\-stage payloads. In 
one particular phishing campaign, APT29 attached a PDF 
masquerading as a wine\-tasting event invite, which contained 
a malicious embedded URL. In a separate instance targeting 
diplomatic entities, APT29 embedded the URL directly in the 
email body. Once a targeted user clicked on a URL within the 
phishing email or PDF, an HTML dropper attachment, which 
Mandiant tracks as ROOTSAW, would be downloaded to disk. 
ROOTSAW leverages HTML smuggling in order to launch 
JavaScript to decode and further execute embedded malware 
within the attachment. Beginning in October 2023, Mandiant 
observed FIN6 also leveraging this technique through social 
media phishing messages containing a resume or job\-themed 
PDF. Once a targeted user opened the PDF, the user was 
presented with a fake error message, which included a URL 
to an attacker\-controlled domain.

Social Engineering: 
Leveraging Alternative 
Platforms

and exploitation away from email and perimeter network 
monitoring, where detections are most heavily focused. 
Notably, they focused on areas where visibility is considerably 
less common, including infiltrating target environment 
communication and messaging platforms, connecting over 
social media, and phishing mobile devices. 

Communication and 
Messaging Platforms 

Mandiant observed multiple attackers attempting to send 
phishing messages to Microsoft Teams users by leveraging 
compromised internal accounts and external accounts. 
In April 2023, UNC3944 used compromised internal O365 
accounts to target other internal users over Microsoft Teams. 
The attackers pretended to be members of the organization’s 
Human Resources department in order to persuade targeted 
users to access a spoofed O365 login page hosted on a 
domain that included the name of the organization. The 
attacker provided guidance to the users on how to access the 
login form, and provide their MFA code. Once the attacker was 
authenticated as the compromised users, they registered new 
MFA methods or updated the user’s phone number used to 
receive MFA SMS codes. 

In September 2023, UNC5051 used an external O365 tenant 
account to target users with a Microsoft Teams chat request 
that contained a malicious URL. Once accessed, the user was 
prompted to download a ZIP archive stored on an attacker\-
controlled SharePoint site. The ZIP archive contained a 
LNK dropper masquerading as a PDF file that, when executed, 
launched a Visual Basic script downloader that used the built\-
in Windows cURL utility to download and execute a pre\- 
compiled AutoIT script leading to installation of the 
DARKGATE backdoor. Mandiant has identified multiple threat 
clusters incorporating the DARKGATE backdoor into their 
operations, including those that have provided initial access 
for ransomware intrusions. 

Social Media

Social media platforms provide attackers with additional 
data collection and phishing opportunities against users of 
target organizations. LinkedIn is a particularly popular choice 
for attackers, which they use to target employees of specific 
companies. Due to LinkedIn’s status as a business\-oriented 
platform and the visibility it provides into employee names, 
job titles, and responsibilities, attackers were able to build 
more plausible lures for phishing campaigns. 

As new technologies are created and deployed to defend 
against email\-based phishing, attackers have undertaken 
a natural process of identifying, trialing, and ultimately 
leveraging new platforms to deliver lures to targets. Attackers 
have employed a variety of methods to move user interaction 

In 2023, Mandiant identified multiple attackers adopting 
fake LinkedIn personas and engaging with users of target 
organizations over private messages. Beginning in May 2023, 
 UNC2970 used the LinkedIn platform to conduct spear\-
phishing operations using varied payload types, including 

Special Report: Mandiant M\-Trends 202472

container files, to compromise employees of target 
organizations. Post\-compromise activity included the 
execution of backdoors, and the targeted theft of information 
in support of suspected espionage operations. In late June 
2023, UNC4962 targeted users through LinkedIn private 
messaging using themes related to corporate development 
projects and job roles. Message recipients were directed to 
download a ZIP archive, hosted on cloud storage services, 
that contained a Visual Basic script payload. That payload 
executed a Windows Installer (MSI) package, and resulted in 
the execution of the DARKGATE backdoor. In October 2023, 
FIN6 also used the LinkedIn platform to send a URL to HR 
recruiters of a target organization, which prompted them 
to download a PDF file hosted on a fake resume site. FIN6 
restricted access to the URL using filtering requirements, 
including specific User\-Agent strings and geofencing. Users 
who met the criteria 
were served a ZIP 
archive containing a 
malicious LNK file, 
which, in turn, led to 
the instantiation of 
both a downloader 
and a backdoor.

Geofencing: Virtual boundaries 
around specific geographic 
locations that attackers will 
use to only target individuals in 
certain regions.

QR Code Phishing (“Quishing”)

Quick Response codes (QR codes) are a type of barcode 
containing encoded data, such as URLs, that can be scanned 
with mobile devices. Web browser usage on mobile devices is 
not commonly collected or monitored, which makes it difficult 
to determine when users interact with a phishing website. By 
encoding a malicious URL in a QR code image and embedding it 
within a phishing email, attackers can circumvent email security 
scanning that relies on detecting hyperlinks within the email 
message body. Users may also find it challenging to confirm 
the authenticity of a URL or web page when viewing it through 
a mobile device browser compared to a desktop browser client. 
In 2023, attackers included QR codes in phishing emails by 
embedding them within an attached PDF or image file, and 
prompting the email recipient to scan the barcode to retrieve 
information such as an invoice or a document. 

Since September 2023, Mandiant has observed UNC5103 
leveraging QR codes to direct phishing email recipients to 
websites masquerading as the State Taxation Administration 
(STA) of the People’s Republic of China. The attacker attached 
a Microsoft Word document to the phishing email that, when 
opened, would display a malicious QR code with instructions 
to begin a tax refund application. Users who visited the 
spoofed STA website from a mobile device were prompted 
to provide personal information, including name, personal 
identification number, and bank account information.

Between September and October 2023, UNC5092 used 
compromised third\-party email accounts to send phishing 
emails with an image file containing a QR code. The QR 
code contained an encoded URL that directed the user’s 
mobile device browser to a spoofed Microsoft login page for 
credential theft. Mandiant subsequently observed UNC5092 
conducting session token theft via adversary\-in\-the\-middle 
attacks to obtain additional authentication information. 
UNC5092 leveraged the obtained cloud access to conduct 
a wide variety of activities, including registering external 
devices to enable MFA, accessing corporate email accounts 
to scrutinize data, creating new email inbox rules, acquiring 
files from SharePoint, and sending fraudulent fund transfer 
phishing emails to internal users.

SMS Phishing (“Smishing”) 

attackers can target users through SMS phishing (smishing), 
which is a technique that takes advantage of the internet\-
connected nature of mobile devices to load web content such 
as spoofed login pages for credential theft. In 2023, Mandiant 
responded to multiple incidents involving SMS phishing. 

In one October 2023 instance, a attacker, masquerading as 
Helpdesk members of a third\-party financial institution, sent 
SMS messages that directed recipients to a spoofed web 
page from their corporate systems. Users who accessed 
the malicious web page were prompted to install AnyDesk 
remote access software on their corporate systems. Once 
the attacker gained remote access to targeted systems, they 
navigated to multiple web pages related to the users’ third\-
party financial institution account with the intent of registering 
new mobile application access, and stealing money through 
funds transfers. 

Mandiant has also observed UNC3944 use SMS phishing 
campaigns against employees of targeted organizations to 
obtain credentials in order to gain and escalate access to 
the environments. Starting in mid\-2023, Mandiant identified 
UNC3944 leveraging a new phishing kit that delivers phishing 
pages designed to appear as if they belong to the targeted 
organization, and using registered domains that include the 
targeted organization name in combination with “\-sso” or 
“servicenow” in the domain. Follow\-on access by UNC3944 
has typically involved targeting of cloud resources to 
establish a foothold for data theft and monetization, but in 
2023 this attacker shifted tactics to include data extortion 
and ransomware.

Detection and Mitigation

When user credentials are successfully compromised 
through alternative platform phishing such as involving 
SMS or QR codes, the initial discovery of compromise can 
often involve cloud security alerts for risky sign\-in events, 

Special Report: Mandiant M\-Trends 202473

mailbox rule creation, suspicious MFA device registration, 
or internal and external users reporting suspicious emails 
originating from a compromised user account within the 
organization. Detection strategies may include generating 
alerts for the aforementioned activity. Platform logs may 
also record messages or URLs transmitted between users 
that could be proactively analyzed for suspicious content. 
For example, the Microsoft 365 audit log can record URLs 

sent over Microsoft Teams under the MessageURLs field 
within the MessageCreatedHasLink Operation. Common 
mitigation approaches to reduce the threat of alternative 
platform phishing include specifying which Microsoft 365 
organizations are trusted and allowed to chat with internal 
users over Microsoft Teams, deploying phishing\-resistant 
MFA methods, and other recommendations detailed within 
Microsoft security guides.30

Conclusion

Attackers have advanced the effectiveness of their techniques 
beyond the scope of what is covered by traditional anti\-phishing 
guidance. User awareness concepts such as “only interact 
with emails from trusted senders” are no longer effective 
against attackers’ use of compromised third\-party accounts, 
conversation hijacking, internal phishing, and interactive social 
engineering. User devices outside the visibility of organizations 
are also being targeted, which drives the need for implementing 

stricter technical controls for authentication, and the detection 
of suspicious access. Often, an infection chain can involve 
more than one attacker, with separate groups responsible for 
the initial phishing access and control of a backdoor, and only a 
brief overlap in operations. Having a comprehensive detection 
and threat hunting strategy focused on behavioral indicators 
across all stages of the intrusion lifecycle can lead to faster 
identification of novel initial access methods. Early detection of 
intrusion activity and rapid system containment are critical to 
limiting impact from security incidents.

How Attackers Leverage AiTM to 
Overcome MFA

Mandiant has observed an increase in compromises against cloud\-based identities configured with multi\-factor authentication 
(MFA). As the adoption of MFA becomes commonplace across organizations, attackers are becoming proficient in methodologies 
capable of overcoming weaknesses in widely\-adopted MFA methods. Most notable is the increasing adoption of web proxy or 
adversary\-in\-the\-middle (AiTM) phishing pages, which are capable of rendering most MFA implementations ineffective by stealing 
sensitive login session tokens. 

Common MFA Methods

MFA solutions often provide a variety of mechanisms for the management and approval of authentication requests. While 
mechanisms exist that are resistant to AiTM phishing, they often require additional infrastructure and overhead. However, the 
most commonly employed MFA mechanisms are the ones that are susceptible to attackers leveraging AiTM phishing. 

MFA Type

Description

Push notification

Phone call or mobile application based prompt that only requires a user to accept a phone app push 
notification or press a key on their mobile device. Push notifications often lack context about the 
resource being accessed and can enable MFA fatigue attacks, in which users are sent repeated 
requests until the prompt is approved.

One\-time password (OTP) / 
Time\-based one\-time 
password (TOTP)

Code from a SMS or email message, or a time\-bound code generated by a mobile application 
or hardware device that is input along with a username and password during or following 
authentication. SIM swapping and credential harvesting webforms are common methods of stealing 
these codes, but they are also susceptible to exposure from seed theft or takeover of an account with 
access to cloud\-synced TOTP codes.

Push notification with number 
matching verification

A push notification prompt generated on a user's mobile device that can only be accepted upon 
inputting a code generated by the logon portal. This addresses abuse mechanisms associated with 
MFA fatigue as well as TOTP code and seed theft.

Certificate\-based 
authentication (CBA)

Hardware keys

Authentication requiring X.509 certificate to be installed on devices. Resistant to AiTM phishing attacks.

Physical devices compatible with the FIDO2 or U2F standard, which use public\-key cryptography with 
supported cloud authentication services. This standard requires the server requesting a key to match 
the server tied to that key, therefore making it resistant to AiTM phishing attacks.

Special Report: Mandiant M\-Trends 202476

Credential Harvesting 
Evolved: Adversary\-in\-
the\-Middle 

Attackers often leverage credential harvesting forms, or 
phishing pages, as a means to obtain logon credentials from 
their targets. These websites, which are designed to resemble 
popular login portals, can forward to an attacker credentials 
and MFA codes submitted by the targeted user. During an 
investigation into a business email compromise, Mandiant 
observed an attacker operating a credential harvesting 
form that forwarded credentials and time\-based MFA codes 
to a private Telegram channel. This instant notification of 
stolen credentials provided the attacker an opportunity to 
successfully log in prior to the MFA code expiring, granting 
initial access into the targeted account.

AiTM phishing pages go beyond typical credential harvesting 
forms, and use infrastructure designed to overcome commonly 
implemented MFA methods. Unlike traditional credential 
harvesting forms, AiTM pages behave as a reverse web proxy 
between the targeted user and the legitimate logon portal. 
AiTM pages not only intercept credentials and MFA codes, but 
more critically, the post\-authentication session token issued 
by the logon portal. These tokens can be used by an attacker 
to bypass security controls that are only evaluated on the 
initial sign\-in.

Compared to traditional credential harvesting forms, the 
relative complexity of setting up AiTM phishing infrastructure 
may have kept its adoption by attackers limited in the past. 
However, in 2023, Mandiant observed a marked increase of 
AiTM phishing pages in use by attackers. The acceleration 
of AiTM usage amongst attackers has likely been aided 
by the availability of phishing\-as\-a\-service offerings in the 
cybercriminal underground. Such offerings can provide 
less technically sophisticated attackers access to regularly 
maintained phishing infrastructure through which they can 
launch complex campaigns.

Detection and Mitigation

While AiTM phishing represents an evolution of attacker 
capabilities in the face of stronger controls such as MFA, 
compromises through AiTM phishing pages and the ensuing 
use of stolen session tokens provides defenders with 
detection opportunities. Since AiTM phishing pages are 
designed to intercept and forward a targeted user’s login 
information to a cloud authentication service, authentication 
logs will record the IP address associated with this phishing 
infrastructure as the user’s source IP address. The attacker’s 
IP address and associated User\-Agent string, which may 
differ from the initial AiTM logon, will also be recorded when 
authenticating with a stolen token. Defenders should continue 
to monitor for anomalies, such as geographically infeasible or 
unexpected source IP addresses, and logins originating from 
data centers.

In nearly all of Mandiant’s investigations involving compromised 
cloud accounts, attackers were observed enrolling their own 
MFA methods shortly upon gaining initial access. Typically, 
this was done by interacting with a self\-service security portal. 
While this activity isn’t exclusive to AiTM attacks and session 
token theft, it’s still worth highlighting as an effective detection 
opportunity, especially if paired with other logon anomalies. 
A regular review of new MFA registrations, as well as auditing 
accounts with multiple MFA methods configured, can reveal 
events worth further investigation. 

To best defend against AiTM attacks, organizations should 
pursue a combination of AiTM\-resistant MFA methods 
and access policies. Most cloud authentication services 
support access policies that can block logons based on 
organization\-defined locations, device management status, or 
an assessment of risk based on the account’s historical logon 
properties. When implementing these access policies, it is 
important to understand which can be applied continuously 
throughout the logon session. Typically, most access policies 
are only applied at the initial token issuance stage, which will 
not offer protection against the use of previously stolen tokens.

Conclusion

As AiTM phishing pages continue to grow in prevalence, many 
organizations today still rely on security controls that do not 
offer token theft protection. Furthermore, mitigating token 
theft and stolen token usage does not presently fit into a 
single, one\-size\-fits\-all solution. Organizations can better 
protect against AiTM token theft by implementing phishing\-
resistant MFA methods and effective access policies, and 
reduce the risk of stolen token use with policies that are 
continuously evaluated during a logon session. If these 
controls are paired with effective anomaly\-based detection 
methodologies, organizations can greatly reduce the risk of 
phishing attacks and an attacker’s dwell time.

Cloud Intrusion Trends

As enterprise cloud adoption and the use of hybrid cloud/on\-premises environments continues to grow, adversaries have followed 
similarly in their targeting. Attackers recognize the value of data stored in cloud environments, and the computing resources 
available that could enable future malicious operations. Mandiant continues to observe attackers of varying motivations pivot to 
cloud environments to target cloud\-hosted data, and leverage cloud computing resources in their operations.

Targeting Identity 
and Access Management 
and Bypassing MFA 
Requirements

Historically, to gain initial access to cloud and hybrid 
environments, attackers have relied upon stolen credentials 
and access tokens that did not require multi\-factor 
authentication (MFA). As security awareness and MFA 
adoption has increased in recent years, attackers have 
placed an increasing emphasis on social engineering. During 
targeted social engineering campaigns, attackers lure users 
into providing credentials and using innovative methods to 
circumvent MFA or exploit weaknesses in its implementation.

Mandiant has observed increased usage of adversary\-in\-
the\-Middle (AiTM) techniques to bypass MFA requirements 
by capturing session tokens. In an AiTM campaign, the 
targeted user’s connection to the legitimate cloud service 
is proxied through an attacker controlled server. By doing 
so, the user’s credentials and MFA method are relayed to 
the legitimate cloud service while the attacker can capture 
the access token returned to the user. There are a number 
of AiTM kits advertised by attackers that can help automate 
the construction of convincing landing pages that mimic 
the legitimate cloud service logon page. In the majority of 
business email compromise (BEC) cases Mandiant responded 
to in 2023, successfully targeted users had MFA configured, 
but it was circumvented by an AiTM phishing campaign.

Attackers are known to leverage social engineering to target 
users, and Mandiant continues to observe the effectiveness 
of these campaigns. An espionage\-related investigation 
revealed the use of a heavily tailored spear\-phishing email that 
impersonated an individual in the same industry as the target, 
and used legitimate content relevant to the user to build 
credibility. The email lured the targeted user to click a link 
and enter their credentials to access protected information. 
Once in possession of the username and password, the 
attacker triggered a MFA push notification, which the targeted 
user accepted. 

Additionally, Mandiant observed attackers abuse the trusted 
role of help desk and technical support personnel. In one case, 
phishing messages purporting to be from technical support 
lured users into providing MFA approval for malicious signins 
to a cloud platform. In another case, the financially motivated 
attacker UNC3944 relied heavily on social engineering to 
obtain credentials of users with elevated privileges, leveraging 
SMS phishing and placing phone calls to the targeted 
organization’s help desks to reset a user’s password or 
associated MFA device.31

In 2023, we observed an increase in the use of targeted SIM 
swapping to gain access to accounts. In cases where this was 
effective, organizations sent time\-based one\-time password 
MFA codes via SMS messages. In other cases, organizations 
used SMS to verify ownership of an account before sending a 
password recovery link. Financially motivated attackers have 
been observed leveraging SIM swapping to receive both types 
of SMS codes to facilitate an account takeover. A financially\-
motivated threat cluster, UNC3786, routinely performed SIM 
swapping to compromise credentials and gain access to 
targeted organizations’ Okta and/or Microsoft 365 accounts. 
In one UNC3786 intrusion, while performing a SIM swap, the 
attacker sent spam SMS messages to the targeted user’s 
phone, likely in an attempt to distract the individual from 
notifications from their phone carrier related to the SIM swap. 
UNC3944 similarly leveraged SIM swapping to gain access to 
user credentials and SMS MFA codes.32

Mandiant continues to observe attackers perform 
password guessing attacks against cloud sign\-in portals to 
identify accounts that do not have MFA configured. Often 
organizations will rely on users to self\-enroll an MFA device. 
This means that if an account does not already have MFA, 
the first successful password authentication will immediately 
prompt to enroll an MFA device. We have seen espionage 
attackers perform these guessing attacks to find and take 
over dormant accounts without MFA that should have been 
disabled, or service accounts with no need for MFA.

Special Report: Mandiant M\-Trends 202479

Weak Credential Storage

In other cases, Mandiant observed attackers using credentials 
that were stored poorly to gain access to cloud environments. 
In one incident, default configurations on an Internet accessible 
server led to the discovery and compromise of clear text 
AWS credentials, which allowed the attacker to gain access 
to a target’s AWS environment. In another case, an attacker 
leveraged account credentials believed to have been stolen 
during a previous incident, enabling the attacker to gain access 
to the targeted organization’s cloud\-hosted code repository, 
which did not require MFA. Mandiant also responded to 
an incident involving an attacker that accessed a targeted 
organization’s AWS environment using a leaked AWS access 
key. The investigation revealed that the key likely originated 
from a Docker container, hosted on an EC2 instance and owned 
by the organization, that was exposed to the internet. Copies 
of the same key were also found in other public IP addressable 
resources not owned by the targeted organization.

Adversary Abuse of 
Cloud Services

After obtaining initial access to cloud environments, Mandiant 
observed adversaries abuse cloud native tools and services 
to maintain access, move laterally, and ultimately accomplish 
mission objectives such as stealing data. By limiting 
themselves to preinstalled tooling, attackers can decrease 
their operational profile, evade detection, and maintain 
presence in cloud environments for longer periods of time. 

Mandiant has observed attackers using Azure Data Factory 
and AirByte to modify existing pipelines to steal data stored 
in various integrated platforms such as data warehouses, 
storage blobs, and SQL databases. Specifically, attackers 
have created pipeline jobs that export data from those data 
sources to an attacker\-controlled SFTP server. The use of 
data factories provided the attackers with a stable and high\-
bandwidth platform to copy large volumes of data.33

In 2023, Mandiant observed a financially\-motivated attacker, 
UNC3944, backdoor cloud identity providers (IDP) using 
techniques that were previously only observed in use by 
espionage groups. In multiple investigations, UNC3944 gained 
administrative access to Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) to 
configure a rogue federated identity provider, which allowed 
them to execute golden SAML attacks. The attacker could 
then authenticate to resources protected by Entra ID as any 
user in the organization without knowledge of their password 
or possession of their MFA device. In one investigation, 
Mandiant observed UNC3944 target an organization’s Active 
Directory Federated Services (ADFS) server, and execute 
Mimikatz in an attempt to obtain the token signing certificate 
to conduct a golden SAML attack.

Mandiant also saw attackers target cloud compute instances 
to maintain stealthy persistence in target cloud environments. 
In multiple incidents the attackers created Azure Virtual 
Machines (VMs) and assigned them public IP addresses. 
These attacker\-created VMs did not have the organization’s 
mandated security and logging software installed on them. 
As such, the attackers gained unmonitored access to a trusted 
system inside of the organization’s virtual network or virtual 
private cloud, which they then use to progress their intrusion.34

Cloud compute instances often have network connectivity 
to organization on\-premises networks via virtual private 
network, and can provide an avenue for lateral movement. 
On multiple occasions UNC3944 moved laterally from Azure 
console access into an Azure\-hosted VM using the Special 
Administration Console to connect to VMs via serial console. 
Attackers have employed malicious use of the Serial Console 
on Azure VMs to install third\-party remote management 
software, which provided them with persistent access to the 
VM. This method of attack is unique in that it avoided many of 
the traditional detection methods employed within Azure, and 
provided the attacker with full administrative access to the VM.

Mandiant has also observed attackers target cloud 
infrastructure for the specific purposes of cryptomining based 
on their perceived significant processing power. In one incident, 
an attacker gained access to a targeted organization’s Google 
Cloud Platform (GCP) project via a leaked service account 
key. After accessing the project, the attacker deployed more 
than 1,200 virtual machines with a startup script to execute a 
Monero cryptocurrency miner using the XMR\-Stak miner.

Attackers also leveraged open\-source offensive security 
toolsets to survey the environment in some cases. Tools 
such as Pacu, an open source AWS exploitation framework, 
and CloudFox, an open source command line tool that can 
enable the discovery of exploitable attack paths into cloud 
infrastructure, were seen in one case being leveraged to 
perform automated reconnaissance. ScoutSuite, a cloud 
security and auditing tool, was used in another case to 
access AWS API and Console to conduct operations, which 
included the deployment of a cryptocurrency dataminer in 
the AWS environment.

Recommendations

Mandiant continues to observe attackers targeting weakly 
implemented identity management practices and credential 
storage to obtain legitimate credentials and circumvent 
MFA. As attackers have developed new methods to bypass 
MFA, organizations need to implement changes to their 
authentication policies to maintain a strong security posture. 
Phishing\-resistant MFA methods have gained widespread 
support by web browsers, operating systems, and cloud 
service providers. The two most commonly accepted 

Special Report: Mandiant M\-Trends 202480

Organizations should also consider implementing additional 
controls to restrict access to cloud resources to only trusted 
devices. Each CSP supports this in some form although the 
exact language may differ. This can be done by using mobile 
device management (MDM) technologies to maintain device 
state, and allow authentication only from enrolled devices. 
If organizations require access to resources using untrusted 
devices (for example, a hotel computer) they should put in 
place policies that restrict what can be accessed, and how. 
For example, users should not be able to access the cloud 
administration console from an untrusted device. Similarly, 
downloading documents on untrusted computers should be 
limited or restricted.

phishing\-resistant MFA methods are certificate\-based 
authentication (CBA) and FIDO2 security keys. Organizations 
can limit a attacker’s ability to circumvent MFA protections by 
phasing out legacy MFA methods such as SMS, phone calls, 
and TOTP codes in favor of these newer methods.

In CBA, users are provisioned a certificate identifying them 
and their device as well as a corresponding private key. The 
private key is used to prove the user’s identity to the cloud 
service provider. The user is never prompted for the private 
key, and in fact they do not know it. Almost all end\-user 
systems in use today contain a Trusted Platform Module 
(TPM), which is a separate chip that stores and manages 
cryptographic keys securely, including the private key used in 
CBA. The key material never leaves the hardware boundary 
of the TPM, so it cannot be stolen by malware on the device. 
When CBA is used, the connection is negotiated using mutual 
TLS authentication, which resists most phishing methods 
because the secret key is not known to the user, and they 
are never prompted for it. Techniques that use AiTM are also 
thwarted because when the attacker proxies a targeted user’s 
login session they must terminate the TLS connection, which 
will break CBA.

FIDO2 security keys rely on a similar security model as CBA 
to be phishing resistant, with the major distinction being the 
portability of the keys. With a FIDO2 security key, often a USB 
device, the key material never leaves the hardware boundary 
of the physical key. Users do not know and are not prompted 
for the key’s value. Each website configured for FIDO2 has 
a unique private key that is tied to a particular application. 
If a user visits a phishing website, the browser will refuse to 
prompt the user for their security key because the phishing 
domain does not match any configured keys. 

Cloud service providers (CSP) provide many tools to 
organizations to help detect and prevent common cryptominer 
schemes. First, all CSPs support authentication methods that 
provide additional security features beyond access keys and 
API secrets. Organizations should audit their cloud accounts 
and establish a program to remove any access keys, especially 
“root” or “superuser” access keys, and move towards modern 
role\-based programmatic access secrets. Additionally, 
budgeting alerts and limits are a great way to monitor cloud 
accounts for abnormal spending. This is often a high\-fidelity 
signal of a cryptocurrency scheme that has hijacked a cloud 
account. Finally, consider using a “secure by default” design 
for any new cloud environments. Secure by default bakes in 
vendor best practices to reduce the attack surface.

Artificial Intelligence in Red (and Purple) 
Team Operations

In 1955, John McCarthy, a luminary of the fields of both computer science and cognitive science, coined the term “artificial 
intelligence” to be “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.” This research started as a way to make a machine 
behave or perform like a human, but, in the modern landscape, the meaning has evolved to encompass machines that can learn 
like a human. While the artificial intelligence (AI) systems imagined in popular science fiction are still quite far off, AI is currently in 
a period of massive growth, investment, and potential. What started as logic machines with massive decision trees has expanded 
to highly complex algorithms based on myriad statistics and large\-scale compute power. Recently, the most topical of these 
algorithms are those that are designed to produce something; these systems are commonly referred to as generative AI (gen AI).

Targeted attack lifecycle: The typical 
sequence of events taken by attackers 
when conducting targeted operations.

Gen AI has captured recent interest and achievements following the release 
of multiple gen AI tools. Gen AI now creates content on scales previously 
unseen, and is assisting with fields that diverge from the purely technical 
foundations of computer science. In cybersecurity, we have seen gen AI 
revolutionize the field of detection engineering, where neural networks and 
machine learning algorithms now form the heart of a variety of detection and 

response toolsets. However, an area where we have yet to see substantial adoption, yet has the potential to yield significant gains, 
is in the field of proactive security and red team assessments. 

During a red team assessment, Mandiant experts evaluate the capabilities of a customer’s security programs by simulating real\-
world attack scenarios. Mandiant has observed that attacker usage of AI has largely been limited to the Initial Access stage of the 
Targeted Attack Lifecycle. Specifically, usage has been limited to social engineering and information operations. Mandiant’s Red 
Team has leveraged gen AI in similar fashion, seeing the greatest growth in adoption when leveraging AI to gain Initial Access to 
client environments. 

Social Engineering Pretexts 

Rapid Tool Development

One of the most prominent examples of gen AI usage within red 
team assessments is assisting with the process of generating 
content and media. Mandiant Red Team assessments will 
often include a social engineering portion, during which 
Mandiant is tasked with convincing clients to undertake 
malicious actions unknowingly. This is commonly done through 
text\- or image\-based channels, such as impersonation emails 
or websites. Mandiant consultants have used gen AI tooling 
to create initial drafts of malicious emails, as well as potential 
landing pages under the guise of communications that are 
more routine. When successful, these social engineering 
attempts result in Mandiant gaining access to a client network, 
which is often the first objective of the assessment.

However, success is not the only metric that is helpful when 
performing social engineering campaigns during red team 
assessments. By offloading the setup workflow to an AI 
system, Mandiant is able to gain overall increases in 
throughput. The faster a social engineering campaign can be 
 set up and performed, the more potential campaigns can be 
completed. Instead of creating a template from scratch, 
for which tailoring details can be quite time consuming, gen 
AI can be leveraged to source social engineering pretexts 
more quickly.

Much like how gen AI can be leveraged for the creation 
of social engineering pretexts, gen AI has also proven to 
be helpful in software development across many areas of 
programming. Mandiant has found similar advances provided 
when AI is used to assist in the development of custom 
tooling during red team engagements. Gen AI is proving 
to be a capable resource when assisting with well\-known 
algorithms and data structures, can generate code from a 
natural language\-based description, and even integrates 
into popular developer environments. These capabilities 
and integrations provide significant value when Mandiant 
encounters uncommon or new applications and systems— 
a regular occurance during red team assessments.

In cases where environments do not fit the operational norm, 
Mandiant looks to operationalize as much tooling as possible 
to assist with achieving a variety of engagement objectives. 
In one scenario, Mandiant consultants used gen AI to help 
build a set of tools that would assist with the enumeration of 
accessible cloud environments to provide recommendations 
that improve the security posture of customer environments. 
Without gen AI, this process would have been much lengthier, 

Special Report: Mandiant M\-Trends 202482

forcing consultants to spend hours scouring related 
documentation as opposed to operating and delivering value. 
Tooling built during engagements often live on well past the 
close of the engagement, continuing to provide value well 
into the future when reused. By closing the time necessary for 
the initial research and creation, the value gained by repeated 
use increases as the tooling is formalized and adopted in 
future engagements.

Rapid Knowledge Acquisition

During purple team engagements, Mandiant looks to become 
familiar with a client’s environment from the perspective 
of both attacker and defender. Logging, data storage, and 
detection stacks come in a variety of packages from off\-
the\-shelf software to custom built detection stacks made of

bespoke software. 
This often places 
a consultant in an 
environment where 
they may not be fully 
knowledgeable of the 
defensive toolkit that 
the customer relies 
on for day\-to\-day 
operations. As a result, 
Mandiant consultants 
must familiarize 
themselves not only 
with the products in 

use, but their potential responses to the attacks being tested. 

Recently, Mandiant has begun to leverage gen AI in a 
conversation capacity to enhance understandings of 
platforms and subsequently hone in on the security aspects 
of those platforms. Conversations with gen AIs are often 
iterative, with broad\-stroke initial requests such as asking 
the AI to describe the common logging methods of a 
specific piece of software. This provides a launchpad for 
the conversation to turn to more detailed topics based on 
subsequent questions, which reference previous answers and 
public documentation. While this workflow requires vetting 
of answers and follow\-on testing, the collaborative nature 
of the process provides a user with a framework and initial 
knowledge base off which they can work. Ultimately this has 
led to an ability to build a more accurate understanding of the 
technology stack deployed within a customer’s environment, 
a better engagement workflow, and a better product.

Future adoption of AI for 
Red Teams

AI and large language model (LLM) development teams seek 
to ingrain a concept of appropriate values within a developed 
language model. This concept, called “AI Alignment”, attempts 
to produce models that work to advance the designer’s 
intended goals within the values defined, while denying 
requests which fall outside them. AI alignment helps provide 
guardrails, which limit the malicious use of an AI. While 
attackers have leveraged AI to become more efficient, shy 
of developing their own models, they have to operate within 
the bounds defined by the alignment or attempt to break 
the alignment. Google even operates their own AI\-specific 
Red Team35 to help find and address potential misuse of AI. 
However, Mandiant’s red team assessments present a logical 
conundrum for AI alignment. 

Mandiant’s red team performs sanctioned malicious actions 
that customers have requested in order to help improve the 
overall security of their environments. The concept of AI 
Alignment places a ceiling on the level of AI adoption red 
teams can expect when the values encoded in the AI make 
it such that it will not provide answers. Conversely, red team 
engagements produce high\-quality data, which helps drive 
better security outcomes for customers that can, in turn, be 
used to train AI models.

An exciting feature of LLMs is their ability to be fine\-tuned 
or trained on what is known as domain specific knowledge. 
The majority of LLMs used by the public are generalist LLMs, 
meaning that the models are trained on a variety of data 
that covers a wide swath of different knowledge domains 
varying in both depth and breadth. Some LLMs are tuned for 
programming, whereas others might be targeted towards 
medical knowledge such as MedLM.36 For the purposes of 
cybersecurity experts, there is Google’s SecLM,37 which is 
designed to provide actionable visibility into the latest threats. 
Tuning LLMs on specific knowledge domains requires vast 
amounts of specialized data within the target domain. Red 
teams, as professional organizations, generate and store 
a substantial amount of data, which could be used to train 
models tuned to help secure customer environments. 

Resolving these logical and technical challenges will require 
a multi\-pronged approach. Red teams will need to generate 
structured data on which models can be trained, and provide 
subject matter expertise to AI developers. Meanwhile, AI 
developers will have to find novel ways to pursue AI Alignment 
that leverages the legitimate use of malicious activity, and 
to properly secure access to the models that will be trained 
on that data. The combination of red team expertise and 
powerful AI leads could result in a future where red teams are 
considerably more effective, and organizations are better able 
to stay ahead of the risk posed by motivated attackers.

SPECIAL REPORT: MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 2023EMBARGO84

The continued decrease in global median dwell 
time is a positive trend to see, and a testament 
to the efforts of defenders to detect threats 
as quickly as possible. However, attackers are 
not giving up. In fact, they are focusing more 
of their efforts on evasion—notably through 
the increased use of zero\-day vulnerabilities, 
and targeting of edge devices and other 
technologies outside the traditional lines of 
visibility. This is bound to be one of the more 
challenging trends facing defenders in 2024\. 

One of the ways organizations can test how 
quickly their security teams can defend 
against evasion tactics—as well as other 
threats discussed in M\-Trends 2024 such as 
phishing and MFA bypasses—is by leveraging 
red team exercises. M\-Trends 2024 highlights 
how Mandiant red and purple teams are using 
AI—as well as the latest attacker tactics, 
techniques and procedures—to enhance and 
improve the effectiveness of engagements, 
providing customers with a clear under\-
standing about the effectiveness of their 
security controls. AI is a powerful tool, and 
 organizations are increasingly using it 
in their security toolkit to identify threats 
faster, eliminate toil, and fill talent gaps. On 
the offensive end, attacker use of AI remains 
limited38 for now, and is most notably being 
used for social engineering and information 
operations.

Preparation is vital, and should be 
comprehensive and layered. In addition to 
conducting red team and other exercises 
to test security teams, other best practices 
include involving Communications, Legal 
and other relevant teams in regular tabletop 
exercises that test incident response plans, 
and continually reviewing those incident 
response plans throughout the year.

Sound fundamentals, such as vulnerability and 
exposure management, least privilege, and 
hardening also play a role in building strong 
defenses. Organizations should focus on 
building a comprehensive security program 
that spans the entire enterprise, from cloud 
and on\-premises, to IT/OT, and all assets. 
This program should be backed by strong 
detection and proactive hunting capabilities 
that are fueled by impactful threat intelligence.

The Mandiant mission is to help keep every 
organization secure from cyber threats and 
confident in their readiness. Our annual 
M\-Trends report, featuring data and learnings 
from our engagements, plays a big part in 
advancing that mission. We will continue to 
share our frontline knowledge in M\-Trends to 
improve our collective security awareness, 
understanding, and capabilities.
