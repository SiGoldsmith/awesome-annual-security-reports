Summary\_ 

Ransomware attacks have reached new heights of ambition and audacity 
over the past year, marked by a notable surge in extortion attacks. 
Adding to the increase in ransomware attacks, ThreatLabz research 
uncovered an unprecedented ransom payout of US$75 million—the 
largest ever paid by one company. This amount is nearly double the 
highest publicly known ransom payment.1 In 2023 alone, ransomware 
payments exceeded $1 billion, highlighting the escalating financial impact 
of these cybercrimes.

Ransomware threat actors’ tactics have become increasingly sophisticated 
and bold. Notably, they have surpassed the traditional boundaries of 
the corporations they attack, even going so far as to target the children 
of executives to provoke faster and higher ransoms.2 From critical 
infrastructure3 and major corporations4 to small and medium\-sized 
enterprises, no organization is immune to finding themselves in the 
crosshairs of the next campaign or evolution of attacks.

Despite law enforcement takedowns of multiple initial access brokers 
under special ops “Operation Endgame” and “Operation Duck 
Hunt,” many of the largest active ransomware families continue to 
rapidly regroup and launch new attacks while barely skipping a beat. 
Unfortunately, many ransomware actors are beyond the reach of law 
enforcement, making them virtually immune to criminal prosecution. 
As detailed in this report, law enforcement agencies have augmented 
their pressure tactics through reward money, sanctions, trolling, and 
exposing the individuals behind ransomware using various forms of 
psychological tactics.

As ransomware actors continuously evolve their tactics, it is crucial to stay 
up to date on how the threat landscape is changing.

The Zscaler ThreatLabz 2024 Ransomware Report offers an overview of 
the ransomware threat landscape from April 2023 through April 2024, 
detailing the latest trends, targets, ransomware families, and effective 
defense strategies.

ThreatLabz found that ransomware attacks increased by 17\.8% year\-over\-
year based on blocked attempts in the Zscaler cloud, while ransomware 
attacks identified through data leak site analysis surged by 57\.8%. The 
most common targets were businesses in the manufacturing, healthcare, 
and technology sectors, putting critical operations and infrastructure 
squarely in the line of attack.

The findings presented in this report underscore the need for organizations 
to prioritize protection against the relentless tide of ransomware. The 
insights and strategies in the report serve as a crucial guide for improving 
your ransomware defenses. By understanding the latest trends and 
vulnerabilities, and implementing recommended best practices, you can 
significantly reduce the risk of becoming a ransomware victim and better 
protect your organization’s critical assets and data.

Findings

Zscaler ThreatLabz research 
uncovered a record\-breaking 
ransom payment of US$75 million
—the largest ransomware payment by a 
company in history—nearly double the highest 
publicly known payout.

Ransomware attacks blocked by 
the Zscaler cloud increased by 
17\.8%, and the number of extorted 
companies on data leak sites 
grew by 57\.8% in the same period 
year\-over\-year despite numerous law 
enforcement operations, including the seizure 
of infrastructure along with arrests, criminal 
indictments, and sanctions.

The manufacturing, healthcare, 
and technology sectors were the 
top targets of ransomware attacks,
while the energy sector experienced a 500% 
year\-over\-year spike as critical infrastructure 
and susceptibility to operational disruptions 
make it particularly attractive to cybercriminals.

The United States remains the top 
target of ransomware, experiencing 
49\.95% of overall attacks,
followed by the United Kingdom, Germany, 
Canada, and France.

ThreatLabz identified 19 new 
ransomware families during the analysis 
period, bringing the total number to 391 since 
our tracking started.

The most active ransomware 
families were LockBit (22\.1%), BlackCat 
(a.k.a. ALPHV) (9\.2%), and 8Base (7\.9%).

Vulnerabilities remain an all\-too\-
common ransomware attack vector,
emphasizing the importance of timely patching 
and unified vulnerability management, 
underpinned by a zero trust architecture to 
provide protection even when patches are 
not available.

Voice\-based social engineering 
attacks are increasingly being used
to gain access to corporate networks—a 
technique used by Scattered Spider and the 
Qakbot threat group.

ransomware attacks

The latest ThreatLabz analysis reveals a concerning trend, with a 17\.84% 
year\-over\-year increase in ransomware attacks based on blocked 
attempts observed across the Zscaler cloud. The rise in ransomware 
activity translates to significant disruptions and financial impacts to victim 
organizations of all sizes. These attacks often disrupt business operations, 
causing extended downtime, substantial data loss, and high recovery 
costs. The financial burden is considerable; not only is there a ransom 
demand at play, but system restoration and damage control can come 
at a hefty price. In light of these escalating threats, the need for robust 
ransomware defense measures has never been greater.

impacted by ransomware 

Ransomware attacks pose significant risks to businesses of all sizes and 
industries. These attacks can compromise sensitive data, lead to heavy 
financial losses, disrupt business continuity, and damage reputations. 
Different industries face unique ransomware challenges based on how they 
operate, the data they handle, and their technological infrastructure.

Despite the variables, ransomware extortion attacks have consistently 
surged, with the number of victim companies listed on data leak sites 
increasing by 57\.81% since last year’s ThreatLabz report on ransomware 
trends. The manufacturing industry was by far the most targeted industry, 
accounting for 653 attacks—more than two times as many as any 
other industry.

ThreatLabz 2024 Ransomware Report©2024 Zscaler, Inc. All rights reserved.Year\-over\-year trends
The energy sector experienced a 527\.27% year\-over\-year increase in 
ransomware attacks, likely due to its critical nature and the high ransom 
potential it offers to attackers.

Similarly, the restaurants, bars, and food services industry saw a 
333\.33% rise in such attacks. This may be attributed to the sector’s rapid 
digitization, driven by the adoption of advanced point\-of\-sales systems 
and online ordering platforms. While these technologies may streamline 
operations and improve customer experiences, they can also introduce 
potential vulnerabilities.

While this rise highlights the prevalence of ransomware attacks, it may 
not capture the full extent of ransomware incidents. Many attacks go 
unreported or are resolved privately through ransom payments without 
public disclosure. Thus, these figures should be seen as indicative of 
broader ransomware trends rather than a comprehensive representation of 
the entire threat landscape.

©2024 Zscaler, Inc. All rights reserved.ThreatLabz 2024 Ransomware ReportUnderstanding the distribution of ransomware attacks is essential for risk assessment, resource allocation, policy 
development, international cooperation, and public awareness efforts in combating ransomware threats.

Risk assessment
Analyzing heavily targeted regions helps organizations in 
those areas to assess their own risk levels and implement 
stronger cybersecurity. In ThreatLabz research, the US 
accounts for 50% of global ransomware attacks, calling 
for organizations within its borders to prioritize stringent 
security protocols.

Policy development
Governments can use insights from regional ransomware 
attacks to inform legislation, improve security standards, 
promote international cooperation, and facilitate public\-
private sector information sharing. As a recent notable 
example, the SEC’s new cybersecurity rules mark a major 
step in enhancing transparency and accountability amid 
growing threats. 

Public awareness
Highlighting frequently targeted countries may urge 
individuals, organizations, and governments to take more 
proactive measures when it comes to cybersecurity 
training, incident response planning, and investment in 
defensive technologies.

Resource allocation
Targeted data enables governments and organizations to 
strategically allocate resources, enhancing their security 
posture by prioritizing support, funding, and expertise in 
areas with the highest threat levels.

International cooperation
Identifying the most targeted countries allows 
coordinated efforts between law enforcement, 
organizations, and governments to combat 
ransomware at the national and international levels.
Operation Duck Hunt and Operation Endgame 
exemplify how international cooperation can disrupt 
cybercriminal activities.

©2024 Zscaler, Inc. All rights reserved.ThreatLabz 2024 Ransomware ReportYear\-over\-year trends
ThreatLabz compared ransomware attacks from this year's report with the ThreatLabz 2023 Ransomware Report to assess rates of 
change. Among the top 15 most targeted countries, the US experienced a notable year\-over\-year increase of 101\.88%, and Sweden saw 
a staggering 350% rise, although it accounted for a significantly smaller share of the total attacks.

While analyzing ransomware trends at a global level is invaluable, it is also important to examine the specific developments in different 
regions of the world. Studying regional breakdowns helps organizations create tailored security plans and aid governments in developing 
more effective cybersecurity policies.

ThreatLabz 2024 Ransomware Report©2024 Zscaler, Inc. All rights reserved.Major vulnerabilities used in 
ransomware attacks

Vulnerabilities in software, systems, and the overall digital infrastructure can serve as critical entry 
points for ransomware attacks. Organizations must be aware of these vulnerabilities and take 
proactive measures to address them.

The Cybersecurity \& Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) maintains a comprehensive list of 
vulnerabilities,5 including those actively exploited by ransomware groups. It is highly recommended 
that organizations closely monitor this list and prioritize the mitigation of vulnerabilities mentioned 
therein. Proactive vulnerability management is essential for strengthening the overall cybersecurity 
posture of an organization.

In many cases, the vulnerabilities exploited by ransomware groups impact internet\-connected assets 
in organizations’ external attack surface, such as gateways, VPNs, and other remote connectivity 
technologies. Because they are internet\-facing, these vulnerabilities are significantly easier for threat 
actors to scan for and exploit. CISA’s latest guidance6 further emphasizes vulnerabilities in VPNs and 
remote connectivity solutions as critical points of concern, advising the adoption of the most current 
approaches, such as zero trust architecture, SSE, and SASE, which are based on granular access 
control policies.

Over the past year, prominent ransomware families have targeted and exploited the vulnerabilities 
shown in figure 10, significantly impacting a wide range of systems.

Ransomware\_Roundup: 

What’s Making Headlines

Ransomware is pervasive and transcends industries—and when one group is shut down, another is reborn 
or emerges anew. Here are some recent stories highlighting the ever\-evolving ransomware landscape.

The ransomware plague 
in healthcare 

The healthcare industry faced significant challenges throughout 2023 
and into 2024 as it was heavily targeted by ransomware groups. The 
repercussions of disrupting healthcare operations are serious: ambulances 
get rerouted, prescriptions are delayed, and essential medical procedures 
have to be postponed. Moreover, the theft of sensitive health data can 
have far\-reaching consequences, including identity theft and healthcare 
fraud, further exacerbating vulnerabilities in the healthcare ecosystem.

This is a stark reminder that the old adage “there is no honor among 
thieves” holds true for ransomware attacks. Even if ransoms are paid, there 
is no guarantee that the threat group will not still post or delete stolen 
data. In addition, some ransomware decryption tools contain bugs that 
prevent successful data recovery, and may take longer to recover data than 
from a backup.

U N F O R E S E E N C O N S E QU E N C E S O F R A N S O M PAY M E N T S
A healthcare technology provider for payment solutions fell victim to a 
ransomware attack orchestrated by the BlackCat group. Despite complying 
with the attackers’ demands and paying a staggering $22 million ransom, 
the ordeal took an unexpected turn. BlackCat reneged on their promise 
to share a portion of the ransom with the affiliate behind the attack (a 
so\-called “exit scam”), prompting the affiliate to threaten the healthcare 
provider with the release of sensitive data.

D O U B L E E X TO R T I O N, D O U B L E V I C T I M I Z AT I O N
In February 2023, a prominent US pharmaceutical distributor confirmed 
that their IT systems had been compromised. The breach affected one of 
the distributor’s subsidiaries, with the stolen files later leaked by the Lorenz 
ransomware group.7 Then, in February 2024, the same distributor faced 
another ransomware attack.8 This appears to be part of a growing trend 
ThreatLabz has observed, where a company has been subject to multiple 
ransomware incidents within one year.

©2024 Zscaler, Inc. All rights reserved.ThreatLabz 2024 Ransomware ReportThe impact of the SEC’s 
cybersecurity ruling

In 2023, the SEC introduced new cybersecurity disclosure rules to enhance 
transparency and accountability among publicly traded companies. Effective 
December 15, 2023, these rules mandate the timely reporting of material 
cybersecurity incidents and require detailed information about a company’s 
cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance. Key components of 
the SEC rulings include the addition of Item 1\.05 to for 8\-K, which necessitates 
reporting of material cybersecurity incidents within four business days of the 
company’s determination of materiality. Additionally, Form 10\-K now requires 
annual reporting on cybersecurity risk management and strategy, starting with 
fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2023\. Foreign private issuers must 
also comply with comparable disclosures on Form 6\-K and Form 20\-K. 

The rulings present a new challenge for ransomware actors offering 
publicly traded companies private payment resolution services, as the 
companies are now still required to fully disclose the attack. On the 
positive side, the new mandate undercuts encryptionless extortion attacks, 
an emerging trend by which ransomware actors rely solely on the threat of 
leaking stolen data to demand ransoms.

H OW T H E N EW R U L E S I M PAC T C O M PA N I E S
The SEC’s cybersecurity rulings can pose serious challenges for companies 
in terms of compliance and risk management. While intended to enhance 
transparency and investor protection, these rules require companies to 
navigate complex reporting requirements and provide prompt disclosure of 
material incidents.

One major impact is the increased pressure on companies to quantify and 
assess cyber incidents accurately. Determining materiality and the potential 
impact of cyber incidents requires careful analysis, which can be costly and 
may require companies (big and small) to rethink their incident response 
protocols and update their disclosures to meet the SEC’s requirements. 

Moreover, compliance timelines vary based on the size and reporting 
status of companies, adding another layer of complexity. Smaller reporting 
companies often have different, and typically longer, compliance deadlines 
compared to larger corporations. And while larger corporations must 
adhere to tighter deadlines, their scale also affords them more resources to 
analyze the materiality of a cybersecurity incident.

The new disclosure requirements also eliminate the possibility for public 
companies to pay ransoms quietly without incurring reputational damage 
and the backlash that follows after openly sharing information about 
a breach.

Despite the SEC’s clear guidelines, some companies have already fallen 
short of compliance with the new cybersecurity rules. Recent disclosures 
from well\-known companies have raised concerns about noncompliance 
and the adequacy of their incident reporting.9 Many of these disclosures 
lack quantitative data and detailed assessments of the financial and 
operational implications of the cyber incidents, which is precisely what the 
SEC now mandates. This trend, where companies provide deficient cyber 
incident disclosures despite the SEC ruling, may call for enhanced guidance 
and regulatory oversight to ensure consistent and effective compliance. 

The SEC’s cybersecurity rulings represent a significant regulatory 
shift aimed at improving transparency and accountability in incident 
reporting. Adhering to these new rules consistently and in good faith 
will require ongoing collaboration between regulators, companies, and 
industry stakeholders.

Qakbot disrupted by “Operation Duck Hunt”
On August 29, 2023, in a coordinated multinational effort, the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced 
Operation Duck Hunt. Zscaler ThreatLabz provided significant technical 
assistance to law enforcement for this operation.10 Qakbot’s infrastructure 
was designed to be resilient against takedown attempts through a multi\-
tiered infrastructure, as shown in figure 11\.

This infrastructure provided several layers of resiliency, with each tier 

requiring a coordinated effort to dismantle. The first tier of Qakbot’s 
infrastructure included infected systems running a supernode plugin that 
relayed traffic upstream to several proxies designed to hide the master 
Qakbot backend server.

Operation Duck Hunt redirected the supernode’s upstream proxy servers to 
a set of sinkhole servers to immediately take over Qakbot’s infrastructure 
as shown in figure 12\.

11 TechCrunch, How the FBI took down the notorious Qakbot botnet, September 1, 2023\.

Once the FBI hijacked the supernodes, the 
sinkhole servers instructed victim computers to 
download shellcode that reflectively loaded a DLL 
that neutralized the malware. This successfully 
disinfected the victim computers and prevented 
further attacks. 

At the time of the takedown, Qakbot had infected 
more than 700,000 computers worldwide, 
including more than 200,000 in the United 
States alone.11 Prior to this operation, Qakbot was 
active for nearly 15 years, originally designed to 
facilitate credit card and wire fraud. In 2019, the 
group pivoted to serving as an initial access broker 
for ransomware groups including Conti, ProLock, 
Egregor, REvil, MegaCortex, and Black Basta.

Qakbot malware was typically distributed 
through spam emails containing malicious 
attachments or links. Once infected, Cobalt Strike 
was frequently deployed for lateral movement 
and the eventual deployment of ransomware.

Unfortunately, there were no arrests or unsealed 
indictments against any of the threat actors, 
and Qakbot resurfaced in December 2023\. The 
group updated the malware to support 64\-
bit versions of Windows, changed the internal 
configuration format, and modified the network 
communication to use AES encryption. As we 
will discuss later in the report, the Qakbot threat 
actor has significantly changed their TTPs since 
Operation Duck Hunt.

targeted multiple initial access brokers

On May 28, 2024, in collaboration with numerous international law enforce\-
ment agencies, Europol announced Operation Endgame, which simultane\-
ously targeted multiple initial access brokers. This led to more than a dozen 
global searches, several arrests, and the shutdown of more than 100 serv\-
ers used for criminal activity. These servers were integral to the operations of 
various malware downloaders (a.k.a. “loaders”) that had been used to infiltrate 
victims’ computers, deploying malicious software including ransomware.

The malware families targeted in this operation were responsible for in\-
fecting millions of computers around the globe, including in healthcare fa\-
cilities and critical infrastructure services. As part of the operation, action 
was taken against SmokeLoader, Pikabot, Bumblebee, and IcedID.

Zscaler ThreatLabz provided critical technical assistance for Operation 
Endgame’s SmokeLoader sinkhole and remediation efforts.

SmokeLoader, active since 2011, was used by several initial access 
brokers for ransomware, including Raspberry Robin and the Stop (a.k.a. 
DJVU) ransomware gang. Operation Endgame seized more than 1,000 
SmokeLoader domains used by these threat groups. The domains were 
then redirected to a sinkhole server controlled by law enforcement. The 
map in figure 13 depicts infected systems that communicated with the 
SmokeLoader sinkhole.

This map demonstrates the far\-reaching impact 
that SmokeLoader had around the world, with 
significant infections in Latin America, Asia, 
North America, and Europe.

Figure 14: SmokeLoader systems cleaned by Operation Endgame.

Pikabot originally emerged in early 2023 and exhibited significant activity 
in the latter half of the year. This increase was due to the malware 
becoming the initial access broker of choice for Black Basta ransomware 
after Operation Duck Hunt disrupted Qakbot. In February 2024, Pikabot 
reemerged with significant changes in its code base and structure. 
Pikabot was observed by ThreatLabz regularly deploying Cobalt Strike and 
Metasploit’s Meterpreter.

Bumblebee was introduced in March 2022 and had ties to the former 
Conti ransomware group. The malware was the successor to the group’s 
BazarLoader malware tool, which they used for initial access for Conti 
and Diavol ransomware attacks. ThreatLabz frequently observed both 
BazarLoader and Bumblebee deploying Cobalt Strike payloads for lateral 
movement. Bumblebee has also been associated with Akira and Black 
Basta ransomware attacks.

Similar to Qakbot, IcedID was originally designed as a banking trojan when 
it appeared in 2017\. However, the group later shifted their focus to serving 
as an initial access broker for ransomware. Over the years, the malware 
code for IcedID has been forked and modified for various purposes. In 
addition, the same developers created a new malware loader known as 
Latrodectus, released in November 2023, which was also likely used to 
deploy ransomware.

Following Operation Endgame, there has been minimal activity for most 
of these initial access brokers with the exception of Latrodectus, which 
resurfaced in less than a month. However, the lull is likely to be short\-lived 
as the threat actors regroup.

©2024 Zscaler, Inc. All rights reserved.ThreatLabz 2024 Ransomware ReportHive ransomware reborn as Hunters 
International 

In January 2023, the Hive ransomware group’s 
infrastructure was shut down. After a seven\-
month covert operation, the FBI successfully 
infiltrated Hive’s servers, recovering more 
than 300 decryption keys that prevented 
approximately $130 million in ransom 
payments. Operating since June 2021, the 
Hive collective targeted and victimized more 
than 1,500 organizations worldwide, amassing 
over $100 million in ransom payments.12 
Victims included hospitals, school districts, 
financial institutions, and various other entities. 
However, no arrests associated with Hive were 
made, and the group rebranded as Hunters 
International in October 2023\. Cybercriminals 
often use this rebranding strategy after a 
major disruption.

The group made one noticeable change to their 
operation: they will no longer offer discounts or 
negotiate with victims from the initial ransom 
demand, as shown in figure 15\.

12 US Department of Justice, U.S. Department of Justice Disrupts Hive 

Ransomware Variant, January 26, 2023\.

Figure 15: Hunters International victim portal with no price discounts or negotiations.

The non\-negotiable price policy is very 
uncommon with ransomware groups, which 
frequently offer significant discounts from 
the original ransom demand. This decision 
by the Hunters team will likely lead to lower 
overall payment volume, but higher overall 
payment amounts.

Hunters International continues to launch 
new attacks and is likely to remain a 
formidable threat without further arrests and 
criminal indictments.

Top 5 Ransomware\_Families 

to Watch in 
2024\-2025

As ransomware and other cyberthreats continue to evolve in complexity 
and sophistication, staying informed about the most prevalent and 
dangerous ransomware families is crucial for maintaining an effective 
security posture. This section highlights five ransomware families that pose 
some of the most significant risks to businesses, providing insights into 
their tactics, potential impact, and recent activity. 

and penetration testing teams. Once Dark Angels have identified and 
compromised a target, they selectively decide whether to encrypt the 
company’s files. In most cases, the Dark Angels group steals a vast amount 
of information, typically in the range of 1\-10 TB. For large businesses, the 
group has exfiltrated between 10\-100 TB of data, which can take days to 
weeks to transfer.

\#1 Dark Angels

The Dark Angels ransomware group, which operates the Dunghill data 
leak site, emerged around May 2022\. The group has conducted some 
of the largest ransomware attacks, yet has managed to attract very 
minimal attention. In early 2024, ThreatLabz uncovered a victim who 
paid Dark Angels $75 million, higher than any publicly known amount—
an achievement that’s bound to attract the interest of other attackers 
looking to replicate such success by adopting their key tactics (which 
we describe below). Dark Angels targets various industries, including 
healthcare, government, finance, and education. More recently, they have 
been observed launching attacks against large industrial, technology, and 
telecommunication companies.

The Dark Angels group employs a highly targeted approach, typically 
attacking a single large company at a time. This is in stark contrast to 
most ransomware groups, which target victims indiscriminately and 
outsource most of the attack to affiliate networks of initial access brokers 

The highest\-profile attack conducted by Dark Angels was in September 
2023, when the group breached an international conglomerate that 
provides solutions for building automation systems among other services. 
Dark Angels demanded a $51 million ransom, claimed to have stolen 
over 27 TB of corporate data, and encrypted the company’s VMware 
ESXi virtual machines. A RagnarLocker ransomware variant was used to 
encrypt the company’s files during the attack. The relationship between 
RagnarLocker and Dark Angels is not clear, but the group was using the 
ransomware prior to the law enforcement action against RagnarLocker,13 
which resulted in the arrest of a key member in October 2023\. Note that 
when Dark Angels first appeared, they deployed a Babuk variant before 
switching to RagnarLocker.

The Dark Angels ransomware group’s strategy of targeting a small number 
of high\-value companies for large payouts is a trend worth monitoring. 
Zscaler ThreatLabz predicts that other ransomware groups will take note 
of Dark Angels’ success and may adopt similar tactics, focusing on high\-
value targets and increasing the significance of data theft to maximize their 
financial gains.

ThreatLabz 2024 Ransomware Report©2024 Zscaler, Inc. All rights reserved.\#2 LockBit

LockBit first emerged in September 2019 and quickly rose to prominence 
due to the group’s large ransomware affiliate network. LockBit leverages 
affiliates to conduct breaches, exfiltrate data, and deploy its ransomware. 
Infiltration typically starts through spam emails containing malicious 
attachments or links. Other methods include executing brute\-force 
password attacks that target Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or VPN 
credentials, purchasing compromised stolen credentials through initial 
access brokers, and exploiting public\-facing applications. LockBit’s 
cybercriminal network has targeted critical sectors such as manufacturing, 
healthcare, and logistics. The group has collectively targeted more 
than 2,000 systems worldwide and extorted more than $120 million 
from victims.

Over the last year, LockBit has remained at the top of the pack in terms 
of attack volume. Using a markedly different strategy from Dark Angels, 
the LockBit group encourages affiliates to attack as many organizations 
as possible, regardless of the potential reward. This high volume of 
attacks often results in small businesses being targeted with relatively low 
ransom demands.

LockBit ransomware is deployed on Windows and Linux\-based systems. 
There are three versions of LockBit for Windows: LockBit Red (the 
original), LockBit Black (based on BlackMatter source code), and LockBit 
Green (based on the leaked Conti source code). As mentioned in the 
ThreatLabz 2023 Ransomware Report, the LockBit Black builder was 
leaked, and many cybercriminal groups not affiliated with LockBit have 
used it for their own ransomware attacks. Interestingly, LockBit Black is 
still the group’s most commonly deployed variant. The specific LockBit 
ransomware variant used to encrypt a victim’s files is now shown in the 
ransom note next to the victim ID. This enables the threat actor conducting 
the attack to easily identify the LockBit variant deployed to aid them in 
providing the proper decryption tool when a ransom is paid. See figure 16 
for an example of a recent LockBit Black ransom note.

ThreatLabz 2024 Ransomware Report

On February 20, 2024, the FBI and UK 
law enforcement seized parts of LockBit’s 
infrastructure, which included approximately 
7,000 victim decryption keys. After the 
seizure, law enforcement commandeered 
the LockBit data leak website and mocked 
the cybercriminals with a similar rendition of 
the former site displaying various articles and 
countdown timers until new information was 
released, as shown in figure 17 below.

Unfortunately, within days of the takedown, 
ThreatLabz identified new ransomware 
attacks perpetrated by LockBit and a new data 
leak site. The group has remained active and 
attacked dozens of new entities since the law 
enforcement action.

On May 7, 2024, the FBI announced the 
indictment of LockBit developer and operator 
Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev. However, the 
LockBit operator quickly denied that the FBI 
correctly identified him. Without further 
arrests, LockBit attacks will likely continue for 
the foreseeable future, although at some point 
ThreatLabz expects the LockBit brand may be 
retired and the operation resurrected under 
another name due to increased scrutiny.

BlackCat (a.k.a. ALPHV) ransomware, 
introduced in November 2021, was one 
of the most notorious threats until it was 
shuttered in March 2024\. Similar to LockBit, 
BlackCat leveraged an affiliate network to 
launch attacks and shared a percentage of the 
ransom payments.

Arguably the most infamous BlackCat affiliate 
is a group known as Scattered Spider14 (a.k.a. 
Star Fraud). Made up of English\-speaking 
members, this group is highly effective in social 
engineering attacks, often impersonating IT or 
help desk staff in voice calls and carrying out 
SIM swapping attacks to defeat multifactor 
authentication. On June 15, 2024, the alleged 
ringleader15 of Scattered Spider, a 22\-year\-old 
UK national, was arrested. However, it is too 
soon to tell what impact this arrest will have on 
the group’s ability to continue its attacks.

BlackCat was one of the most cross\-platform 
compatible ransomware families, partly because 
it uses the Rust programming language. Figure 
18 shows the decryption tools available for all 
platforms that were supported by BlackCat 
ransomware just before the group shut down 
operations. The platforms included Windows, 
ESXi, FreeBSD, and numerous variants of Linux 
operating systems and architectures, such as 
ARM, x86/x64, and PowerPC.

14 Cybersecurity \& Infrastructure Security Agency, Cybersecurity Advisory: 

Scattered Spider, November 16, 2023\.

15 Krebs on Security, Alleged Boss of ‘Scattered Spider’ Hacking Group Arrested, 

June 15, 2024\.

This level of cross\-platform compilation is unusual in comparison to other 
ransomware families that typically only support Windows, ESXi, and a 
small number of Linux\-based platforms. This indicates that BlackCat 
affiliates may have requested support for additional platforms in order to 
encrypt files on as many systems as possible.

In December 2023, the FBI gained access to some of BlackCat’s 
infrastructure. The FBI attempted to seize the group’s Tor\-based websites, 
including the ransom negotiation portals and data leak sites. However, in a 
swift turn of events, BlackCat posted a message that they had “unseized” 
the data leak website and provided a link to a new data leak website that 
the FBI could not manipulate, as shown in figure 19 below.

This back and forth between the FBI and BlackCat occurred over a few days 
until BlackCat was confident that the new data leak site was sufficiently 
advertised. Note that “seizing” a Tor\-based website is not as trivial as a 
traditional DNS\-based website because it relies on cryptographic secrets 
rather than a central authority that is subject to court orders.

In March 2024, the BlackCat group announced their disbandment, citing the 
compromise of their infrastructure by the FBI, which supposedly rendered 
them unable to continue their operations. However, suspicions arose due 
to the timing of their shutdown occurring immediately after receiving a $22 
million ransom and then performing an exit scam on an affiliate who assisted 
them in breaching a healthcare provider (discussed earlier in this report).

While BlackCat ransomware is no longer active, the affiliates behind the 
group’s attacks have likely migrated to other ransomware\-as\-a\-service 
networks such as RansomHub (where the data stolen from the healthcare 
provider who paid the $22 million ransom has since been leaked). 
Furthermore, the BlackCat ransomware group itself is unlikely to have truly 
ceased their operations and will likely reemerge under a new brand name.

different operating systems, architectures, and platforms.

Akira ransomware burst onto the scene in April 
2023, quickly gaining infamy for the volume 
of attacks conducted by affiliates. The Akira 
threat group is likely another offshoot from the 
defunct Conti group. In fact, Akira’s ransomware 
code originally shared many similarities with the 
leaked Conti source code. However, the group 
has more recently developed a Rust\-based 
ransomware that contains references to Power 
Rangers characters such as Megazord.

Affiliates of Akira ransomware have employed 
various initial access mechanisms, including 
through the exploitation of CVE\-2023\-20269\.16 
The threat group operating Bumblebee, which 
has ties to Conti ransomware, has also been 
known to be an initial access broker for Akira. 
As mentioned earlier in the report, Operation 
Endgame dismantled Bumblebee but had a 
minimal impact on Akira’s operations.

To better understand Akira’s attacks, we 
can learn directly from the information that 
Akira provides to victims that pay a ransom. 
ThreatLabz captured the following chat 
message from Akira, which contains details 
about how they initially gained access to the 
company’s network through an initial access 
broker, and also offered tips for preventing 
ransomware attacks in the future:

16 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE\-2023\-20269

Initial access to your network was purchased on the dark web. Then 

kerberoasting was carried out and we got passwords hashes. Then we 

just bruted these and got domain admin password. Spending weeks 

inside of your network we’ve managed to detect some fails we highly 

recommend to eliminate: 

1\. None of your employees should open suspicious emails, suspicious 

links or download any files, much less run them on their computer.

2\. Use strong passwords, change them as often as possible (1\-2 times 

per month at least). Passwords should not match or be repeated on 

different resources.

3\. Install 2FA wherever possible.

4\. Use the latest versions of operating systems, as they are less 

vulnerable to attacks.

5\. Update all software versions.

6\. Use antivirus solutions and traffic monitoring tools.

7\. Create a jump host for your VPN. Use unique credentials on it 

that differ from domain one.

8\. Use backup software with cloud storage which supports a 

token key.

9\. Instruct your employees as often as possible about online safety 

precautions. The most vulnerable point is the human factor and the 

irresponsibility of your employees, system administrators, etc. We 

wish you safety, calmness and lots of benefits in the future. Thank 

you for working with us and your careful attitude to your security.

Although this advice comes directly from Akira, 
the recommendations are valid and provide a 
foundation for understanding and thwarting 
such attacks.

Akira is one of the only major ransomware 
groups that has not directly been subject to a 
law enforcement disruption. As a result, Akira is 
now one of the most active ransomware groups 
that will likely continue to launch new attacks 
over the next year.

23

ThreatLabz 2024 Ransomware Report©2024 Zscaler, Inc. All rights reserved.\#5 Black Basta
Black Basta ransomware, first identified in 
April 2022, is another successor to the Conti 
ransomware group. Black Basta affiliates have 
employed diverse methods to gain access to 
corporate networks. Prior to Operation Duck 
Hunt (August 2023\), Qakbot was a major initial 
access broker for Black Basta. As mentioned 
earlier, Pikabot stepped in to fill the void after 
the takedown. However, Pikabot was shuttered 
following Operation Endgame in May 2024\.

ThreatLabz has since been tracking new activity 
from the Qakbot threat group, which has pivoted 
and changed its TTPs significantly. Instead of 
using spam email to infect systems with Qakbot, 
the threat group is currently using a combination 
of social engineering techniques. Instead of 
sending spam emails to millions of addresses, 
the threat group is performing targeted attacks. 
These attacks start with the threat group sending 
spam emails to a small number of targeted 
companies. The group then calls an employee 
at these companies pretending to be from their 
own IT department. The caller instructs the victim 
to join a screen sharing session using remote 
desktop software such as Microsoft’s Quick Assist 
to “update the company’s spam filters” for the 
employee. Once the employee gives access to the 
threat actor, a Windows batch script is executed 
to perform reconnaissance, steal credentials, and 
install a backdoor on the victim’s system. The 
backdoor continues to change but has included 
Qakbot, Cobalt Strike, and a SOCKS proxy tool. 
The batch script contains a command line interface 
that appears similar to that shown in figure 20\.

Figure 20: Malicious Windows batch script interface used to establish a backdoor 
on a victim’s system as a precursor to a Black Basta ransomware attack.

Once this backdoor access has been 
established, the Qakbot threat group hands off 
access to a penetration testing team responsible 
for lateral movement and the ultimate 
deployment of Black Basta ransomware.

These attacks 
start with the 
threat group 
sending spam 
emails to a 
small number 
of targeted 
companies.

The group then 
calls an 
employee at 
these 
companies 
pretending to 
be from their 
own IT 
department.

The caller 
instructs the 
victim to join 
a screen 
sharing 
session to 
"update the 
company's spam 
filters" for 
the employee.

The backdoor 
continues to 
change but has 
included Qakbot, 
Cobalt Strike, 
and a SOCKS 
proxy tool.

Once the 
employee 
provides access 
to their system, 
the attacker 
executes a 
script to 
perform 
reconnaissance, 
steal 
credentials, and 
install a 
backdoor.

Figure 21: Black Basta ransomware attack chain with initial 
access brokered by Qakbot threat group. 

While Operation Duck Hunt had a significant 
short\-term impact, the threat group 
remains active and continues to innovate 
and experiment with new techniques to 
compromise organizations. Over the next year, 
the Qakbot threat group is likely to remain a 
major initial access broker for ransomware 
attacks such as Black Basta.

Ransomware\_Notes 
Archive

Zscaler ThreatLabz has been maintaining a public GitHub repository that, 
as of this writing, tracks 391 ransomware families and contains a total 
of 945 ransom notes, adding 19 families and 55 ransom notes between 
April 2023 and April 2024\. This archive can be valuable for tracking 
ransomware groups over time, including their data leak websites and 
negotiation tactics, and for linking ransomware groups that rebrand by 
using stylometric analysis.

Figure 22 shows a stylometric comparison between a Conti ransom chat 
(top) and a Black Basta ransom chat (bottom). This demonstrates that 
members of Black Basta are almost certainly former members of Conti as

even specific instructions.

Predictions

2\. Targeted attacks will increasingly 

adopt highly targeted attack 
strategies.

involve voice\-based social 
engineering.

Over the last year, Dark Angels has been one of the most successful 
and least known ransomware groups with a distinct strategy of 
targeting a small number of multibillion\-dollar businesses and 
extorting them for substantial ransoms. This strategy serves a dual 
purpose: reduce scrutiny from law enforcement and the security 
industry, while spending more resources to infiltrate large companies 
that are willing to pay significant ransoms to protect huge volumes 
of stolen data. This has led to the group receiving the largest known 
ransom payment of $75 million, which is bound to attract the interest 
of other ransomware threat actors in 2025 that may want to replicate 
their success.

In 2025, we expect to see an increase in targeted attacks facilitated 
by specialized initial access brokers. These brokers, exemplified by 
the activities of Qakbot and Scattered Spider, employ sophisticated 
techniques to secure entry, notably utilizing voice\-based (“vishing”) 
social engineering attacks to deceive individuals into granting 
access to a corporate environment, which is then used ultimately 
to exfiltrate data and deploy ransomware. This emerging trend 
highlights collaborations within the cybercriminal ecosystem and 
underscores the need for heightened vigilance and advanced security 
measures to counter these evolving threats.

GenAI to create more effective, personalized, 
and localized campaigns.

Increasing adoption of generative AI in 2025 and beyond will enable threat actors to craft spam 
emails with accurate grammar and spelling as well as use voice cloning to impersonate staff in 
order to gain privileged access. In the coming years, AI\-generated voices may be tailored with 
local accents and dialects to enhance credibility and increase the likelihood of success—and 
become a prime example of how ransomware threat actors will make attacks more convincing 
and difficult to detect.

4\. More cybersecurity incidents will be reported 

in line with new SEC rules.

With the SEC’s ruling mandating stricter cybersecurity incident reporting, 2025 will continue to 
witness an uptick in organizations disclosing ransomware incidents. This will hopefully result in 
increased transparency and promote a culture of accountability and proactive defenses, driving 
improvements in cybersecurity practices.

27

©2024 Zscaler, Inc. All rights reserved.ThreatLabz 2024 Ransomware Report5\. High\-volume data exfiltration ransomware 

attacks will be on the rise.

Attacks that exfiltrate large amounts of data, including more encryption\-less incidents, will 
increase significantly in the year ahead. This trend, which started gaining momentum in 2022, 
sees threat actors focusing solely on exfiltrating data without encrypting systems. The approach 
allows for quicker, opportunistic operations and capitalizes on the fear of sensitive data being 
released to coerce victims into paying ransoms. It underscores a continuous shift in ransomware 
strategies toward more efficient and high\-impact methods.

6\. Companies in the healthcare sector, especially, 
will continue to face persistent targeting by 
ransomware groups.

The high value of healthcare data will continue to attract attention in 2025\. Many healthcare 
companies lag in replacing legacy systems with modern, advanced security measures, making 
them particularly vulnerable. As a result, these organizations are likely to face repeated breaches 
and extortion attempts. Those that fail to take appropriate actions to prioritize zero trust 
defense strategies may find themselves targeted by ransomware groups.

7\. International collaboration against cybercrime 
organizations will build upon existing efforts.

Law enforcement and private industry will continue to collaborate in efforts to combat 
ransomware attacks, such as disrupting major initial access brokers and ransomware groups. 
International collaboration will become increasingly vital as global interconnectedness grows, 
making it easier for cybercriminals to operate transnationally. By sharing intelligence and 
expertise, these coordinated actions will more effectively disrupt global ransomware networks. 
Zscaler ThreatLabz has been at the forefront and instrumental in providing technical assistance 
for several of these operations over the last year.

Ransomware Protection

The rising complexity and cost of ransomware attacks underscores the 
need for comprehensive zero trust defenses. The Zscaler Zero Trust 
Exchange™ platform simplifies the challenge, offering a holistic approach 
to stopping ransomware.

The Zero Trust Exchange allows enterprises to deploy smarter defenses 
at every stage of an attack. This starts with preventing attackers from 
discovering or exploiting users and applications by making those users and 
apps invisible, accessible only by authorized users or devices. It inspects all 
inbound and outbound traffic inline, encrypted or not. Authenticated users 
and devices connect directly to the applications they need, never to the 
network—so even if an attacker gets in, they can’t move laterally to steal 
or encrypt data.

Legacy security architectures are 

ineffective at stopping ransomware attacks.

OU T WI TH TH E OL D : Traditional 
security measures and point solutions, 

including “next\-generation” firewalls 

and VPNs, often introduce blind spots, 

complexity, and significant costs. 

These legacy approaches fail to cost\-

effectively inspect encrypted files 

and traffic, leaving organizations 

vulnerable to lateral movement and 

ransomware attacks that exploit gaps 

in visibility and control—often with 

devastating consequences.

I N WITH ZE RO TRU ST: A zero trust 
architecture assumes every user, device, 

and connection is potentially compromised. 

This approach mandates continuous 

verification and strict access control. 

By consistently verifying identities 

and inspecting all traffic, including 

encrypted data, zero trust significantly 

reduces the risk of attacks spreading 

within the network, neutralizing 

ransomware threats before they can 

inflict damage.

reconnaissance and compromise to lateral 
movement, data theft, and payload execution. 

Minimize the attack surface: Built on a zero 
trust architecture, the Zero Trust Exchange 
replaces exploitable legacy VPN and firewall 
architectures that expand the attack surface. 
Zscaler effectively minimizes the attack 
surface by hiding users, applications, and 
devices behind a cloud proxy, where they are 
not visible or discoverable from the internet. 
Similar to a switchboard routing calls to 
authorized destinations, Zscaler only connects 
the right, authorized user or device to a 
particular application.

websites as well as detect unknown threats 
before they reach your network. This minimizes 
the risk of compromise in the first place.

Eliminate lateral movement: Leveraging user\-
to\-app or app\-to\-app segmentation, users 
connect directly to applications (and apps 
to other apps), not the network, eliminating 
the risk of lateral movement. By centralizing 
access control policy management, Zscaler acts 
like a security checkpoint for internet traffic, 
removing pathways for lateral movement. 
Zscaler can also identify and stop potential 
attackers from moving laterally, whether 
external threats or malicious insiders, through 
identity threat detection and response (ITDR) 
and deception capabilities.

Prevent initial compromise: The Zero 
Trust Exchange employs extensive TLS/SSL 
inspection, browser isolation, advanced inline 
sandboxing, and policy\-driven access controls 
to prevent users from accessing malicious 

Stop data loss: Inline data loss prevention 
measures, combined with full TLS/SSL 
inspection, effectively thwart data theft 
attempts. Zscaler ensures that data is secured

These AI\-driven capabilities enable Zscaler to offer robust 

protection against ransomware, ensuring comprehensive security 

for enterprises in the evolving threat landscape:

• AI\-powered phishing and C2 detection uses inline AI\-based 
detection from the Zscaler Secure Web Gateway to identify 

and block never\-before\-seen phishing sites and command\-and\-

• AI\-powered segmentation provides automated access policy 

recommendations to minimize the attack surface and prevent 

lateral movement, using user context, behavior, location, 

and private app telemetry.

• Dynamic, risk\-based policy continuously analyzes the risk 

associated with users, devices, and applications to enforce 

dynamic security and access policies.

• AI\-powered browser isolation creates a secure gap between 
users and malicious web content by rendering pages as 

streams of picture\-perfect images, preventing data leaks and 

the delivery of active threats.

• AI\-driven data discovery and classification provides instant 
data visibility and classification out of the box across 

endpoint, inline, and cloud data, making it more difficult 

for ransomware to target and encrypt sensitive data.

Guidance

A defense strategy rooted in zero trust architecture is a proven security measure for stopping ransomware, but tackling this multifaceted threat 
demands proactive planning, ongoing collaboration, and strategic investments.

ThreatLabz experts have compiled the latest best practices to help reduce ransomware risks and safeguard your organization against existing and 
emerging threats.

Implement regular and secure data 
backups. Ensure all data is backed up 
regularly and securely, including offline 
backups. Adapt backup strategies based 
on evolving threats.

Keep software updated. Apply the latest 
security patches promptly to address 
known vulnerabilities. Use AI\-driven 
threat intelligence platforms to prioritize 
and manage security patches effectively.

Enable multifactor authentication (MFA). 
Add an extra layer of security to user 
accounts with MFA to mitigate the risk 
of unauthorized access. Integrate MFA 
solutions to detect and prevent account 
takeovers effectively.

Establish a consistent corporate security 
policy. Ensure all users follow consistent 
security procedures, including MFA and 
regular security updates, to help prevent 
initial compromises. With a distributed 
workforce, it is even more important to 
implement a security service edge (SSE) 
architecture to protect users no matter 
where they are.

Bolster application security. Remove 
applications from the public internet 
to prevent ransomware actors from 
exploiting vulnerabilities. Implement 
a zero trust architecture for internal 
applications to safeguard them against 
ransomware attempts.

Enforce least\-privileged access. 
Implement least\-privileged policies to 
restrict user access to only the resources 
necessary for their roles. Utilize AI\-powered 
solutions to dynamically analyze user behavior 
and adapt access privileges accordingly.

Strengthen identity protection. 
Use ITDR tools to gain visibility into 
identity misconfigurations, remediate 
vulnerabilities in Active Directory that 
adversaries exploit to escalate privileges 
and move laterally, and detect stealthy 
identity threats.

Inspect all traffic. Today, 86% of threats 
are delivered over encrypted channels, 
which are often not inspected, making it 
easy for even moderately sophisticated 
attackers to bypass security controls. It’s 
essential to inspect all traffic, encrypted 
or not, to prevent compromise.

Implement zero trust network access 
(ZTNA). Deploy granular user\-to\-
application and application\-to\-application 
segmentation, brokering access via 
least\-privileged access controls to 
eliminate lateral movement, minimize 
data exposure, and enhance your overall 
security posture.

33

©2024 Zscaler, Inc. All rights reserved.ThreatLabz 2024 Ransomware ReportUtilize a cloud access security broker 
(CASB). Control and monitor cloud 
application usage with a CASB to prevent 
malicious activities like file downloads and 
data exfiltration.

Provide ongoing employee training. 
Conduct regular security awareness 
training to educate employees about 
ransomware threats. Employ simulations 
of real\-world ransomware scenarios to 
enhance employee preparedness.

Develop a comprehensive ransomware 
response plan. Create a response plan 
encompassing data recovery, incident 
response, and communication protocols 
to act swiftly and effectively in the event 
of a ransomware attack.

Utilize AI\-driven browser isolation. 
Protect users from web threats with AI\-
based isolation of suspicious internet 
content and high\-risk users. By isolating 
the browser experience and restricting 
potentially harmful actions (like inputting 
credentials), users can safely access 
suspicious URLs and files without risking 
their system’s security.

Employ AI\-powered advanced 
sandboxing. Stop never\-before\-seen 
and elusive malware with a sandbox that 
automatically detects and quarantines 
unknown threats and suspicious files 
leveraging AI/ML analysis.

Deploy inline data loss prevention 
(DLP). Safeguard against data exfiltration 
and exposure by deploying inline 
DLP measures.

Leverage deception technology. Employ 
deception tools and honeypots to 
misdirect attackers, fortifying defenses 
against system infiltration.
