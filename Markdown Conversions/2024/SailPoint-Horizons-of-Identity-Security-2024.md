The Horizons of 
Identity Security 
Harnessing the power of identity security 
to bend the cybersecurity value curve

Interactive Book   |   The Horizons of Identity Security

Organizations across sectors around the world 
face a dual challenge: they must counter 
increasingly sophisticated and pervasive 
cyber threats while grappling with constrained 
budgets and relentless cost-cutting.

The pressures are especially intense in identity security, where 
attack surfaces grow and IT budgets tighten as organizations 
scale, yet internal and external stakeholders increasingly demand 
better security and digital experiences. 
Over the last three years, SailPoint has surveyed identity and 
access management (IAM) decision-makers across the globe to 
assess their capabilities across 5 identity security horizons. The 
350 decision-makers we surveyed in July 2024 included senior 
leaders in information technology, cybersecurity, and risk; more 
than half work for organizations with more than 10,000 employees, 
and more than half work in the finance or technology sectors.

future of identity security will be shaped 
by integrated identity programs. 
Key elements are shown here along with  
the trends that complement these elements.

The future of identity will be

BNP Paribas Bank Polska boosted 
productivity with extensive automation 
of manual IAM tasks.

Following a series of mergers, the bank was managing 
10,000 users and about 1,000 applications through 
disjointed IAM programs. Without automation, the 
IT team was unable to cope with the volume of user 
requests or IAM tasks. With automation, all certification 
campaigns are now managed by just two employees, 
each allocating only about 15% of their worktime.
Goal: 
Reduce cyber risk and 
improve productivity
