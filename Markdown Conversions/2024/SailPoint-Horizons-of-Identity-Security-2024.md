## Executive summary
Organizations across sectors around the world face a dual challenge: they must counter increasingly sophisticated and pervasive cyber threats while grappling with constrained budgets and relentless cost-cutting.

The pressures are especially intense in identity security where attack surfaces grow and IT budgets tighten as organizations scale, yet internal and external stakeholders increasingly demand better security and digital experiences.

Employees need quick and easy access to business applications, for example, and customers demand seamless omnichannel interactions; both are less tolerant of usernames and passwords.

Getting identity right is difficult, but it is critical in reducing risk and improving customer experience. The addition of every new customer, employee, contractor, and machine identity presents risks - along with opportunities to create business value. Unlike other cyber capabilities, identity security has the power to secure an organization while transforming the way customers interact with the business. This can lead to real revenue impact, build the trust of customers, employees, and other stakeholders, and yield lasting competitive advantages.

To lobby their organizations for the necessary financial and human resources, IT leaders need to understand and explain what will drive the most value—and use those resources wisely. When it comes to identity security, the case for investment is strong.

Our research and experience suggest that every dollar invested in identity security delivers disproportionately higher returns, “bending” the identity security-to-value curve. These disproportionately higher returns are observed through higher risk reduction, business value, and productivity. Strategic investment in IAM delivers outsized returns by unlocking new value pools such as enhanced capability coverage and data analytics, automation, lower cyber insurance premiums, and improved compliance.

A leading tech retailer, for example, reduced cyber risk by more than two-thirds by setting appropriate privileges for about 6,000 accounts and automating identity security and governance. A major financial institution reduced costs and improved outcomes by implementing an AI-based risk management tool, saving $300 per identity onboarded. A prominent bank improved productivity by automating manual IAM tasks, including 90% of all access requests.

Over the last three years, SailPoint has surveyed identity and access management (IAM) decision-makers across the globe to assess their capabilities across identity security horizons and define the future of identity. The 350 decision-makers we surveyed in July 2024 included senior leaders in information technology, cybersecurity, and risk; more than half work for organizations with more than 10,000 employees, and more than half work in the finance or technology sectors. (For details on survey demographics, please see the Appendix.)

Using their responses, we grouped their organizations into five horizons based on strategy, talent, operating model, and technology capabilities:
- At Horizon 1, the lowest maturity, organizations lack the strategy and technology to enable digital identities
- At Horizon 2, they have adopted some identity technology but still rely heavily on manual processes
- At Horizon 3, they have adopted identity capabilities at scale
- At Horizon 4, they have automated capabilities at scale and use AI to enhance digital identities
- At Horizon 5, the closest to the future of identity, boundaries are blurred between enterprise identity controls and the external identity ecosystem, and identity supports the business in next-gen technology innovations

What we found
Based on our survey of identity security decision-makers and interviews, the following insights and themes emerged:
- Most organizations have significant opportunities to realize the full potential of identity security. Of the organizations we surveyed, 41% remain in Horizon 1. 23% are in Horizon 2, 26% in Horizon 3, and ~10% in Horizons 4 and 5. From 2023 to 2024, only 3% moved beyond Horizon 1, and only 1% from Horizon 3 to 4, suggesting that the full value of identity security remains untapped for the majority of organizations.
- Identity security is core to overall enterprise security. Horizon 3 and 4+ organizations have better overall security posture. For example, they have 50% higher NIST CMMI scores, as compared to Horizon 1 and 2 organizations, suggesting investment in identity is an essential step toward securing organizations at large.
- Organizations that advance to higher identity security horizons can “bend the curve”—delivering disproportionate economic impact. More mature organizations gain disproportionate reductions in risk, higher topline business value, and increased workforce productivity.
- Organizations at Horizon 3 and beyond reduce risk through higher identity coverage. The gap in coverage is especially wide for third-party and machine identities, where the survey showed Horizons 3 and 4 organizations have 20-50% higher coverage of third-party and machine identities.
- Machine identities are growing faster than all other identity types, making coverage of these identities increasingly important for organizations of all maturity levels. Growth is fueled by the increasing use of cloud workloads and AI applications such as copilots, prompts, ML models, and bots that tend to be highly fragmented within organizations and necessitate non-human account access. Organizations at or beyond Horizon 3 are better equipped to secure them, given their higher coverage.
- Mature identity security organizations are twice as likely to use identity data to create actionable security or business intelligence. They use data to enable new use cases, for example, such as intelligent guidance for user access, context-aware security policies, and intelligent access reviews.
- AI-powered use case adoption is relatively low across organizations, though Horizons 1-2 still trail Horizons 3 and 4. About half of those at Horizon 4 have adopted top AI-powered use cases, including role-access reconciliation, adaptive authentication, and privileged access.
- Organizations with mature identity security have the foundations to invest in scalable GenAI-powered use cases. Many Horizon 4 organizations are now developing GenAI capabilities to enhance engineering and expand identity security, whereas Horizon 1-2 organizations tend to prioritize automation of repetitive helpdesk tasks through more mainstream solutions, such as AI chat bots.
- Horizon 3 and 4 organizations scale identity coverage and capabilities without growing their IAM workforces by improving efficiency with advanced IAM solutions and shifting from helpdesk to engineering-led support models.
- Horizon 3 and 4 organizations have 15-50% higher adoption of privileged access governance capabilities. By investing in solutions beyond credential vaulting and session management, they simplify access approval and requests while enhancing threat analytics for privileged accounts.
- Identity security is a key to mitigating increases in insurance premiums. Insurers have improved their risk assessment strategies, while raising premiums to more accurately reflect higher risk profiles. They now assess the security capabilities of nearly every organization before setting premiums. Demonstrating advanced identity security maturity helps reduce cyber insurance premiums.
- Identity-related regulations have grown sevenfold since 2010 globally across regions and industries. As a result, organizations must invest in maturing identity security capabilities to navigate complex regulatory landscapes and ensure compliance.

Advancing identity security requires focused resources - time, money, talent, and the attention of senior leaders - the costs of inaction can be far higher.

The value of identity security will continue to rise as cyber threats multiply; legislators, regulators, investors, and insurers raise their security expectations; and customers, employees, and business partners increasingly seek trusted and seamless digital experiences.

Advancing identity security requires focused resources - time, money, talent, and the attention of senior leaders - and the costs of inaction can be far higher. Gaps in identity security can slow digital transformations and cloud migrations, complicate mergers and divestitures, stifle innovation, and attract bad actors. One negative identity experience can mean losing a customer forever; a major breach can have catastrophic financial and reputational consequences.

The good news is that organizations that harness the power of identity can overcome these challenges and deliver disproportionately higher returns. A unified approach to identity - encompassing data, operations, and users - can reduce risk, enhance business value, and drive substantial improvements in business productivity.

Identity drives disproportionately higher returns and enables organizations to build trust with customers, employees, and partners, expanding total economic benefits and competitive advantages.

## Advances in technology will shape the future of identity security
Chapter 1:

In the last few years, our experience and research have confirmed that the future of identity security will be shaped by integrated identity programs. The pillars of next-generation identity security include:
- Integration across diverse technology environments: Unified access controls provide visibility across all identity types, integrate with security operations, and support machine identity management and actionable intelligence.
- Dynamic trust models: Zero-trust architecture and AI-driven access models enable dynamic authorization, adjusting permissions based on behavior and context-aware policies.
- Federated identities: Federated access allows organizations to manage diverse identities across digital environments, enhancing security and user experience, with early adoption of decentralized protocols and digital wallets.
- Frictionless access: Automated privileged access and password-less authentication using passkeys, biometrics, and certificates ensure seamless and secure user authentication.

Over the past year, three trends have emerged that complement these pillars of the future of identity:
- Machine identity management: With the rise of AI and automated bots, organizations need to manage more non-human accounts, such as those used by copilots and machine learning models.
- Integrated identity data layer: An integrated data layer is key to generating actionable intelligence and insights, exemplified by the development of context-rich identity graphs to create unified employee and customer profiles.
- Context-aware policy enforcement: Access decisions are increasingly driven by AI-powered analytics, which use context-aware policies to enhance security through anomaly detection, identity pattern recognition, and behavior analysis.

Organizations can use these forward-thinking capabilities to set the north star vision for their identity security strategy, which can guide innovative initiatives and capabilities that improve identity security outcomes and create value for customers, employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders.

The future of identity will be defined by 4 key elements

**Federated identities**
Federated access is becoming more mainstream across identity types, including managing identities across digital environments
Several identity personas starting with workforce, business partner, and machines converging under identity security control plane offering enhanced security, user experience, insights, and reporting
Decentralized identity protocols are earlier stage, with adoption of digital wallets and access distributed across multiple environments

Evolving regulatory and risk landscape continues to shape these four elements

Identity security fabric will become the nerve center of future security operations – IT workloads are complex and transcend network, infra, and geographic perimeters while cyber attacks have become even more sophisticated in exploiting any fault points in security posture. In that context, identity security fabric will protect beyond network perimeter, identifying the blast radius of any incident, detecting the compromise, and responding fast to contain and recover.

Proliferation of identity security related regulations and industry standards across the globe and across industries is expected to drive increased expectations on identity security controls and compliance.

_Note: Accelerated adoption of AI 'copilots' and decision-support models may enhance security, user experience, and developer efficiency for building and maintaining scalable identity security platforms, while introducing risks, such as the potential for AI-driven identity compromise._

## Investments in identity security can “bend the curve”
Chapter 2:

Organizations with mature identity security deliver disproportionately higher returns for every dollar spent
Exhibit 3:

Our 2024 survey of identity security decision-makers shows that organizations that invest to reach mature identity security get disproportionately higher returns. Spending on cybersecurity, like many other investments, typically delivers linear returns. However, the IAM maturity-to-value curve grows exponentially, as shown in the exhibit [below], meaning organizations in Horizons 3 and 4 reap compounding benefits from increasingly mature identity ecosystems.

This should drive a major shift in the way organizations think about investing in cybersecurity capabilities—and suggests that investments in IAM may deliver more value than investments in other cyber capabilities.

In the exhibit [above], value is plotted against maturity, where maturity is measured across the Horizons of identity security. We measure return, or value, as a function of Total Economic Impact (TEI), calculating it based on how an organization scores in three dimensions—risk reduction, business value, and workforce productivity—as it moves across horizons.

For example, Horizon 4 organizations have lower risk as measured by fewer identity-related security issues, generate more business value through accelerated digital transformations, and increase productivity by automating IAM. We normalize these discrete findings across risk, business value, and workforce productivity and then compile them into an aggregate TEI score. In this section, we detail our findings for the three dimensions where organizations see disproportionately higher returns with increased maturity.

Risk reduction: Moving through identity security horizons reduces the attack surface for potential breaches
Exhibit 4:

Organizations disproportionately reduce risk as they progress through horizons. In the exhibit [above], risk reduction is plotted against maturity, where higher Horizon organizations see larger reductions in risk. According to the survey results, 63% of organizations that invest to reach mature identity security see on average more than 10% (and up to 30%) reduction in identity-related security issues, while lower-maturity organizations severely lag behind.

While it is no surprise that investments in capabilities reduce identity-related security issues, the reductions are significantly higher for Horizon 3 and 4 organizations. These organizations are better equipped to shrink attack surfaces and minimize the blast radius of incidents.

Business value: Organizations with advanced identity capabilities experience faster time to market and reduced friction
Exhibit 5:

Organizations with advanced identity security capabilities can drive topline revenue impact by accelerating product time to market. In our survey, IT leaders were asked to what extent the implementation of identity management solutions accelerated digital transformation within their organizations. The exhibit [below] plots their responses against maturity, where Horizon 3 and 4 responses for digital transformation acceleration are on average 16% higher than Horizon 1 responses. We found that advanced identity security accelerates digital transformations, enabling faster development cycles and speed to market, increasing revenue. Horizon 3 and 4 organizations do this while providing the same level of security and reducing friction for users, as shown in the exhibit [below].

Productivity: Horizons 3 and 4+ organizations are likely to see significant productivity gains
Exhibit 6:

Organizations that reach mature identity security experience significantly higher productivity gains from IAM automation use cases. In our survey, IT leaders were asked how the implementation of IAM automation use cases affected the productivity of their front-line users. The exhibit [below] plots their responses against maturity, where Horizon 4 responses for productivity gains were 22% higher than Horizon 1 responses. Front-line users in Horizon 3 and 4 organizations get faster access when joining the company or changing roles, for example, and they spend less time on non-revenue-generating activities such as compliance-driven access reviews and approvals. As a result, these users can spend more time on core activities that create business value.

Organizations can leapfrog to Horizons 3 and 4 by adopting a unified approach across data, operations, and users, and deploying scalable solutions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments. The benefits are substantial, including scaling identity security capabilities and lowering cyber risk without increasing the relative size of the IAM team.

Scalable identity security solutions are essential for organizations aiming to reach Horizons 3 and 4. These solutions should scale with growth in the number of identities governed, especially for machine identities, which survey results suggest have low levels of coverage today but will grow the fastest. With scalable solutions, organizations can maintain the effectiveness of their identity security measures as their digital ecosystems expand.

Investments in identity security are not a cost center—they are a strategic imperative that can yield disproportionately higher returns across risk reduction, productivity, and business value. Committed investments in identity security help organizations safeguard their assets and gain competitive advantages in the digital age.

## Where organizations are in their journeys and why mature organizations deliver higher returns?
Chapter 3:

The SailPoint Horizons maturity framework
SailPoint categorizes identity security programs into five maturity horizons based on an organization’s maturity across four enablement areas: strategy, technology & tools, operating model, and talent.
Exhibit 7:

Over three years of annual surveys, we clustered key criteria into five maturity horizons guided by survey results
Based on interviews and a new survey of 350+ IAM decision makers across the globe, we explored where organizations stand in their identity security journeys and how they have progressed since last year. Our research helps explain why increasing identity security maturity yields disproportionately higher returns across risk reduction, business value, and productivity. Taken together, these perspectives illustrate where organizations have excelled, the barriers they face, and how they can move to the next maturity horizon.

Most organizations have only begun their identity security journeys
Despite some progress, most organizations remain in the early stages of their identity security journeys, including more than 40% still in Horizon 1, as shown in the exhibit [below]. Horizon 2 saw moderate growth in 2024, and some organizations moved from Horizon 3 into Horizon 4 by adopting a unified approach to identity security across environments and investing in leading-edge tools that generate actionable identity insights.

The slow pace of progress is due in part to pressure on cyber and IT budgets. In an era of cost-cutting, identity security professionals face challenges deploying and maintaining comprehensive identity security ecosystems. And almost every organization is finding it more difficult to attract and retain tech talent. That said, the slow but steady progress toward Horizon 4 and 5 indicates that organizations are finding ways to bolster their capabilities in pursuit of enhanced security and value to the business.

Organizations that invest in mature identity security see disproportionately higher returns because of unique capabilities across nine themes
Organizations with mature identity security share important characteristics, including higher security coverage of non-employee identities. By scaling their capabilities to address specific security needs for each identity type, organizations in Horizon 3 and beyond minimize vulnerabilities, detect and address high-risk account settings, and enhance overall security posture.

Survey results show that machine identities are likely to grow faster than any other identity class, driven by expanding cloud workloads and AI use cases that require non-human account access. Given past survey results indicate machine identities already represent more than 40% of total identities within an organization, securing them will become even more critical to mitigate cyber threats. Horizon 1 and 2 organizations need to incorporate machine identities into their security roadmaps or risk falling behind.

All identities are expected to grow roughly 14% in the next 3-5 years, with machine identities growing the fastest

Horizon 3 and 4 organizations have scaled up coverage for machine identities in particular, while most in Horizons 1 and 2 remain focused on coverage for employee identities. With higher coverage across identity types, Horizon 3 and 4 organizations are in better positions to adapt to the ever-evolving threat landscape, where expanding identities and types present additional security risks.

In addition to their higher coverage across identity types, organizations in Horizon 4 are significantly more adept at using identity data to create actionable intelligence and unlock additional value from their identity security investments. About 50% of Horizon 4 organizations use intelligent guidance for user access and intelligent access reviews, for example, compared to fewer than 40% of those in Horizon 3 and just 20% of those in Horizons 1-2.

More accurate and timely access decisioning, enabled by better use of identity data, is a key to reducing security risks. And significant productivity gains arise from streamlined access reviews and lower authentication friction. Horizon 4 organizations serve as a model for how organizations in Horizons 1-2 can harness identity data.
