Introduction
Our job of protecting digital identities continues to grow 
in complexity and scope as the number of identity\-related 
incidents rises in every category. With issues like identity sprawl, 
and system complexity, CISOs and organizations at large need 
to find effective ways to protect the identity information of their 
employees, vendors, partners, and customers. 
To explore the current state of cybersecurity, we commissioned 
a study with Dimensional Research to understand the 
approaches large companies are taking toward security and 
identity. The study invited independent security and identity 
professionals across the United States, who were asked 
questions focused on their current plans, identity and security 
history, and more. 521 qualified individuals completed the 
survey.All had deep knowledge of IT security and identity from 
an organization with over 1,000 employees. 
The research finds that as the number of identities increases 
(identity sprawl), more businesses are suffering identity\-related 
incidents and are identifying securing them as a top priority. 
We continue to see that securing these identities remains a 
significant challenge, and security outcomes remain a large 
work in progress. 
Lets start by exploring the state of identity and security and 
then dig into some security challenges and necessary outcomes.

2024 Trends\|Research
The State of Identity and Security in 2024
Our research found that 22% of businesses see managing and securing digital identities as the number one 
priority of their security program, up from 17% in 2023\. More than half of respondents (51%) said they now see it 
as a top three priority, and another 18% see security digital identity as a top five priority. Only 2% of businesses 
dont see securing identities as a top 10 priority. This trend of increasing priority is a positive sign of the 
recognition of the importance of identity.
The increased focus on security digital 
identities is not surprising given the 
emergence of identity sprawl. Over 
half (57%) of the respondents consider 
managing identity sprawl a major focus.
This increase in digital identities comes 
with the cost of increases in cyber\-attacks 
targeting them.

2024 Trends\|Research
The most significant reason behind this increase was phishing at 69%, up from 62% in 2023\. Coming in at a 
distant second was stolen credentials, also increased from 2023\. As indicated in the chart below, a large 
variety of attacks accounted for around one\-quarter to one\-third of incidents experienced.
Employee behavior continues to affect 
identity\-related incidents. Most organizations 
are concerned about employees using 
corporate credentials for social media.
84% of identity stakeholders said incidents 
directly impacted their business. This is a 
notable increase from 68% in 2023\. The most 
significant impact, seeing a measurable rise 
this year, was distracting from core business 
(52%), followed by the cost of recovering from 
the breach.

2024 Trends\|Research
This dropped from number one last year yet increased from 33% to 47%. Close behind and keeping third place 
is the negative impact on the companys reputation with a whopping increase from 25% to 45%. We should not 
ignore the creeping increase in customer attrition from identity\-related incidents, up to 24%.
The surprising increase in the number of times an organization invoked its incident response plans tells us 
that the number almost doubled this year to 91%. 48% invoked their plans more than once and 3% remained 
without any plan.

Ongoing Challenges of Identity Security
Our research found that one of the biggest challenges for security teams was the sheer number of barriers they 
now face. This year, the top two reasons at 38% were complex technology environments and insufficient budget 
(up from 30%). Respondents also identified people at 34%, up from 25% last year.
Tied to the 34% of respondents that indicate not enough people, the top two planned investments focus 
on more timely access reviews. Implementation of MFA comes in next. Looking at user behavior and device 
characteristics provides the opportunity for innovation, while many of the other planned investments form the 
foundation for zero trust, whether or not that is the plan.

2024 Trends\|Research
An increased majority of identity stakeholders (69%) said their companys security identity capabilities were 
well managed, and 8% continue to say they were optimal. Less than one quarter (22%) only believe their 
company has basic security identity capabilities.

How 2024 Trends Are Impacting Identity Security
The study found that the majority of businesses (89%) are somewhat or very concerned that new privacy 
regulations will impact their identity security. This is consistent with last year and may be why cyber insurance for 
identity\-related incidents remains consistent, with 52% of businesses having already invested and 29% planning 
to, similar to last year.
One reason these numbers are holding steady may be that only 31% of those surveyed expect cyber insurance to 
cover the cost of breach remedies.

The research also explored the technologies required to address identity security challenges. For example, 
respondents were asked about the use cases they perceived as having the most benefit from artificial 
intelligence and machine learning. Identity and security stakeholders consistently (96%, down slightly) report 
AIML will be beneficial. The number one use case was identifying outlier behaviors (71% up from 63%), 
followed by evaluating the severity of alerts (60% up from 56%), and making administrative tasks more 
efficient (56% up from 52%).
Identity stakeholders continue to see passwordless authentication as a tool in addressing identity issues, with 
81% saying its a great or solid technology. Respondents were also consistent in their answers about phishing\-
resistant multi\-factor authentication (MFA), with 82% saying its a great or solid technology for the future.

Security Outcomes Remain A Work In Progress
Identity stakeholders also provided insight into their companys level of implementation of identity\-related 
security outcomes. The most advanced outcome was the implementation of MFA for all users, a common theme 
throughout the research at 52% fully implemented. Granting access according to the principle of least privilege 
was at 41% fully implemented. Many of the outcomes are in progress.
Looking back at the identity\-related incidents encountered, 93% of identity stakeholders said security outcomes 
could have lessened the business impact of incidents. That number is down slightly this year, although remains 
strong. As it was last year, implementing Multi\-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users is reported to have the 
greatest chance to minimize the business impact of an incident. Going back to basics with routine, timely access 
reviews are solidly in second and third place.

2024 Trends\|Research
99% of businesses, the highest percentage in the history of our research, plan to further invest in security outcomes 
in the next 12 months. Top of the list is ensuring more timely reviews of privileged access (50%) and access to 
sensitive data (43%). Businesses also continue to increase investment in MFA for all users (37%).

2024 Trends\|Research
Looking at some more current technologies, respondents felt similarly about passwordless authentication, 
biometric authentication, and phishing\-resistant MFA with 78%\-82% saying that the technology is solid or great.

Prioritize Securing Identities With IDSA
Securing digital identities is a critical priority for organizations across all sectors in the fight 
against ever\-evolving and increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Our research finds that 
businesses increasingly recognize the risk of identity\-related incidents and prioritize the dangers 
in their security programs.
More involvement and investment from senior leadership teams continue to be required to help 
businesses address these threats. Companies must also address the complexity of their systems 
and technology architectures and gain access to security expertise and standards to help them 
better manage their risk. To do that, security teams need to ensure they have the right processes, 
tools, technologies, and communication to discover and mitigate identity security threats as 
quickly as possible.

The primary research goal is to identify the experiences and approaches toward security and 
identities at large companies.
Independent sources of security and identity professionals in the United States were invited to 
participate in an online survey. A variety of questions were asked on history with identities and 
security, current plans, and other topics. Certain questions were repeated from similar surveys 
conducted over the previous four years to enable trend analysis. 
A total of 521 qualified individuals completed the survey. All were directly responsible 
for IT security or identities at a company with more than 1,000 employees and were very 
knowledgeable about both IT security and identities.
