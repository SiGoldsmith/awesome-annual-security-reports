## The New Frontier of Access Management and Identity Security
In exploring the future, we’re often drawn to predicting 
the unknown. Our quest for answers is unending, and 
we rely heavily on data to guide our predictions. 
Organizations today navigate a treacherous digital 
landscape where the motives of attackers are as 
varied as their methods — ranging from financial gains, 
cyber espionage, and disruption to reputation damage 
to cyber warfare. Concurrently, these organizations 
also manage various internal complexities, from the 
intricacies of their IT stacks to dispersed hybrid 
workforces and a great variety of devices accessing 
their systems and applications. This evolution from ad 
hoc remote work setups to hybrid work models has 
extended the traditional enterprise perimeter to the far 
corners of the cyber realm.

Years ago, protecting an IT infrastructure might have 
been largely about ensuring that systems were running 
smoothly — the proverbial “keeping the lights on.” Now, 
the remit has expanded exponentially; it encompasses 
a vigilant defense against a host of external cyber 
threats, from ransomware to state-sponsored hacking. 
As the threat landscape has widened, so has the 
surface area for attacks, with every employee’s access 
or device becoming a potential entry point. This shift 
has transformed IT departments from units concerned 
primarily with operational uptime to essential guardians 
against a spectrum of sophisticated external threats.

While we can’t tell precisely what the future will bring, 
analyzing historical patterns provides insights into 
future possibilities. For instance, the previous edition 
of the Trusted Access Report pointed out the soaring 
adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) as 
companies have been looking to reduce risk in a more 
advanced security landscape.  

As organizations grapple with increasingly sophisticated 
cybersecurity threats, a demand for holistic access 
management solutions has been apparent for a 
few years. MFA is a great security measure, but not 
enough on its own.  More sophisticated threats call for 
additional layers of security. 

By integrating context, an access management solution 
can analyze the situation in which access is being 
requested, such as information about the user’s typical 
behavior or environment including their usual login 
times, geolocation and device.  This adds an additional 
layer of security, providing a more holistic and dynamic 
approach to authentication. 

In essence, adding context to the authentication 
process allows systems to better differentiate between 
legitimate users and potential threats, enhancing 
security while maintaining a good user experience. 
Thus, context becomes the new form of MFA.

Introduction

MFA is a great security measure, but not 
enough on its own.  More sophisticated 
threats call for additional layers of security.

Contextual factors such as location or device details 
(operating systems, for example) have been included  
in Trusted Access Reports for years. However, with 
hybrid work as a firmly ingrained reality, the importance 
of contextual factors carries even more weight.

Another area where we have detected a rising level of 
interest is the future of identity; more specifically ways 
of addressing proliferation of digital identities from the 
cybersecurity perspective.

In the modern workplace, every employee may have 
multiple digital identities across various systems, 
applications, and platforms. This can range from email 
accounts, to access credentials for internal systems,  
to profiles on collaboration platforms like Slack.  
As businesses continue to adopt cloud services, 
software-as-a-service platforms, and remote 
collaboration tools, the number of these digital  
 identities grows. This proliferation has significant 
implications for both productivity and security.

On one hand, these identities can enable more 
seamless collaboration and access to necessary 
resources, improving efficiency. On the other hand, 
managing these numerous identities and ensuring  
they are properly secured becomes a complex task.  
Risk visibility across an organization’s identity 
ecosystem in a single, comprehensive interface  
has become a must.

This can be achieved via identity threat detection and 
response (ITDR) capabilities.  The evolution of ITDR is 
integral to the future of identity, ensuring that our digital 
identities remain secure as they become increasingly 
prevalent in our day-to-day lives.

The challenge is clear: as the MFA usage continues to 
expand globally, so do attackers’ methods. To minimize 
chances of a breach, traditional MFA does not only 
need to be enhanced with contextual factors such as 
the user’s typical behavior or environment but also the 
visibility across an organization’s identity ecosystem  
in a single, comprehensive interface.

## Key Findings
### Stronger Auth Methods Show Upward Trends
Authenticator apps like Duo mobile appeal to both demand for higher security and ease-of-use, 
with 91.5% of accounts enabling Duo Push as a factor accounting for 21% or over 3.2 billion 
authentications. We also observed a decreasing trend in SMS and phone calls as a factor, 
dipping to an all-time-low with 4.9% of authentications—a 22% decrease from 2022.

### Return-to-Office is the New Hybrid Work Reality
Last year, access to remote access applications fell to nearly 25% of authentications after 
peaking in 2020. The quantity of authentications in this category has continued to decline  
since then as more companies move staff back into the office.

### MFA Usage Continues to Expand Globally
The number of MFA authentications using Duo rose by 41% in the past year, with countries like 
Germany seeing a 52.3% increase in authentications year over year. In the Asia-Pacific region, 
Japan, the Philippines, and Australia saw continued growth from last year, increasing by 28%, 
24.9%, and 16.9% respectively. Brazil makes the third-highest increase in authentications  
seeing26.3% more MFA usage from 2022.

### Diverse Device Environments Require Vendor-Agnostic Security
While Windows continues to lead the pack comprising 38.2% of access devices, we note that 
iOS is a strong second at 33.4% in the overall operating system ranking. Apple continues to rule 
the roost in the mobile category amongst Duo users, with the nearest contender being Android, 
which has a far lower adoption rate at 28.2%.  Eliminating potential security gaps,  
vendor-agnostic security also allows for greater flexibility and scalability as the security  
system can easily adapt to changes in the device environment.

## Methodology
In this report, we’ll delve into insights drawn from an 
analysis of over 16 billion authentications in the last  
year (and over 44B in the last 4 years), spanning nearly 
52 million different browsers, on 58 million endpoints  
and 21 million unique phones across regions including 
North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, 
and the Asia Pacific. We defined our 2023 annual time  
range as between June 1, 2022, and May 31, 2023.

### Key Findings
#### Organizations are putting in stricter controls reducing risk of out-of-date software
The percentage of failures due to out-of-date devices increased by 74.7% in 2023.  
The more operating systems (OS) an organization allows to authenticate, the more likely it is 
those authentications will occur with an out-of-date OS.  Organizations – particularly those 
which are expanding their IT environments – are increasingly putting in stricter controls, aiming 
to reduce risks posed by out-of-date software.

#### Failed Authentications Highlight User Risks
5% of all measured authentications were ones that failed. When we further examined the data, 
we discovered that 28% of the failed authentications were due to the users not being enrolled in 
the system. Unenrolled users may gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or critical systems, 
leading to data breaches.

#### Top 3 Policy Groups to Reduce Security Debt
One of the most effective strategies for mitigating security debt is through the comprehensive 
management of risk. Policies addressing geo-restrictions, unsecure devices, and granular per-
user or per-application access can help reduce complexity and increase security coverage. 
However, 96.4% of organizations have no policy related to location (allow, deny, or require 2FA).

#### Identity is The New Perimeter
Without proper visibility, threat detection, and response, identity infrastructure provides ample 
opportunity for attackers to enter critical systems. In 23% of engagements observed by Talos 
IR, attackers were able to abuse compromised credentials to access valid accounts[^1]. The 
average company has 40.26% of accounts with either no MFA or a weak MFA[^2].

In an environment where sophisticated cyberattacks have become the norm, an 
access management solution needs to be enhanced with identity threat detection  
and response capabilities, offering visibility across an organization’s identity 
ecosystem in a single, comprehensive interface.

## Billions of Authentications
### MFA continues to strengthen passwords
Multi-factor authentication holds strong while adding to the security of traditional password 
usage. The number of MFA authentications using Duo rose by 41% in the past year.

### Push preferred
Duo Push is the most-used authentication method, accounting for 21% of all authentications.

### Passwordless adoption continues to rise
Account adoption of WebAuthn-enabled factors, including security keys and biometric 
technology like TouchID, increased by 53% from 2022 to 2023 alone.

## Stronger Auth Methods Show Upward Trends
The weaknesses of passwords as a sole authentication method are well-documented. They can 
be guessed, cracked, phished, or stolen, and users often exacerbate these vulnerabilities by 
reusing passwords across multiple services or creating simple, easily decipherable passwords. 
In contrast, multi-factor authentication (MFA) mitigates these risks by introducing additional 
hurdles for potential attackers. Even if a password is compromised, the chances of an attacker 
also having access to the user’s physical device or biometric information are significantly lower.

However, recent high-profile cyber-attacks have shown that simply enabling a second factor 
does not make an account impenetrable. Not all authenticators are born equal, with factors like 
FIDO2 security keys and WebAuthn-enabled biometrics proving harder to exploit compared to 
weaker, but more accessible, factors like SMS text or phone call.

Luckily, authenticator apps like Duo Mobile appeal to both demand for higher security and  
ease-of-use. 91.5% of accounts enable Duo Push, a one-tap authentication available via the  
Duo Mobile application, accounting for 21% or over 3.2 billion authentications. We also observed 
a decreasing trend in SMS texts and phone calls as a factor, dipping to an all-time-low with  
4.9% of authentications — a 22% decrease from 2022. More secure methods like WebAuthn 
and hard tokens take their place as the benefits of phishing-resistant MFA and smarter access 
policies gain traction amongst SMB and enterprises alike.

## Return-to-Office is the New Hybrid Work Reality
![Figure 05 Authentications for Remote Access Applications]
Figure 05 Authentications for Remote Access Applications
Remote access applications are software apps that allow a user to remotely access and control 
another computer or network over the internet or a local network connection. These apps are 
used for various purposes including troubleshooting, file transfers, remote administration, or 
accessing files and software on an office computer from a remote location.

Last year, the number of authentications for remote access applications 
reached nearly 25%. This is lower than pre-pandemic levels after the  
peak we saw in 2020. The quantity of authentications in this category  
has continued to decline since then as more companies move staff back 
into the office. While we observe a lower volume of authentications across 
the board during the December and January holiday periods, several 
industries including education, retail, and healthcare spiked during the  
first calendar quarter.

### Let’s set the scene...
With the return of business travel, designated in-office policy, or even just flu season, 
predictable ebb and flow of authentication requests begin to fluctuate. The cadence breaks as 
employees take leave, work remotely, or operate on varied schedules. These changes can lead 
to a surge in remote access requests, with employees reaching out to corporate networks from 
a multitude of locations and devices, not just their usual work terminals. Consequently, the IT 
systems must handle an influx of mixed on-premises and off-site login attempts with a greater 
reliance on VPNs and other remote access technologies.

Moreover, seasonality can also bring about an increase in temporary staff as businesses scale 
up to meet demand. This influx requires the creation and management of additional temporary 
credentials, a wave of new entries into the authentication system. Once the season wanes, 
there’s a corresponding outflow as these seasonal credentials are revoked.

This variance does not merely alter the volume, but also the nature of authentications. There is 
a heightened need for robust security measures as the risk of cyber threats often spikes during 
these times. Thus, a layered security approach becomes even more crucial — with MFA as a 
minimum requirement.  

During these peak times, the IT environment’s authentication protocols must be both elastic 
and secure, expanding to accommodate the increased and varied load while maintaining the 
integrity of the system. IT staff remain on high alert to watch for any anomalous activity that 
could signify a breach attempt.

## Futureproofing Against Attackers
The identity threat landscape is rapidly evolving, and trusted identity providers have fallen  
under attack. According to CISA, attackers are actively exploiting identity policy gaps to gain 
access to critical applications. Regardless of the increased risk, 85% of organizations feel  
they are not prepared and ready to protect themselves against modern attacks according to  
the Cisco Secure Readiness Index study[^3].

Visibility across the identity infrastructure is a must-have when addressing the types of attacks 
adversaries concoct. While there’s been a significant uptick amongst MFA authentications 
through Duo, another piece of research suggests that security gaps are still across the market: 
the average company has 40% of accounts with either no MFA or weak MFA[^4]. Especially 
in periods of change, strong access management and identity visibility is critical. For brief 
moments you might strike the right balance, only to be disrupted by new and emerging threats, 
changing user behavior, and a complex IT environment.

This is why modern security initiatives require continuous monitoring across identity, critical 
applications, and human resources information system (HRIS) versus a “set it and forget it” 
approach. As the security landscape evolves, many businesses are adopting a zero trust  
access policy strategy to mitigate modern attack surfaces. Organizations with a mature  
zero trust implementation score 30% higher in security resiliency than organizations without  
a zero trust strategy[^5].
01
02
In 2023, we saw a proliferation of two specific types of MFA-targeting attacks taking 
advantage of push-based authentications and unassuming users:

*   **Push harassment** 
    Multiple successive push notifications to bother a user into accepting a 
    push for a fraudulent login attempt.
*   **Push fatigue** 
    Constant MFA means users pay less attention to the details of their login, 
    causing a user to mindlessly accept a push login request. 

Duo already supports WebAuthn FIDO2 authenticators, which offer the strongest protection 
against MFA-based attacks. However, we know that rolling passwordless out across an 
organization is a journey. It’s encouraging to see that Duo Verified Push, a more flexible step-up 
factor that became generally available to all Duo customers during the data period of this report, 
was enabled on over 5,600 accounts.

As attackers’ techniques become more sophisticated, a multi-layered defense system is crucial.

and finally Mature, based on their preparedness across five keypillars and the state of deployment of 19 security solutions within those

Trust in users is essential, but no longer enough. The addition of outside 
vendors and contractors adds complexity to closed, managed endpoint-only 
access policy. Duo Trusted Endpoints, made available to all Duo editions, adds 
an extra layer of security even if an organization cannot manage the device 
directly.  Administrators can define a trust policy for every endpoint—whether 
managed or unmanaged, company-issued, contractor-owned, or personal—
and stop attacker’s unknown devices even if they are able to bypass MFA.

Increased friction often appears as a challenge to user adoption. As part of 
balancing security with productivity, we enhanced Duo Remembered Devices 
to account for changes in risk: when we recognize the device a user is on,  
we use a securely generated device token to authenticate so long as trust  
is maintained. 

While access security should be tailored to the level of risk,  
organizations can struggle to get buy-in to add friction for every login.  
Duo’s Risk-Based Authentication solution addresses this challenge—only 
stepping up to the more secure method when environment risk signals  
indicate there are potential threats, like location anomalies or known attack 
patterns. Whether security teams enable Verified Duo Push for all users, or 
through a risk-based approach, this allows organizations to make access 
security decisions based on their risk appetite and organization’s needs.

IT teams must ensure that their Identity Security program is built on a strong 
foundation with the right tools, like strong MFA factors and intelligent step-up. 
Once these tools and policies are in place, Identity Threat Detection and 
Response (ITDR) can bolster an organization’s identity security posture by 
arming the IT security professionals with both proactive and reactive tools.

ITDR helps proactively detect policy misconfigurations, identity-provider-to-HRIS discrepancies, 
and excessive privileges. It can also catch high-risk scenarios such as dormant or inactive 
accounts and accounts with MFA disabled—a trend noted in the 2023 Cisco Talos ‘Year in Review’ 
Report[^6]. On the reactive side, the tool equips IT teams to respond to suspicious activities such as 
new MFA device registration, risky SSO sessions, superman (unrealistic travel) logins, access from 
a new device or location and more.

## Attack Surface Increase
### The Continuing Rise in Global MFA Usage
Data shows that the global customer base protected by Duo’s  
multi-factor authentication security is continuing to grow. The number  
of MFA authentications using Duo rose by 41% in the past year, with 
countries like Germany seeing a 52.3% increase in authentications year 
over year. In the Asia-Pacific region, Japan, the Philippines, and Australia 
saw continued growth from last year, increasing by 28%, 24.9%, and 16.9% 
respectively. For the first year measured, Brazil makes the third highest 
increase in authentications seeing 26.3% more MFA usage from 2022.

This indicates a rising trend in the recognition of the importance of 
enhanced security measures predominantly as a response to a rising 
volume of cyber threats, but also as a reflection of international  
compliance requirements such as GDPR, C5, AgID, or HIPAA.

In figure 7 we revisit a statistic we looked at last year, which is the geographic diversity  
from which an organization operates. In particular, we look at the average number of countries 
that we see users authenticate from when an organization is found in, say, Hong Kong.  
With continued diversification and spread of business interests, Hong Kong saw the highest 
average spread of authentication across 5.6 different countries on average. Organizations  
in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom saw authentications come in from  
an average of 4 different countries — a 72% jump from the 1.5 to 1.75 different countries  
on average seen last year.

An internationally dispersed workforce means more employees, contractors, clients, and third 
parties can access the organization’s business’s digital infrastructure from various locations, 
often on different devices, networks, and operating systems which can introduce additional 
vulnerabilities. Data and resources can be accessed from a greater scale of networks and 
endpoints. This helps support the concept that ‘identity is the new perimeter’ and ‘context 
is the new MFA.’ Identity security is a forever evolving problem and it’s a daunting task for 
organizations to plug every hole the user journey creates.

In addition, an international presence does not only increase the variety in technology stack, but 
it can also add a wider array to the physical challenges of a more geographically diverse user 
base. Also, IT systems must cater to mixed tech stacks and varying data protection and privacy 
laws. This pushes the complexity that IT teams need to deal with yet another notch.

Globalization, like the organization size, increases the probability of a presence of more than 
one identity provider. Moreover, large organizations may acquire other companies, each of 
which may have its own existing identity provider. Instead of consolidating everything under 
one identity provider, which can be complex and disruptive, organizations sometimes choose to 
maintain multiple identity providers.

Managing identities increases in complexity with greater probabilities of supporting more 
than one identity provider (IdP). Without proper security measures in place, this can lead to 
potential security gaps or vulnerabilities that can be exploited for identity-based attacks like 
compromised credentials. 

Global business practice requires broader, vendor-agnostic access management  
that helps organizations detect, respond to, and report attacks.

## Identity is The New Perimeter
Identity security is a key part of access management. Securing and verifying identities allows an 
identity and access management (IAM) system to manage access to resources effectively and 
securely. Because of this, it’s important to spend a few moments highlighting identity-security 
trends that have come to light when we were pulling together this report.

There are a few reasons why gaps in identity security occur. For some companies, the prompt 
comes from cloud migration. As companies grow and move their operations to the cloud, 
they often need to introduce new IAM systems but do not completely deprecate older IAM 
systems. For other companies it is migration from an on-premises directory to a cloud-based 
directory but keeping both. And the third group is composed of companies that have acquired 
one or more companies and support numerous identity platforms.

Another contributing factor comes in the form of operational challenges. Identity security  
often falls under the IT function and may not receive the attention and resources it  
needs to be effective. It requires investment in technology and personnel to manage  
and continuously monitor the IAM systems, ensure compliance with regulations, and  
respond to security incidents.

For some, cloud migrations and organizational scaling require the introduction of new IAM 
systems. Mergers and acquisitions, operational globalization, and a geographically diverse user 
base add even more complexity to keeping track of authenticating identities.

In the face of digital transformation, identity security may suffer from a lack of resources or 
prioritization — typically bucketed as an IT function rather than a security one. Without proper 
visibility and threat detection, identity infrastructure provides ample opportunity for attackers 
to gain entry to critical systems. Identity has traditionally been managed by an organization’s IT 
teams. With identity being a top attack vector, it’s critical to bring together identity teams and 
the Security Operations Center (SOC) with ITDR so everyone is on the same page.

## The Talos Perspective
Cyber attackers are agile and often backed by substantial resources, 
including state sponsorship. This has led to an increase in advanced 
persistent threats which can target identities to gain access to  
sensitive information.

But this is nothing new. Attackers have targeted identities in their campaigns 
for many years. For example, on-premises identity directories or VPNs that 
lack additional protections have fallen victim to several attacks. Managing 
an increased range of identities is also an indicator of expanded attack 
surface. Talos Incident Response (Talos IR) has repeatedly seen attackers 
targeting vendor and contractor accounts (VCAs), which typically have 
expanded privileges and access. VCAs are often overlooked during  
account audits due to trust placed in the third party, making them an  
easy target for attackers.

The Talos 2023 Year in Review report saw compromised credentials 
on valid accounts making up 23% of initial access vectors, with use of 
valid accounts as the second-most common MITRE ATT&CK technique 
observed[^7]. While one major vulnerability is improperly implemented MFA 
or lack thereof, in some engagements attackers were able to bypass MFA 
through MFA fatigue or push bombing attacks. ITDR can help surface the 
risks associated with valid account attacks and help correlate information 
from HRIS to identity providers and critical applications to help mitigate  
low-hanging fruit credential attacks.

### Identity sprawl
Organizations are struggling with “identity sprawl,” which occurs when 
users have numerous accounts and identities managed by multiple systems 
that are not synchronized. This presents a continuous security risk and 
operational challenge for many security and IT teams.  

Identity sprawl is a growing challenge. Talos IR research noted that it was 
challenging to identify how the credentials were compromised considering 
they were obtained from devices outside the
