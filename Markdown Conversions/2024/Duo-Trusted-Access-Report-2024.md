In this report, we’ll delve into insights drawn from an 

analysis of over 16 billion authentications in the last 

year (and over 44B in the last 4 years), spanning nearly 

52 million different browsers, on 58 million endpoints 

and 21 million unique phones across regions including 

North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, 

and the Asia Pacific. We defined our 2023 annual time 

range as between June 1, 2022, and May 31, 2023\.

Key Findings

01

Stronger Auth Methods Show Upward Trends 
Authenticator apps like Duo mobile appeal to both demand for higher security and ease\-of\-use, 

with 91\.5% of accounts enabling Duo Push as a factor accounting for 21% or over 3\.2 billion 

authentications. We also observed a decreasing trend in SMS and phone calls as a factor, 

dipping to an all\-time\-low with 4\.9% of authentications—a 22% decrease from 2022\.

02

04

Return\-to\-Office is the New Hybrid Work Reality 
Last year, access to remote access applications fell to nearly 25% of authentications after 

peaking in 2020\. The quantity of authentications in this category has continued to decline 

since then as more companies move staff back into the office.

MFA Usage Continues to Expand Globally 
The number of MFA authentications using Duo rose by 41% in the past year, with countries like 

Germany seeing a 52\.3% increase in authentications year over year. In the Asia\-Pacific region, 

Japan, the Philippines, and Australia saw continued growth from last year, increasing by 28%, 

24\.9%, and 16\.9% respectively. Brazil makes the third\-highest increase in authentications 

seeing26\.3% more MFA usage from 2022\.

Diverse Device Environments Require Vendor\-Agnostic Security 
While Windows continues to lead the pack comprising 38\.2% of access devices, we note that 

iOS is a strong second at 33\.4% in the overall operating system ranking. Apple continues to rule 

the roost in the mobile category amongst Duo users, with the nearest contender being Android, 

which has a far lower adoption rate at 28\.2%. Eliminating potential security gaps, 

vendor\-agnostic security also allows for greater flexibility and scalability as the security 

system can easily adapt to changes in the device environment.

05

Organizations are putting in stricter controls reducing risk of out\-of\-date software 
The percentage of failures due to out\-of\-date devices increased by 74\.7% in 2023\. 

The more operating systems (OS) an organization allows to authenticate, the more likely it is 

those authentications will occur with an out\-of\-date OS. Organizations – particularly those 

which are expanding their IT environments – are increasingly putting in stricter controls, aiming 

to reduce risks posed by out\-of\-date software.

06

07

08

Failed Authentications Highlight User Risks 
5% of all measured authentications were ones that failed. When we further examined the data, 

we discovered that 28% of the failed authentications were due to the users not being enrolled in 

the system. Unenrolled users may gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or critical systems, 

leading to data breaches.

Top 3 Policy Groups to Reduce Security Debt 
One of the most effective strategies for mitigating security debt is through the comprehensive 

management of risk. Policies addressing geo\-restrictions, unsecure devices, and granular per\-

user or per\-application access can help reduce complexity and increase security coverage. 

However, 96\.4% of organizations have no policy related to location (allow, deny, or require 2FA).

Identity is The New Perimeter 
Without proper visibility, threat detection, and response, identity infrastructure provides ample 

opportunity for attackers to enter critical systems. In 23% of engagements observed by Talos 
IR, attackers were able to abuse compromised credentials to access valid accounts1\. The 
average company has 40\.26% of accounts with either no MFA or a weak MFA2\.

In an environment where sophisticated cyberattacks have become the norm, an 
access management solution needs to be enhanced with identity threat detection 
and response capabilities, offering visibility across an organization’s identity 
ecosystem in a single, comprehensive interface.

The weaknesses of passwords as a sole authentication method are well\-documented. They can 

be guessed, cracked, phished, or stolen, and users often exacerbate these vulnerabilities by 

reusing passwords across multiple services or creating simple, easily decipherable passwords. 

In contrast, multi\-factor authentication (MFA) mitigates these risks by introducing additional 

hurdles for potential attackers. Even if a password is compromised, the chances of an attacker 

also having access to the user’s physical device or biometric information are significantly lower.

However, recent high\-profile cyber\-attacks have shown that simply enabling a second factor 

does not make an account impenetrable. Not all authenticators are born equal, with factors like 

FIDO2 security keys and WebAuthn\-enabled biometrics proving harder to exploit compared to 

weaker, but more accessible, factors like SMS text or phone call.

Figure 05 Authentications for Remote Access Applications

Remote access applications are software apps that allow a user to remotely access and control 

another computer or network over the internet or a local network connection. These apps are 

used for various purposes including troubleshooting, file transfers, remote administration, or 

accessing files and software on an office computer from a remote location.

Last year, the number of authentications for remote access applications 

reached nearly 25%. This is lower than pre\-pandemic levels after the 

peak we saw in 2020\. The quantity of authentications in this category 

has continued to decline since then as more companies move staff back 

into the office. While we observe a lower volume of authentications across 

the board during the December and January holiday periods, several 

industries including education, retail, and healthcare spiked during the 

first calendar quarter.

10

With the return of business travel, designated in\-office policy, or even just flu season, 

predictable ebb and flow of authentication requests begin to fluctuate. The cadence breaks as 

employees take leave, work remotely, or operate on varied schedules. These changes can lead 

to a surge in remote access requests, with employees reaching out to corporate networks from 

a multitude of locations and devices, not just their usual work terminals. Consequently, the IT 

systems must handle an influx of mixed on\-premises and off\-site login attempts with a greater 

reliance on VPNs and other remote access technologies.

Moreover, seasonality can also bring about an increase in temporary staff as businesses scale 

up to meet demand. This influx requires the creation and management of additional temporary 

credentials, a wave of new entries into the authentication system. Once the season wanes, 

there’s a corresponding outflow as these seasonal credentials are revoked.

This variance does not merely alter the volume, but also the nature of authentications. There is 

a heightened need for robust security measures as the risk of cyber threats often spikes during 

these times. Thus, a layered security approach becomes even more crucial — with MFA as a 

minimum requirement. 

During these peak times, the IT environment’s authentication protocols must be both elastic 

and secure, expanding to accommodate the increased and varied load while maintaining the 

integrity of the system. IT staff remain on high alert to watch for any anomalous activity that 

could signify a breach attempt. 

11

The identity threat landscape is rapidly evolving, and trusted identity providers have fallen 

under attack. According to CISA, attackers are actively exploiting identity policy gaps to gain 

access to critical applications. Regardless of the increased risk, 85% of organizations feel 

they are not prepared and ready to protect themselves against modern attacks according to 
the Cisco Secure Readiness Index study3\.

Visibility across the identity infrastructure is a must\-have when addressing the types of attacks 

adversaries concoct. While there’s been a significant uptick amongst MFA authentications 

through Duo, another piece of research suggests that security gaps are still across the market: 
the average company has 40% of accounts with either no MFA or weak MFA4\. Especially 
in periods of change, strong access management and identity visibility is critical. For brief 

moments you might strike the right balance, only to be disrupted by new and emerging threats, 
changing user behavior, and a complex IT environment.

This is why modern security initiatives require continuous monitoring across identity, critical 

applications, and human resources information system (HRIS) versus a “set it and forget it” 

approach. As the security landscape evolves, many businesses are adopting a zero trust 

access policy strategy to mitigate modern attack surfaces. Organizations with a mature 

zero trust implementation score 30% higher in security resiliency than organizations without 
a zero trust strategy5\.

In 2023, we saw a proliferation of two specific types of MFA\-targeting attacks taking 

advantage of push\-based authentications and unassuming users:

01

02

Push harassment 

Multiple successive push notifications to bother a user into accepting a 

push for a fraudulent login attempt.

Push fatigue 

Constant MFA means users pay less attention to the details of their login, 

causing a user to mindlessly accept a push login request. 

Duo already supports WebAuthn FIDO2 authenticators, which offer the strongest protection 

against MFA\-based attacks. However, we know that rolling passwordless out across an 

organization is a journey. It’s encouraging to see that Duo Verified Push, a more flexible step\-up 

factor that became generally available to all Duo customers during the data period of this report, 

was enabled on over 5,600 accounts.

12

© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.As attackers’ techniques become more sophisticated, a multi\-layered defense system is crucial. 

Trust in users is essential, but no longer enough. The addition of outside 

vendors and contractors adds complexity to closed, managed endpoint\-only 
access policy. Duo Trusted Endpoints, made available to all Duo editions, adds 
an extra layer of security even if an organization cannot manage the device 

directly. Administrators can define a trust policy for every endpoint—whether 

managed or unmanaged, company\-issued, contractor\-owned, or personal—

and stop attacker’s unknown devices even if they are able to bypass MFA.

Increased friction often appears as a challenge to user adoption. As part of 
balancing security with productivity, we enhanced Duo Remembered Devices 
to account for changes in risk: when we recognize the device a user is on, 

we use a securely generated device token to authenticate so long as trust 

is maintained. 

While access security should be tailored to the level of risk, 

organizations can struggle to get buy\-in to add friction for every login. 
Duo’s Risk\-Based Authentication solution addresses this challenge—only 
stepping up to the more secure method when environment risk signals 

indicate there are potential threats, like location anomalies or known attack 
patterns. Whether security teams enable Verified Duo Push for all users, or 
through a risk\-based approach, this allows organizations to make access 

security decisions based on their risk appetite and organization’s needs.

IT teams must ensure that their Identity Security program is built on a strong 

foundation with the right tools, like strong MFA factors and intelligent step\-up. 
Once these tools and policies are in place, Identity Threat Detection and 
Response (ITDR) can bolster an organization’s identity security posture by 
arming the IT security professionals with both proactive and reactive tools.

ITDR helps proactively detect policy misconfigurations, identity\-provider\-to\-HRIS discrepancies, 

and excessive privileges. It can also catch high\-risk scenarios such as dormant or inactive 

accounts and accounts with MFA disabled—a trend noted in the 2023 Cisco Talos ‘Year in Review’ 
Report6\. On the reactive side, the tool equips IT teams to respond to suspicious activities such as 
new MFA device registration, risky SSO sessions, superman (unrealistic travel) logins, access from 

a new device or location and more.

02

The Continuing Rise in Global MFA Usage 

Data shows that the global customer base protected by Duo’s 

multi\-factor authentication security is continuing to grow. The number 

of MFA authentications using Duo rose by 41% in the past year, with 

countries like Germany seeing a 52\.3% increase in authentications year 

over year. In the Asia\-Pacific region, Japan, the Philippines, and Australia 

saw continued growth from last year, increasing by 28%, 24\.9%, and 16\.9% 

respectively. For the first year measured, Brazil makes the third highest 

increase in authentications seeing 26\.3% more MFA usage from 2022\.

This indicates a rising trend in the recognition of the importance of 

enhanced security measures predominantly as a response to a rising 

volume of cyber threats, but also as a reflection of international 

compliance requirements such as GDPR, C5, AgID, or HIPAA.

that we see users authenticate from when an organization is found in, say, Hong Kong. 

With continued diversification and spread of business interests, Hong Kong saw the highest 

average spread of authentication across 5\.6 different countries on average. Organizations 
in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom saw authentications come in from 

an average of 4 different countries — a 72% jump from the 1\.5 to 1\.75 different countries

parties can access the organization’s business’s digital infrastructure from various locations, 

often on different devices, networks, and operating systems which can introduce additional 

vulnerabilities. Data and resources can be accessed from a greater scale of networks and 

endpoints. This helps support the concept that ‘identity is the new perimeter’ and ‘context 

is the new MFA.’ Identity security is a forever evolving problem and it’s a daunting task for 

organizations to plug every hole the user journey creates.

In addition, an international presence does not only increase the variety in technology stack, but 

it can also add a wider array to the physical challenges of a more geographically diverse user 

base. Also, IT systems must cater to mixed tech stacks and varying data protection and privacy 

laws. This pushes the complexity that IT teams need to deal with yet another notch.

Globalization, like the organization size, increases the probability of a presence of more than 

one identity provider. Moreover, large organizations may acquire other companies, each of 

which may have its own existing identity provider. Instead of consolidating everything under 

one identity provider, which can be complex and disruptive, organizations sometimes choose to 

maintain multiple identity providers.

Managing identities increases in complexity with greater probabilities of supporting more 

than one identity provider (IdP). Without proper security measures in place, this can lead to 

potential security gaps or vulnerabilities that can be exploited for identity\-based attacks like 

compromised credentials. 

Global business practice requires broader, vendor\-agnostic access management 
that helps organizations detect, respond to, and report attacks.

16

© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.Identity is The New Perimeter 

Identity security is a key part of access management. Securing and verifying identities allows an 

identity and access management (IAM) system to manage access to resources effectively and 

securely. Because of this, it’s important to spend a few moments highlighting identity\-security 

trends that have come to light when we were pulling together this report.

There are a few reasons why gaps in identity security occur. For some companies, the prompt 

comes from cloud migration. As companies grow and move their operations to the cloud, 

they often need to introduce new IAM systems but do not completely deprecate older IAM 

systems. For other companies it is migration from an on\-premises directory to a cloud\-based 

directory but keeping both. And the third group is composed of companies that have acquired 

one or more companies and support numerous identity platforms.

Another contributing factor comes in the form of operational challenges. Identity security 

often falls under the IT function and may not receive the attention and resources it 

needs to be effective. It requires investment in technology and personnel to manage 

and continuously monitor the IAM systems, ensure compliance with regulations, and 

respond to security incidents.

For some, cloud migrations and organizational scaling require the introduction of new IAM 

systems. Mergers and acquisitions, operational globalization, and a geographically diverse user 

base add even more complexity to keeping track of authenticating identities.

In the face of digital transformation, identity security may suffer from a lack of resources or 

prioritization — typically bucketed as an IT function rather than a security one. Without proper 

visibility and threat detection, identity infrastructure provides ample opportunity for attackers 

to gain entry to critical systems. Identity has traditionally been managed by an organization’s IT 

teams. With identity being a top attack vector, it’s critical to bring together identity teams and 

the Security Operations Center (SOC) with ITDR so everyone is on the same page. 

Without proper visibility and threat 
detection, identity infrastructure provides 
ample opportunity for attackers to gain 
entry to critical systems

17

The Talos Perspective 

Cyber attackers are agile and often backed by substantial resources, 

including state sponsorship. This has led to an increase in advanced 

persistent threats which can target identities to gain access to 

sensitive information.

But this is nothing new. Attackers have targeted identities in their campaigns 

for many years. For example, on\-premises identity directories or VPNs that 

lack additional protections have fallen victim to several attacks. Managing 

an increased range of identities is also an indicator of expanded attack 

surface. Talos Incident Response (Talos IR) has repeatedly seen attackers 

targeting vendor and contractor accounts (VCAs), which typically have 

expanded privileges and access. VCAs are often overlooked during 

account audits due to trust placed in the third party, making them an 
easy target for attackers.

The Talos 2023 Year in Review report saw compromised credentials 

on valid accounts making up 23% of initial access vectors, with use of 

valid accounts as the second\-most common MITRE ATT\&CK technique 
observed7\. While one major vulnerability is improperly implemented MFA 
or lack thereof, in some engagements attackers were able to bypass MFA 

through MFA fatigue or push bombing attacks. ITDR can help surface the 

risks associated with valid account attacks and help correlate information 

from HRIS to identity providers and critical applications to help mitigate 

low\-hanging fruit credential attacks.

Identity sprawl

Organizations are struggling with “identity sprawl,” which occurs when 

users have numerous accounts and identities managed by multiple systems 

that are not synchronized. This presents a continuous security risk and 

operational challenge for many security and IT teams. 

Identity sprawl is a growing challenge. Talos IR research noted that it was 

challenging to identify how the credentials were compromised considering 

they were obtained from devices outside the company’s visibility, such as 

saved credentials on an employee’s personal device. One report shared 

that on average, companies have 340\.5 personal accounts (Gmail, Yahoo, 
Hotmail, iCloud, etc.) with access to company data8\. With the BYOD and 
perimeter\-less work culture, a growing quantity of employee identities goes 

unchecked or unmanaged.

Establishing Device Trust

Gaining visibility into and securing myriad devices is still an ongoing battle, especially for 

organizations and industries that see a large diversity of endpoints such as higher education. 

Strong authentication mechanisms are at the heart of the security protocol — an essential 

line of defense in confirming the identities of users accessing the network. However, robust 

authentication is just one piece of the cybersecurity puzzle.

Ensuring users are using trusted devices and networks to access corporate data adds 

another layer of complexity. IT environments with complex supply chain operations, third\-

party partnerships, and contractor devices introduce risk of outside, unmanaged devices and 

unknown endpoints. This variability makes it challenging, if not impossible, to guarantee visibility 

and trust without a dedicated layer of security. Even with strong end\-user authentication, the 

uncertainty of unmanaged network and device security remains a vulnerable chink in the armor.

In this context, identity\-centric security is a dynamic and multifaceted endeavor. It demands 

a strategy that is comprehensive and adaptive, integrating advanced authentication, network 

security solutions, endpoint protection, continuous monitoring, and an informed and 

conscientious workforce.

A Diverse Device Environment

The starting point for establishing device trust is gaining a comprehensive 

understanding of the devices themselves — their operating systems, the 

browsers they use, their patch levels, and their compliance with corporate 

security policies. This understanding is critical because the security 

posture of any device is heavily influenced by the currency and integrity 

of its OS and browser. Outdated software can be riddled with unpatched 

vulnerabilities that are ripe for exploitation, turning an unassuming device 

into a Trojan horse within the network.

To determine if a device can be considered trustworthy, IT and 
security teams must be able to answer several key questions: 

• Are there any unauthorized applications or software present?

• 

Is the device encrypted, and are its security settings 

configured according to the enterprise’s standards?

• What OS is the device running?

• 

Is this OS still supported and receiving security updates?

• What browser versions are installed, and are they set 

to update automatically?

Mobile and non\-traditional operating systems platforms show steady adoption, making up 

61\.8% of measured authentications. While we find that Windows is still the frontrunner, 

mixed IT environments can lead to more platform\-agnostic security considerations.

Maintaining device trust is a continuous process, requiring regular assessments and updates. 

This might involve automated compliance checks that verify whether a device is operating 

within the set parameters before granting access. Should a device fall short — say, running an 

OS version that’s no longer supported — it can be flagged for review, blocked from accessing 

sensitive resources, or provided with limited, controlled access to mitigate potential risks.

This is important as applications and browsers like Google Chrome up the frequency of patches, 

accounting for performance and security bug fixes on a weekly basis. But how often are 

people relaunching and updating their applications? Of the 16 billion authentications measured, 

62% of non\-mobile authentications are attributed to the Chrome browser. The ability to see 

access device patch levels and prompt users to self\-remediate out\-of\-date devices grows 

even more critical.

Visibility can be achieved through various tools and practices. Endpoint management systems, 

for instance, offer dashboards that provide real\-time insights into the status of every device 
connected to the network. Automated inventory tools can keep track of the devices in use, 

their software versions, and their patch history. This monitoring is essential not just for ongoing 

management but also for responding to potential security incidents with speed and precision.

Out\-of\-date failures 

The percentage of failures due to out\-of\-date devices increased by 74\.7% in 2023\. 

This is despite the fact that the percentage of organizations with policies governing 

out\-of\-date devices decreased by 6\.9%. The Asia\-Pacific region ranked highest, 

with 3\.8% of authentications occurring on an out\-of\-date browser.

The core of device trust lies in the ability to achieve complete visibility over the devices that 

are requesting access to corporate applications and data. In the ever\-evolving geography 

of digital threats, authenticating within an IT environment that relies on outdated software 

is akin to navigating a ship with an old map.

Outdated software often contains unpatched vulnerabilities, which are like hidden, 

open backdoors for cyber attackers. These vulnerabilities are well\-documented and 

easily exploitable as they stay in the public domain, providing a treasure map for malicious 

entities to gain unauthorized access. In this scenario, each authentication event is a gamble, 

increasing the chances that a security flaw can be used to compromise credentials.

Moreover, software that is past its support life no longer receives updates from its developers. 

This means that even as new threats emerge, the authentication mechanisms stay static and 

become increasingly ineffective against the sophisticated techniques employed by modern 
cyber adversaries. It is a static defense against a dynamic offense.

Figure 11 OS diversity and percentage of authentications that use an out\-of\-date operating system

OS (Shannon) Diversity

The horizontal axis represents how “diverse” (in the ecological sense) a set of OSes is 

used to authenticate within an organization. A higher number means a wider variety of OSes 

that share an equal proportion of authentications. On the vertical axis is the proportion of 

authentications made with out\-of\-date OSes. The line across the bottom shows organizations 

that enforce OSes to be up to date, and the vertical line on the left shows organizations that use 

only a single OS.

Based on the data in Figure 11, the correlation shows that the more operating systems an 

organization allows to authenticate, the more likely it is those authentications will occur with 

an out\-of\-date OS. This becomes a fast reality for those expanding IT environments

To rely on outdated authentication software is to walk on a tightrope without a safety net. It’s an 

open invitation to security breaches, data theft, and the many consequences that follow. For an 

IT environment to remain secure and effective, it is imperative to invest in current, robust device 

trust methods that evolve in lockstep with the landscape of digital threats, providing visibility 

and enabling remediation. This is not just best practice; it is a fundamental tenet of responsible 
IT management in the digital age.

Increase encryption 
usage

On Encryption \& Firewall… 

With the hybrid work model, organizations must also consider the use of virtual private 
networks (VPN), application of strict firewall policies, enforcement of data encryption, and 

secure setup of home networks. We looked at Duo Endpoint Health, particularly seeking to 

find out if organizations were generally increasing or decreasing their use of various protections. 

On an organization\-by\-organization basis, we see that, on average, organizations increased the 

percentage of encryption usage by 69%.

Device hygiene for the enterprise is an ongoing, evolving requirement, not a set\-it\-and\-forget\-it 

policy. This responsibility extends to the end\-of\-life process for devices, ensuring that all data 

is securely wiped and that devices are disposed of in a manner that does not pose a security 

threat. Similarly, user access levels must be adjusted to mitigate unnecessary or excessive 

privileges. Regular audits and compliance checks ensure that device and identity hygiene 

practices are not just in place but are effectively enforced and updated.

By diligently managing and monitoring operating system and browsers, among other device 

attributes, organizations can enforce a strong security posture and ensure that trust is not 

blindly given, but is based on verifiable, compliant device behavior.

26

04

In a previous section, we highlighted the critical challenge of security debt — an accumulation of 

unaddressed risks and vulnerabilities that an organization must manage. Security debt can arise 

from various sources such as outdated software, legacy systems, technical shortcuts, and the 

delayed application of security patches. Reducing this debt is essential for maintaining a robust 

security posture and minimizing the organization’s exposure to potential breaches.

One of the most effective strategies for mitigating security debt is through the comprehensive 

management of risk. This includes identifying, assessing, and prioritizing the vulnerabilities 

within an organization’s IT infrastructure. By understanding where the greatest risks lie, an 

organization can allocate resources and efforts more effectively to address the most pressing 

security concerns first, thereby reducing the overall security debt.

Learning From When Authentications Fail

When reviewing the policy data, we uncovered some notable findings. 

In a move towards stronger methods of authentication, Duo Push\-based 

69\.2%

authentication was present in 99\.3% of all global policies. Mobile one\-time 

of global policies included 

passcodes were in 91\.4% of policies defined. One of the more interesting 

WebAuthn, a promising 

findings was that WebAuthn was in 69\.2% of the global policies.

It is just as important, if not more so, to measure the authentications that 

failed. It was noted that 5% of all measured authentications were ones that 

failed. When we further examined the data, we discovered that 28% of the 

failed authentications were due to the users not being enrolled in the system.

28

© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.Benefits of Strong Device\-Based Policies

A cornerstone of this risk reduction strategy is the implementation of uniform security policies 

across all assets in the environment. Device\-based policies are especially critical because they 

provide a consistent security framework that applies to every device within the organization, 

irrespective of its location or user. These policies can control various aspects of device security, 

including the enforcement of strong authentication measures, the application of regular patches 

and updates, the configuration of firewalls and antivirus software, and the management of 

user privileges.

Uniform device\-based policies are beneficial for several reasons:

Consistency: They ensure that every device adheres to 
the same security standards, which helps to cut weak 

links in the security chain that attackers might exploit.

Scalability: As the organization grows, new devices 
can be brought into the fold with established policies 

automatically applied, making it easier to manage 

security at scale.

Compliance: Device\-based policies help organizations 
meet regulatory requirements by ensuring that all 

devices are compliant with industry standards and laws, 

reducing the risk of fines and other penalties.

Automation: These policies can often be enforced 
automatically, reducing the need for manual intervention 

and the associated human error.

Visibility and Control: Implementing uniform policies 
aids in the monitoring and control of device security, 

as deviations from the policy are easier to detect 

and remediate

While reducing security debt is a complex, multifaceted endeavor, the foundation of this effort 

lies in the consistent application of comprehensive device\-based policies. Such an approach 

addresses the security debt at its root, reducing risk and fostering a more secure, resilient 

organizational environment.

The interplay between access devices and security policies is a critical facet of an 

organization’s cybersecurity framework. Rigorous security policies are set in place to ensure 

that devices attempting to access corporate resources meet certain standards of security 

before they are granted entry into the network. When a device does not meet these prescribed 

criteria, it triggers a series of automated responses aimed at safeguarding the organization’s 

digital assets.

Duo’s data shows that organizations that implement device\-based policies most commonly 

block access from locations they consider unsecure and from where access should not 

originate. Organizations also tend to set policies to block invalid and out\-of\-date devices and 

those that don’t feature a screen lock or disk encryption, as those simple security steps can 

protect the device and the data it transmits from being viewed by others.

Here are 3 types of policies that can help reduce complexity and 
increase security coverage: 

01

Firstly, geo\-restrictions are a common security measure, especially in 
scenarios involving sensitive data regulated by legal or corporate policies 

dictating data residency and sovereignty. When a user attempts to access 

the system from a location that is not whitelisted, the security protocol 

promptly intervenes, resulting in a failed authentication. This geographical 

gating is an effective deterrent against a range of threats, including 

unauthorized access by international cybercriminals.

Based off our research, many organizations do not take the necessary 

step to implement geography\-based policies. In fact, we reported last year 

that the percentage of organizations who have any kind of policy denying 

specific geographic locations has dropped 20% since 2020\. In 2023, 

96\.4%

96\.4% of organizations have no policy related to location (allow, deny, 

of organizations have no 

or require 2FA). However, among those enterprises that do deny geographic 

policy related to location

locations, they block either Russia or China 91% of the time and 63% of 

those organizations block both countries.

Second, the use of invalid or outdated devices poses a significant risk. 
Devices that are no longer supported or have not been updated with the 

latest security patches are often riddled with vulnerabilities that can be 

exploited by cyber attackers. Security policies are designed to detect such 

devices based on their security posture — which includes the operating 

system version, installed security patches, and other critical security 

configurations. If a device is found wanting in any of these areas, the user 

may be barred from logging in or prompted to update their device to comply 

with the current security standards.

Third, granular access policies at the per\-user group or per\-application 
level lay the groundwork for least privileged access. Organizations today 
rely on their third\-party ecosystems to supplement and support critical 

business functions. Aside from regulatory requirements, having unknown 

guest, dormant, or orphaned accounts can create additional management 

overhead and be a vector for unauthorized access to sensitive resources. 

Organizations should implement policies and procedures for managing 

accounts and limiting what they can access. This can include enforcing 

strong multi\-factor authentication, regularly reviewing and auditing guest 

accounts, and disabling those that are no longer needed.

According to the State of Identity Security Report 2023, the average 

organization has many inactive accounts \- more than 24% of its total 

identities. These accounts experience more than 500 attacks every 

month. To add to user base complexity, more than 3\.24% of all 

identities are guest accounts.

The average organization 
sees over 500 attacks on 
inactive accounts each year

To ensure these policies are effective, organizations must also invest in employee education 

and awareness. After all, the most sophisticated policies can be undermined by human error. 

Organizations should educate their users about the potential risks associated with guest 

accounts and the importance of granting access only to trusted external users. Regular 

training sessions, simulations, and security drills can ingrain best practices and create a 

vigilant workforce capable of identifying and responding to security threats proactively.

Such stringent access controls, while occasionally inconvenient for users, are a necessary 
defense in an era where the sophistication of cyberattacks continues to escalate. They 

ensure that only compliant devices — and by extension, their users— can interact with the 

organization’s systems, thus preserving the integrity, confidentiality, and availability 

of corporate data and services.

Closing Words

The future of identity security

Identity sprawl foments vulnerabilities. However, traditional identity infrastructure was built 

with IT operations in mind instead of security. Although the worlds of identity and security are 

coming together, in many larger organizations, security teams continue to work independently 

of IAM teams. Talent shortage makes securing the organization even more challenging. 

For small and mid\-sized organizations, the IT department may just be a handful of people 

wearing lots of hats. A security team may not even exist yet. New security technologies 

such as identity threat detection and response can help bridge the gap between identity 

and security teams.

In addition to operational challenges, organizations battle with human capital constraints, 

namely the reliance on people to manage identities. Identity security is complex and requires 

an oversight of multiple elements, including:

User identity, which represents a specific user and 
is typically associated with unique credentials for 

authentication.

Device identity, which can be uniquely identified 
and associated with a user. The status and 

trustworthiness of a device can affect a user’s 

ability to access certain resources.

Attributes or properties of an identity, such as a user’s 
role, location, department, etc. Attributes can be used to 

determine and enforce access policies.

Permissions and access rights given to an identity, 
determining what resources that identity can access 

and what actions they can perform.

34

© 2024 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.When IAM hygiene is poor, organizations’ identity attack surfaces increase and provide 

additional opportunities to attackers. As more relationships are created between devices, 

attributes, identities and permissions, it becomes increasingly difficult to see and keep track 

of which identities are doing what.

Investigating incidents is also challenging without a solution that brings identity\-related data 

together from multiple sources or helps pass contextualized posture information from IT 

to SOC. Visibility into misconfigured and unused accounts, including employees, contractors, 

and service accounts is also vital.

Having identity threat detection and response capabilities under one roof with access 

management is becoming a necessity. In tandem, these capabilities can help minimize 

chances of successful identity\-based attacks while offering holistic coverage across 

identities and applications.

To address identity\-based attacks with greater efficacy, IAM analytics need to be an inherent 

part of such a solution. This way, IT administrators can quickly address any security gaps by 

migrating from weak authentication to strong, phishing\-resistant, multi\-factor passwordless 

deployments across a customer’s entire enterprise stack.

Context is the new MFA

In a world where data is king, but context is key, strong access management does not 

just continue to strengthen corporate security — it reshapes it. It addresses the inherent 

weaknesses of password\-dependent systems and establishes a more robust, dynamic defense 

against the ever\-evolving threat landscape.

Detailed logging and alerting mechanisms are essential to make sense of the noise. An attempt 

to authenticate via MFA can trigger alerts if the second or third factor fails, offering real\-time 

threat detection and allowing for immediate response. This can greatly reduce the “dwell time,” 

the interval between a breach and its detection, which is crucial in mitigating the damage 

inflicted by a security incident.

We know that when navigating uncharted complexities, the steps we need to take can be 

easy to understand but hard to implement. As cyber threats grow in complexity and subtlety, 

adopting IAM best practices stands as a necessary evolution of security protocols—integral 

to safeguarding the assets, reputation, and future of any modern organization.

35

• Organization\-wide adoption of strong MFA and moving towards requiring only 
phishing\-resistant MFA such as FIDO2 security keys for privileged accounts.

• Enable Verified Duo Push which disarms push harassment and push fatigue attacks and 

puts your organization on the path towards passwordless.

• Ensure only trusted devices, managed or unmanaged, are granted access to 

corporate resources.

• Set data\-informed user authentication policies that consider your organization’s risk levels 
and focus points, with intelligent factor step\-up that doesn’t impede user productivity.

• 

Leverage a modern single sign\-on solution as a policy enforcement tool to apply 
principles of zero trust and least privilege access for each application.

• Take advantage of solutions that assess user and device telemetry to identify known 
threat patterns and anomalies, like Duo Risk\-Based Authentication. Evaluate login 
attempts for context and risk.

• 

Identify the IAM complexities in your environment with ITDR and assess weak 
points based on how much visibility you have. Leverage Identity Threat Detection 
and Response capabilities to get visibility across your identity ecosystem in a single, 
comprehensive interface.
