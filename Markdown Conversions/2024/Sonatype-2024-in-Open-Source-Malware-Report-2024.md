2024 in Open Source Malware

The proliferation of open source malware, or malicious open source packages, continues to 
accelerate, posing unprecedented risks in the form of software supply chain attacks. Unlike vul\-
nerabilities, which are accidental coding errors, open source malware is intentionally crafted to 
infiltrate and exploit software supply chains. In fact, Sonatype estimates\* 50% of unprotected 
repositories already have cached open source malware.

In the 2024 State of the Software Supply Chain, Sonatype reported a staggering 156% year\-
over\-year increase in malicious packages identified over the past year. To date, Sonatype has 
identified 778,529 pieces of open source malware since it started tracking in 2019, an increase 
of over 70,000 since Sonatype’s annual report was published in October.

What is Open Source Malware?

While traditional malware often spreads through email attachments, malicious websites, or compromised devices, open 
source malware disguises itself as legitimate open source software (OSS) components to infiltrate the storage locations 
of code and other development assets. This unique distribution method — compromised open source repositories — 
exploits gaps in dependency management tooling and development build pipelines, bypassing conventional security 
mechanisms in order to attack software developers directly.

INTENTIONAL 
INSERTION
Open source malware is 
purposefully uploaded to 
open source repositories for 
malicious purposes.

TARGETING 
DEVELOPERS
It is designed to trick 
developers into running the 
malicious component during 
dependency install.

DIFFICULT 
TO DETECT
Today’s endpoint security 
tools do not detect these 
types of signatures.

Low barriers of entry to ecosystems

Open source malware thrives in ecosystems with low 
barriers to entry, no author identity verification, high con\-
sumption rates, and diverse user bases. As ecosystems 
like npm and PyPI process trillions of open source package 
requests annually, they create fertile ground for malicious 
actors seeking to infiltrate the software supply chain. 
Popular packages within these ecosystems are targeted, 
mimicked, modified, and repackaged to include mal\-
ware, sometimes through maintainer account takeovers. 
Attackers will often mimic legitimate package names and 
publish higher versions to trick build systems into installing 
malicious versions. These CI/CD pipelines then become 
unwitting consumers of malicious code when tainted com\-
ponents are introduced.

FIGURE 2
Open Source Malware by Format

The world’s largest registry for JavaScript packages, 
npm, exemplifies the risk contained in public repositories, 
representing 98\.5% of the malicious packages Sonatype 
has identified in the past year. Its open publishing 
model allows anyone to create and distribute packages, 
whether they are good\-faith contributors or malicious 
actors. This accessibility, combined with minimal vetting 
processes, makes npm particularly vulnerable.

• Ease of publishing: Developers can publish packages 
with minimal verification, enabling attackers to upload 
malicious components quickly and at scale.

• Spam and volume: In recent years, npm has faced 

surges of spam packages — some exploiting protocols 
like Tea.xyz to monetize downloads, others embedding 
malware for more insidious purposes.

• High demand: With over 4\.5 trillion requests expected 
in 2024 — a 70% year\-over\-year growth — npm’s scale 
makes it an attractive target for attackers seeking max\-
imum impact.

Beyond npm, other ecosystems like PyPI, which repre\-
sented just over 1% of the open source malware Sonatype 
observed, also face challenges from dependency confu\-
sion, typosquatting, and spam. PyPI’s rapid growth, driven 
by the rise of AI and cloud applications, has introduced 
complexities in managing both legitimate and malicious 
packages. As with npm, its open publishing model is a 
double\-edged sword: fostering innovation while increas\-
ing the attack surface for malicious actors.

2024 IN OPEN SOURCE MALWAREShadow downloads bypassing 
repository managers

There is a large number of malicious packages that are 
bypassing repository managers and are being down\-
loaded directly to a developer’s machine or shared build 
infrastructure. Shadow downloads are third\-party or 
open source components retrieved from a public repos\-
itory in a way that bypasses an artifact repository man\-
ager. This practice introduces unvetted and unobserv\-
able dependencies into projects, bypassing established 
governance, review, and security processes.

With millions of open source packages downloaded 
daily, a substantial portion bypass repository managers, 
which means open source malware has an easy way into 
development. While precise numbers vary by organiza\-
tion, recent insights indicate a surprising percentage in 
production environments originated from shadow down\-
loads, escaping security review entirely. 

The below chart looks at the known downloads retrieved 
from public repositories in a way that bypasses caching 
repository protections to enter software development. In 
November, the number of shadow downloads reached 
more than 63 billion, a 32\.8% increase over the same 
month of last year. Each of those components is bypass\-
ing security checks prior to application vulnerability scan\-
ning — this is important because malware is designed to 
trigger on download. 

FIGURE 3
Growth in Shadow Downloads

Shadow downloads undermine software supply chain 
security in several ways:

• Lack of visibility: Dependencies introduced via 

shadow downloads often go unnoticed, making it diffi\-
cult to manage updates.

• Increased malware risk: Direct downloads from public 
repositories expose systems to unvetted components, 
increasing the likelihood of introducing malicious 
packages, such as those associated with dependency 
confusion or typosquatting.

• Governance gaps: By bypassing repository managers, 
organizations lose the ability to enforce policies, such 
as release integrity checks or vulnerability scans.

Without centralized oversight, malicious components 
can and will evade traditional defenses and embed 
themselves into the software development lifecycle 
(SDLC), where traditional endpoint security products 
will not catch them and before application scanning will 
detect them. This represents a massive gap in enterprise 
security, and attackers can easily exploit gaps in gover\-
nance to deliver malicious payloads. By the time a shad\-
ow\-downloaded package is identified as malicious, it has 
already infiltrated the SDLC.

2024 IN OPEN SOURCE MALWAREOpen Source Malware in 2024

Open source malware manifests in various forms, each 
targeting specific vulnerabilities within software supply 
chains. The scale and creativity of open source malware 
attacks reveal the sophistication of modern threat actors.

In 2024, open source malware has increasingly targeted a 
wide range of industries (see Figure 4\). Government orga\-
nizations saw the highest number of attempted malware 
attacks, making up 67\.31% of the total malware attacks 
blocked by Sonatype this year. Other heavily impacted 
industries include financial services (24\.03%) and electricity, 
oil and gas (2\.15%).

Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUAs) represent 
the bulk of open source malware activity (see Figure 5\), 
nearly half of the total open source malware uncovered 
(64\.75%). This category includes components that incor\-
porate unintended functionalities, such as protestware or 
data collection. They pose significant risks by bypassing 
proper vetting processes and introducing unpredictability 
into software systems. While a PUA may not seem outright 
malicious, they could contain spyware, adware, or tracking 
components that would compromise the security and pri\-
vacy of end users.

Open Source Malware By Type

Security holdings packages (24\.21%) are components that 
have been flagged by ecosystem maintainers, often for 
malicious activity or to lock down End of Life (EOL) com\-
ponents, and replaced with a clean placeholder package to 
draw attention to consumers. Some repositories, including 
npm, do not disclose reasoning behind using security hold\-
ings packages. Although they cannot be consumed, if your 
organization has already pulled one, it should be removed.

Data exfiltration malware (7\.86%) is designed to harvest 
sensitive information from infected systems. Examples 
include extracting environment variables, personally identi\-
fiable information (PII), authentication tokens, and API keys, 
which are then sent to external servers for exploitation.

Code injection malware (.84%) contains harmful code 
that, if consumed, allows threat actors to execute unautho\-
rized commands or gain access to sensitive data within an 
application.

Open source malware designed to introduce backdoors 
(.78%) install hidden access points that allow attackers to 
wait for the opportune moment to exploit that will have the 
most impact. This is similar to the impacts of the software 
supply chain attack against SolarWinds’ Orion software, 
which allowed nation\-state actors access to federal agency 
networks.

Crypto stealers (.75%) extract cryptocurrency or hijack 
computational resources for unauthorized mining. While 
crypto stealers represent just a small portion of the malware 
Sonatype has observed, we saw with Lottie Player, for 
example, that just one piece of open source malware can 
lead to $723,000 in cryptocurrency lost to threat actors.

2024 IN OPEN SOURCE MALWARENotable Malicious Packages in 2024

APRIL 16

Tea.yaml 
Threat actors exploited the “Tea” protocol by flooding npm and PyPI with Potentially Unwanted 
Applications (PUAs). These malicious packages overwhelmed repositories, undermining trust 
and usability.

MAY 29

JUNE 3

JULY 26

Pytoileur 
A malicious package, pytoileur, was identified on PyPI concealing code that installed trojanized 
Windows binaries. These binaries enabled surveillance, established persistence on compro\-
mised systems, and facilitated cryptocurrency theft. 

LUMMA 
Threat actors leveraged the LUMMA malware using namespace confusion, packaging it as 
open source packages targeting developer environments.

Travis.yml 
Researchers uncovered malware embedded in a travis.yml attempting to be passed off as a 
sample CI/CD build configuration file. The malware deployed a malicious macOS binary dis\-
guised as “Safari updates,” leveraging trusted build systems to distribute its payload.

AUGUST 7

Solana\-Py 
The solana\-py package on PyPI exemplified a sophisticated typosquatting attack. Borrowing 
code from the legitimate project, this malicious package covertly extracted user secrets, mak\-
ing it an effective tool for targeted credential theft. 

OCTOBER 31

Lottie Player 
The JavaScript library Lottie Player was compromised. Attackers released three malicious ver\-
sions, leading to significant financial losses, including one reported phishing incident resulting 
in over $723,000 stolen from a user.

2024 IN OPEN SOURCE MALWAREStrengthen Defenses Against Open Source Malware

The rise of open source malware represents a fundamental challenge to the integrity of modern software development. 
As dependency chains grow increasingly complex and repositories process trillions of requests annually, the threat land\-
scape will continue to evolve. 

Predictions for 2025 suggest a sharp escalation in AI\-driven open source malware attacks, proliferation of crypto\-stealers, 
and an expanding focus on unmaintained open source projects. The attempted XZ Utils takeover and backdoor discovered 
earlier this year is, in all likelihood, just the tip of the iceberg with additional sophisticated campaigns awaiting discovery. The 
value of open source as an attack vector has been realized, so there is an urgent need to increase protections. 

Improving ecosystem governance 

Ensuring proper governance of dependencies at the ecosystem level is an important step to reducing exposure to harm\-
ful components. Ecosystem managers can do this by requiring packages be digitally signed with cryptographic signatures 
that verify the packages’ authenticity and source.

Implementing vetting processes for contributors that requires a thorough onboarding process can help reduce the risk of 
malicious submissions. On an ongoing basis, dependency monitoring is crucial to ensure compromised components are 
identified and removed, ultimately reducing exposure for downstream users. 

Stopping open source malware before development

The key to mitigating the threat of open source malware lies in blocking it before it enters the development environment. 
Allowing malicious components to infiltrate build pipelines dramatically increases the difficulty of detection and removal. 
By this stage, malware is already embedded in the SDLC, often bypassing traditional security measures.

To counter this, organizations must block malicious packages before they enter the repository and eliminate shadow 
downloads — the use of unauthorized or unvetted components outside the scope of managed repositories.
