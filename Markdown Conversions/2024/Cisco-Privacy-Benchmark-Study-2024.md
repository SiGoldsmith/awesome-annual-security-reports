## Introduction
Over the past few years, privacy has evolved from relative obscurity to being a 
business imperative, a regulatory mandate, and a customer requirement. During this 
time, Cisco’s Privacy Research has explored the value of privacy investment and its 
economic benefits for organizations who have learned to better inventory, manage, and 
protect data. Customers who were once resigned to accept the lack of transparency 
from organizations now demand that their data be used only in transparent, legal, and 
appropriate ways, including in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. As such, privacy 
has become a critical element and enabler of customer trust.

## Methodology
This report, Cisco’s seventh annual 
review of privacy perspectives for 
organizations, explores current privacy 
trends, challenges, and opportunities. It 
draws upon data gathered in summer 
2023 from an anonymous survey in which 
the respondents did not know who was 
conducting the study and respondents 
were similarly unknown to the researchers. 
The survey respondents included 2,600 
security and privacy professionals in 
12 countries (5 Europe, 4 Asia, and 3 
Americas)[^1]. They were asked about their 
organizations’ privacy practices and 
spending, reactions to privacy legislation, 
AI, and data localization requirements. The 
findings from this research demonstrate 
the continuing importance of privacy to 
businesses and how they serve their 
customers.

Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom, and 
United States.

## Key findings
1. Privacy has become a critical element and
enabler of customer trust, with 94% of
organizations saying their customers would not
buy from them if they did not protect
data properly.
2.  
Organizations strongly support privacy
laws around the world, with 80% indicating
legislation has had a positive impact on them.
3.  
The economics of privacy remain attractive, with
95% saying benefits exceed costs and the
average organization realizing a 1.6x return on
their privacy investment.
4.  
There has been relatively slow progress on
building customer confidence with respect to
AI; 91% of organizations still recognize they
need to do more to reassure their customers.
5.  
Organizations are already getting significant
value from generative AI applications, but
they’re also concerned about the risks to their
intellectual property or that the data entered
could be shared with competitors or the public.
6. Organizations believe that global providers,
operating at scale, can better protect their data
compared to local providers.

## Results

### 1. Privacy as a critical enabler of customer trust
Customers increasingly want to buy from organizations they can trust with their data. Ninety-
four percent of organizations in our survey said their customers would not buy from them if 
they did not adequately protect customer data. What’s more, customers are looking for hard 
evidence that organizations can be trusted when it comes to privacy. Ninety-eight percent 
of respondents said that external privacy certifications, such as ISO 27701, Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross-Border Privacy Rules, and European Union (EU) Binding 
Corporate Rules, are important in their buying process. Organizations know these issues are 
important to customer trust, and nearly all organizations (97%) feel they have a responsibility 
to use data ethically. As indicated below, all of these percentages are at their highest levels 
from the surveys of the past three years. See Figure 1.

Organizations are also increasingly recognizing the connection between privacy investment 
and business benefits, especially in building brand trust and loyalty. For a number of years, 
we have asked respondents about the business benefits they are realizing from their privacy 
investment, including reducing sales delays, mitigating losses from data breaches, enabling 
innovation, achieving operational efficiency, building customer trust, and making their company 
generally more attractive. This year, over 70% indicated they were getting “significant” or “very 
significant” benefits from each of these six areas. Note that “Loyalty and Trust” received the 
highest percentage of responses (80%) and is up from 71% and 75% the past two years.  
See Figure 2.

For privacy-mature organizations (i.e., those that consider their privacy programs to be ahead of 
their peers), the percentage getting benefits from “Loyalty and Trust” is even higher. Ninety-two 
percent of the most privacy-mature organizations indicated they are getting significant benefits 
in this area, compared with 71% of those that are the least mature. See Figure 3.

Translating privacy objectives to organizational activities can be difficult. One way for 
organizations to implement them is through the use of privacy metrics, especially when those 
metrics are reported to executive management and the Board of Directors. Among this year’s 
respondents, nearly all (98%) are reporting one or more privacy metrics to the Board, and 
over half are reporting three or more. Many of the top privacy metrics tie very closely to issues 
of customer trust, including audit results (44%), data breaches (43%), data subject requests 
(31%), and incident response (29%). See Figure 4.

### 2. Strong support for privacy laws globally
While governments, organizations, and individuals all have roles to play in protecting personal 
data, 50% of the Cisco 2023 Consumer Privacy Survey respondents indicated they wanted 
governments to take the lead. Sixty-six percent of respondents also said privacy laws had a 
positive impact, compared to only 4% who said they have had a negative impact.  
For this year’s Benchmark Study, we asked organizations a similar question, and they were 
even more supportive of privacy laws than the consumers. Eighty percent of all corporate 
respondents said privacy laws have had a positive impact on their organizations, with 14% 
neutral, and only 6% indicating the laws have had a negative impact. This is despite the 
significant effort and cost involved in privacy compliance, for example, cataloging data, 
implementing controls, and responding to user requests. Note that this sentiment was quite 
consistent across regions, with 78% in Asia, 80% in Europe, and 83% in the Americas indicating 
the privacy laws have been positive. By country, the highest average percentages were in China 
(91%), India (88%), Germany (86%), and the U.S. (86%). Even though the U.S. does not yet 
have a federal omnibus privacy law, U.S. companies are still subject to sectoral laws, state and 
local laws, and the laws in the countries in which they operate. See Figure 5.

Many governments and organizations are putting in place data localization requirements to 
ensure that certain data is kept within a specific country or region. Among organizations, most 
(91%) believe that their data would be inherently safer if it is only stored within their country 
or region. But almost the same number (86%) also said that a global provider, operating at 
scale, can better protect their data compared to a local provider. These responses indicate that 
organizations would ideally like to keep their data local, but they still prefer and trust a global 
provider over a local provider. See Figure 6.

Interestingly, this preference for global providers held true by geography. The percentage saying 
“a global provider can better protect data compared to a local provider” was 78% or higher in all 
12 geographies of survey respondents. See Figure 7.

### 3. Privacy economics remain attractive
Privacy continued to provide attractive economic returns for organizations around the world in 
2023. Ninety-six percent of respondents agreed that privacy is a business imperative, not just  
a compliance burden, and 95% indicated that privacy’s benefits are greater than its costs.  
See Figure 8.

In our research, we’ve been tracking privacy spending, estimated financial benefits, and return 
on investment for organizations over the past five years. During this time, spending has more 
than doubled, benefits have trended up, and returns have remained strong. For 2023, average 
spending overall was similar to 2021 and 2022 at $2.7 million. Average spending rose at the 
largest organizations (10,000+ employees) to $3.9 million from $3.6 million last year. At large 
organizations (1,000 to 9,999 employees), spending rose to $3.1 million from $2.8 million. 
Smaller organizations saw lower spending, including those with 50-249 employees, decreasing 
from $2.0 million to $1.5 million this year. See Figure 9.

Estimated financial benefits remain higher than when we started tracking it four years ago, with 
an average estimated benefit in 2023 of $2.9 million. This is lower than last year’s peak of $3.4 
million, with similar reductions in large and small organizations. The causes of this are unclear, 
since most of the other financial-oriented metrics, such as respondents saying privacy benefits 
exceed costs, respondents getting significant financial benefits from privacy investment, and ROI 
(return on investment) calculations, all point to more positive economics. We will continue to track 
this in future research to identify if this is an aberration or a longer-term trend. See Figure 10.

Comparing spending and benefits together, privacy remains a very attractive financial investment 
for most organizations. The average organization reports getting privacy benefits of 1.6 times 
their investment. In addition, 30% of organizations estimate returns at least two times with some 
(12%) realizing returns upwards of three times their investment. See Figure 11.

### 4. Slow progress on transparency and AI readiness
According to the Cisco 2023 Consumer Privacy Survey, 62% of consumers are concerned 
about how organizations apply and use AI, and 60% already have lost trust in organizations 
over their AI practices. We asked organizations about this in last year’s Data Privacy Benchmark 
Study, and 92% of respondents said their organizations needed to do more to reassure 
customers that their data was only being used for intended and legitimate purposes when it 
comes to AI. When we asked the same question in this year’s survey, the percentage had  
only dropped to 91%, indicating not much progress has been made during the past year.  
See Figure 12.

Cisco 2024 Data Privacy Benchmark Study |  15 
 
One challenge facing organizations when it comes to building trust with data is that their 
priorities may differ somewhat from their customers. Consumers identified their top priorities 
as getting clear information on exactly how their data is being used (37%), and not having 
their data sold for marketing purposes (24%). When asked the same question, organizations 
identified their top priorities as complying with privacy laws (25%) and avoiding data breaches 
(23%). While these are all important objectives, it does suggest additional attention on 
transparency would be helpful to customers — especially with AI applications where it may be 
difficult to understand how the AI algorithms make their decisions. See Figure 13.

In the Cisco 2023 Consumer Privacy Survey, we asked respondents what actions organizations 
could take to reassure their customers about data use and AI. Over 70% of them said that 
auditing the AI applications for bias, improving transparency, ensuring a human was involved 
in the process, and instituting an AI ethics management program would make them more 
comfortable. When we asked the same question to organizations in this privacy benchmark, 
their top responses were explaining how the AI application works (50%), ensuring a human 
is involved in the process (50%), instituting an AI ethics management program (49%), and 
auditing the application for bias (33%). These differences in responses between the two survey 
audiences suggest there is more to be done in this space. See Figure 14.

Of course, even with the best of intentions, it often takes time to put in place the necessary 
elements for AI applications. The Cisco AI Readiness Index, published in fall 2023, evaluated 
more than 8,000 organizations and assessed their readiness across six domains: strategy, 
infrastructure, data, governance, talent, and culture. The analysis showed that only 14% of 
organizations worldwide believed they were fully ready to integrate AI into their businesses.  
Organizations interested in benchmarking themselves should review that publication and its 
associated online materials. See Figure 15.

### 5. Data concerns with GenAI
Generative AI (GenAI) applications have the power to use AI and machine learning to create 
new content based on user prompts, including text, sound, music, images, video, and code. 
Like many new technologies, AI brings opportunities as well as challenges for how best to 
manage and control it. While the majority (52%) of consumers in the Cisco 2023 Consumer 
Privacy Survey indicated they were unfamiliar with GenAI, most organizations have now become 
very familiar (55%) or somewhat familiar (41%) with it. Most are already deploying it in their 
organizations, as 79% of respondents said they are getting significant or very significant value 
from GenAI today. See Figure 16.

Generative AI puts AI capabilities in the hands of many more users, and 92% of organizations 
said they see it as a fundamentally different technology with novel challenges and concerns 
requiring new techniques to manage data and risk. Among the top concerns cited were that the 
use of GenAI could hurt the organization’s legal and intellectual property rights (69%), the 
information entered could be shared publicly or with competitors (68%), and that the 
information it returns to the user could be wrong (68%). See Figure 17.

Nonetheless, many GenAI users are entering information that could be problematic if it were 
to be shared externally. Sixty-two percent of respondents said they have entered information 
about internal processes, 48% have entered non-public information about the company, and 
45% have entered employee names or information. See Figure 18.

Most organizations have become aware of these risks, with many working to put in place 
controls that would limit their exposure. Sixty-three percent have established limitations on 
what data can be entered, 61% have limits on which GenAI tools can be used by employees, 
and 27% have banned GenAI applications altogether, at least for the time being. Almost all 
organizations reported having at least one of these controls in place. As this technology is still 
evolving rapidly, we expect the type and nature of the controls to also evolve as organizations 
seek to harness the power of GenAI without risking unauthorized sharing of confidential or 
personal information. We will continue to follow this matter in future research. See Figure 19.

## Conclusion and recommendations for organizations
This research highlights many of the essential aspects of privacy for organizations today. 
Privacy has become a critical element and enabler for building and maintaining customer trust. 
It also represents an attractive economic investment and provides important ground rules as 
organizations prepare for expanded use of AI and GenAI. Governments, organizations, and 
individuals must continue to play their respective roles, ensuring that personal data is protected 
and used only when legal and appropriate. The findings in this research point to these specific 
recommendations for organizations:
1.  
Provide greater transparency in how your organization applies, manages, and uses personal 
data as this will go a long way towards building and maintaining customer trust.
2.	
Establish protections, such as AI ethics management programs, involving humans in the 
process, and working to remove any biases in the algorithms when using AI for automated 
decision-making involving customer data.
3.	
Apply appropriate control mechanisms and educate employees regarding the risks 
associated with GenAI applications.
4.	
Consider the costs and consequences of data localization and recognize that local providers 
may be more expensive and degrade the functionality, privacy, and security of your data 
when compared to global providers operating at scale.
5.	
Continue to invest in privacy to realize the significant business and economic benefits for 
your organization.

## Meeting our customers’ standard of trust
Organizations have always required security to protect assets, help manage risk, and build 
customer confidence and loyalty. Today’s complex business environment, novel technological 
innovation, and customer expectations have privacy emerging as another critical element of 
customer trust. As customers set their standards of trust, Cisco continues to listen, learn, and 
evolve to meet those standards, prioritizing trustworthiness, transparency, and accountability 
throughout our holistic approach. 
In addition to the annual Privacy Benchmark and Consumer reports, Cisco also publishes 
Privacy Data Sheets and Privacy Data Maps for its major products and services, enabling 
anyone interested to understand what personal data is used, who has access to it, and how 
long it is retained. Our Responsible AI Principles and Framework show how these principles 
and practices form our broad AI governance framework. And the Cisco Purpose Report and 
ESG Reporting Hub offer relevant resources related to how we prioritize trustworthiness, 
transparency, and accountability in our environmental
