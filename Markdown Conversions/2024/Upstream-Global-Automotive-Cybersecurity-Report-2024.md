It is my pleasure to present you with the 2024 Global Automotive Cybersecurity Report.
Connectivity and software\-defined architectures have been at the forefront of monumental 
changes in the Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem over the past several years, but as more 
functionality is being exposed, cybersecurity risks ‌
are growing dramatically.
This report, which marks Upstream’s sixth annual report, analyzes how Automotive and Mobility 
cybersecurity risks have evolved from experimental hacks to large\-scale attacks, shifting the 
industry's focus to impact.
As predicted last year, automotive cybersecurity is reaching an inflection point. Cyber incidents have 
grown significantly in risk and impact, threatening safety and carrying operational implications. With 
threat actor motivation shifting towards large\-scale impact on mobility assets, stakeholders across 
the ecosystem must also evaluate the potential financial implications of cybersecurity incidents.
Over the last year, the Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem adopted new standards and 
collaborated with regulators around the world on how to adapt future regulations to keep connected 
and software\-defined assets secure. We’ve also been busy preparing for the upcoming second 
milestone of UNECE WP
.29 R155, scheduled to take effect in July 2024, increasing its scope to all 
new vehicles.
2023 was the year of the GenAI revolution. GenAI is increasingly used by threat actors to introduce 
scale and new attack methods. But, in the coming months and years GenAI will also transform 
automotive cybersecurity tools and workflows and introduce unprecedented efficiencies to vSOC 
teams.
This inflection point illustrates the progress that adversaries continue to make, and reaffirms 
our commitment as an industry to continually innovate and deliver secure automotive and smart 
mobility experiences.
Upstream has led the effort to secure connected vehicles and mobility assets since 2017, when we 
first introduced the Upstream Platform, which proved to be a fundamental, innovative pillar in the 
automotive cybersecurity technology stack.
We've been helping some of the world's leading Automotive and Smart Mobility organizations—
OEMs, suppliers, mobility IoT vendors, fleets and mobility service providers—comply with 
cybersecurity regulations and protect millions of vehicles and mobility assets. 
With advanced cybersecurity tools and knowledge at our disposal, we are well\-equipped to 
overcome the challenges in 2024 and ahead.
Best regards,
Yoav Levy
Co\-Founder \& CEO

METHODOLOGY
The Automotive industry relies on Upstream's continuously updated database of 
cybersecurity incidents.
To compile this comprehensive report, Upstream researchers investigated over 
1468 incidents, some as early as 2010, and monitored hundreds of deep and dark 
web forums to compile this comprehensive, actionable report that will help you safely 
navigate the year ahead. 
Upstream monitors and analyzes worldwide automotive cyber incidents to learn, 
understand, and help protect the entire Smart Mobility ecosystem from existing and 
emerging threats.
Upstream’s AutoThreat®1 cyber threat intelligence platform uses advanced technology 
and automation tools to constantly search all layers of the web for new cyber incidents 
in the automotive ecosystem and index them to the AutoThreat® platform. 
Our researchers and analysts carefully categorize and analyze the data we collect to 
gain a deeper understanding of cyber threats, adversaries' motivation and activities, 
and their impact on mobility assets.
Each incident and relevant contextual data—such as the attack's geolocation, impact, 
attack vector, company type, and required proximity of the attacker to its target—are 
added to the platform to create an accurate and actionable repository. 
Incidents examined in this report were sourced from the media, academic research, 
bug bounty programs, verified social media accounts of government law enforcement 
agencies worldwide, the Common Vulnerabilities \& Exposures database, as well as 
other publicly\-available online sources. 
In addition to publicly reported cyber incidents, Upstream’s analysts monitor the deep 
and dark web for threat actors that operate behind the scenes of automotive\-focused 
cyber attacks. These incidents are discussed in a separate chapter of this report titled 
"Threats from the Deep and Dark Web", and are excluded from statistics and charts in 
other chapters, unless indicated otherwise.
While every effort has been made to identify and analyze every reported automotive 
and smart mobility cyber incident, there may be additional attacks that have not been 
publicly reported, and therefore, have not been included in this report.
Select details of the publicly reported incidents are available in the AutoThreat® 
Intelligence Cyber Incident Repository. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis is 
available to AutoThreat® PRO2 customers.

2023 MARKS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW 
ERA IN AUTOMOTIVE CYBERSECURITY
Connectivity has been at the forefront of monumental changes in the 
Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem over the past several years—
enabling over\-the\-air (OTA) updates, software\-oriented architectures, advanced 
digital experience, and a wide array of value\-added applications and services.
In modern software\-defined vehicles (SDVs), connectivity is used to improve 
and upgrade vehicles throughout their life cycle, generate revenue from a wide 
range of feature\-on\-demand services, and offer innovative data\-driven customer 
experience, ultimately creating deeper and longer relationships with customers.
In connected vehicles, OEMs use OTA updates to fix quality and usability 
issues, tune core functional capabilities, and patch cybersecurity vulnerabilities 
quickly and cost\-effectively, reducing warranty costs and recalls.
But connectivity has also posed growing cybersecurity challenges for OEMs 
and their supply chains—with cyber attacks becoming more sophisticated, 
frequent, and severe. As the attack landscape changed over the last few years, 
and new attack methods emerged, the industry became acutely aware that any 
point of connectivity can be attacked.
The first decade of automotive cybersecurity was marked by a rise in cyber 
incidents and attacks against OEMs and the ecosystem, continuously 
introducing new attack vectors and methods, even as OEMs invested in 
improving cybersecurity protections. According to Upstream’s research, between 
2019\-2023, incidents disclosed in the clear web (media) have increased by over 
50%, reaching 295 reported incidents in 2023\. In 2023 alone, 95% of attacks 
were remote, and 64% of attacks were executed by black hat actors.3 
Application programming interfaces (APIs) have been playing a key role in 
exposing vehicle functionality to drivers and enterprise applications, as well as 
delivering a data\-driven experience. As more functionality has been exposed 
through APIs, cybersecurity risks have also increased dramatically, while at 
the same time, the cost of attacking and attack thresholds have decreased—
opening the door for exponential growth in the scale and impact of attacks.
In this year’s report, we chose to zoom 
in on the impact of automotive and 
mobility cybersecurity risks.

We’ll focus on both external impact, which is visible to the ecosystem, and 
internal impact which refers to organizational efficiencies and processes. 
Both internal and external impacts are assessed by different stakeholders in 
different ways—in this report we’ll offer a framework which can be customized for 
each stakeholder’s strategic goals, target market, relevant mobility assets, etc.
External impact can be objectively 
measured in two dimensions: 
scale and cost. 
We’ll showcase how advanced connectivity and software\-defined architectures 
continuously introduce new cybersecurity risks, attracting executives' attention 
across the entire ecosystem due to the potential impact on the safety of 
drivers, passengers and the integrity of data at massive scale, leading to 
astounding financial losses. 
With social media becoming a major platform for consumers and professionals, 
threat actors are using social media to exchange knowledge with the potential 
to reach millions of people around the world in a matter of minutes. Based 
on its viral potential, social media has become one of the top distribution 
channels for malicious activities, both criminal and fraudulent, and should be 
considered when analyzing external impact and scale. 
As vehicles continue to evolve well after they leave the manufacturing 
floor based on continuous over\-the\-air updates (OTAs), we’ll also discuss 
the internal impact of cybersecurity risks on internal processes and risk 
evaluations that drive automotive stakeholders to adopt new frameworks and 
remediation processes.

Analyzing the potential scale of automotive cyber risks
Automotive cybersecurity threats have evolved rapidly in a very short span 
of time. In 2015, Charlie Miller spent three years—from research to exploit—
to hack the safety\-critical in\-vehicle network of a single vehicle.4 In 2023, 
a team of security researchers spent a mere few months hacking over a 
dozen different car makers. The team hacked telematic systems, automotive 
APIs, and the infrastructure that supports them. They discovered numerous 
vulnerabilities that allowed them to remotely impact the command \& control 
of vehicles and access sensitive OEM and consumer data.5
In 2023, automotive cybersecurity 
witnessed a dramatic shift 
toward large\-scale incidents.

It’s important to note that when analyzing scale, the focus is on potential 
impact. It is impossible to assess the exact impact of each incident based on 
publicly reported information. 
Upstream analyzed publicly disclosed automotive cybersecurity incidents 
between 2021 and 2023 according to the potential scale of impacted mobility 
assets, including vehicles, users, mobility devices and more. Upstream’s 
analysis categorized incidents according to four levels of impact—starting 
from “Low”, which includes incidents that have the potential to impact under 
10 assets, up to “Massive”, which includes incidents that have the potential to 
impact millions of mobility assets.

During both 2021 and 2022, “High” or “Massive” (potential to impact thousands\-
million of mobility assets) incidents accounted for approximately 20% of total 
incidents. But, in 2023, the proportion of incidents with a “High” or “Massive” 
impact dramatically doubled to nearly 50%.
Overall, the number of "Medium" scale attacks, which have the potential to 
impact up to 1,000 vehicles and mobility assets, has remained constant over 
the last three years. But the number of low\-scale attacks has gone down 
dramatically in 2023 due to the emergence of new attack vectors that enable 
hackers to gain control over many more vehicles and assets with lower 
thresholds of knowledge and resources. 
To illustrate the operational disruption impact of cyber attacks on mobility 
service providers consider an attack which occurred in September 2023\. 
A leading US\-based trucking and fleet management solutions provider 
experienced a ransomware attack that resulted in customers being unable to 
electronically log their on\-road hours—as required by federal regulations—or 
track their transported inventory.6
In response, the company hired external cybersecurity experts to investigate 
the attack and applied for a waiver from the US Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration to allow truckers to use paper logs until ‌
service was restored.7 
Almost three weeks passed before the 
company was able to resolve the issue, 
causing serious operational disruption for 
thousands of truck drivers, fleet operators, 
and inventory management teams.

THREAT ACTORS MOTIVATION 
HAS ALSO SHIFTED TOWARDS 
SCALE AND MASSIVE IMPACT
In addition to incidents disclosed in the media (clear web), 
it’s critical to assess the impact of deep and dark cyber 
activities and the incentives driving threat actors. Based 
on Upstream’s analysis of deep and dark web automotive 
cybersecurity activities, analyzing the 300 most active threat 
actors, nearly half of the activities (48%) were targeting 
more than one OEM or automotive supplier, and 37% 
had the potential to impact mobility assets across many 
stakeholders on a global scale.
In 2023, nearly 65% of deep and 
dark web cyber activities had the 
potential to impact thousands to 
millions of mobility assets.

When zooming in on black hat and fraud activities 
in the deep and dark web, the potential scale and 
areas of interest also indicate a rapidly growing 
risk. Currently, 67% of malicious activities (threat 
actors categorized as black hats and fraud 
operators) have a “High” or “Massive” impact 
(compared to 45% across all actors) and 58% of 
activities involve multiple OEMs or have a global 
reach (compared to 48% across all threat actors). 
When analyzing the 
areas of interest, the 
impact of black hats 
and fraud operators 
continues to deepen.
13% of activities are focused on vehicle

THE RISING COST OF CYBER ATTACKS ON THE 
AUTOMOTIVE AND SMART MOBILITY ECOSYSTEM 
Automotive and Smart Mobility cyber attacks have severe financial 
repercussions leading to recalls or OTAs, production shutdowns, ransomware 
payments, and vehicle thefts. Additional repercussions include data and 
privacy breaches, which can damage a brand's reputation and customer trust 
and can eventually lead to large regulatory fines and diminishing revenue. 
Given the shift toward large\-scale cybersecurity incidents—with nearly 50% 
of incidents in 2023 impacting thousands\-millions of mobility assets9—it’s 
crucial for vehicle security operations center (vSOC) teams to analyze the 
financial impact of these incidents.
In June 2023, a leading Taiwan\-based semiconductor manufacturer 
disclosed a cybersecurity incident involving a ransomware group and one of 
its IT hardware suppliers, which ‌
led to the leakage of information pertinent to 
initial setup and configuration of the system.10 The attackers claimed to gain 
access to internal documents with confidential information, demanding a $70 
million ransom to decrypt the data and prevent its release online—making it 
the largest known ransom demand in history. While the breach could affect 
multiple automotive stakeholders, the company reported that neither its 
business operations nor customer information were affected by the cyber 
incident at its supplier. The company also immediately terminated its data 
exchange with this supplier following the incident.
In November 2023, a large Australian automotive group with 12 dealerships 
and hundreds of employees was attacked by the same ransomware group, 
who stole more than 50 GB of sensitive customer and internal data. Over 
91,000 files were stolen, including payroll information, lease agreements, 
payout information, service quotes, invoices, crash assistance forms, CRM 
data, registration paperwork, and employee driver and motor vehicle sales 
licenses. The stolen files were published at the end of November, after the 
ransom deadline had expired.11

Analyzing the financial impact of a cybersecurity incident
Trying to quantify the safety, privacy, and financial risks of automotive 
cybersecurity incidents is no small feat. The potential impact of automotive 
cyber threats is significant and can pose risks to the safety of drivers and 
passengers, disrupt business operations, compromise data privacy, and 
result in financial losses for OEMs as well as the entire supply chain. 
In the next two illustrations we will analyze two incidents that occurred in 2023 
and suggest a financial impact model, based on publicly available information. 
The goal of this framework is to 
highlight the massive financial 
impact of cybersecurity risks. 
This analysis doesn’t intend to be definitive, but rather a framework for 
estimating a range of potential financial risks.

Financial impact of an EV fleet\-wide vulnerability 
In March 2023, a team of French security researchers participating in a hacking contest demonstrated 
an exploit that involved executing what is known as a time\-of\-check\-to\-time\-of\-use (TOCTTOU) attack 
on an EV OEM’s gateway energy management system that allowed them to remotely perform actions 
(e.g., open the front trunk or door) while the car was in motion.12
Despite the OEM's claims that this was not possible, the researchers claimed they could have 
remotely gained access to vehicle controls. The researchers were rewarded by the OEM with an EV 
and $100,000 in cash, and reported that the OEM is working on making software patches for the 
vulnerability and the updates should be pushed to cars soon.

Financial impact of an EV charging network data breach
In June 2023, a security researcher discovered an online database containing millions 
of logs (nearly a terabyte) of a global network of hundreds of thousands of electric 
vehicle charging stations.14
The internal database, hosted on one of the most popular public cloud platforms, 
required no password to access it and contained sensitive data of customers who used 
the EV charging network. Data contained names, email addresses, phone numbers of 
fleet customers, names of fleet operators with vehicles that recharge using the network, 
and vehicle identification numbers (VINs), and locations of EV public and private 
(e.g., residential) charging points.

OEMS TAKE A MULTIFACETED APPROACH TO 
PROTECTING CONNECTED AND SOFTWARE\-
DEFINED VEHICLES, AS WELL AS IOT/OT ASSETS
In this era of high\-impact cyber risks, OEMs have had to adopt new internal 
frameworks, shifting to a multifaceted approach to protecting connected and 
software\-defined vehicles. Connected vehicle digital experience and data\-
driven features are made possible by connected components, remote control, 
and the APIs that support them. Continuous OTA updates enable OEMs to roll 
out new features and functionality, and patch bugs. The result is the emergence 
of the dynamic Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). As the SBOM continuously 
changes, it constantly requires risk and vulnerability analysis, directly impacting 
OEM and the supply chain cybersecurity frameworks and processes.
The internal impact: the dynamic SBOM 
The convergence of technologies known collectively as ACES—Autonomous 
Driving, Connectivity, Electrification, and Shared Mobility—has forced 
stakeholders to move from the traditional hardware\-defined architecture to a 
software\-oriented architecture.
The Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem acknowledges that connected 
and software\-defined vehicles are the key to competitiveness, customer 
experience, operational efficiencies and future data\-driven revenue streams. 
New research released by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with 
Boston Consulting Group (BCG) estimates that the emergence of SDVs will 
create over $650 billion in value for the auto industry by 2030, making up 
15% to 20% of automotive value. OEM revenues from automotive software 
and electronics will grow nearly three\-fold between now and 2030, from $87 
billion to $248 billion, according to a BCG analysis of SDV growth.19
While connectivity and SDVs present significant benefits, they also presents 
growing cybersecurity challenges for OEMs and the entire supply chain.
The distinction between ‌
hardware and software product development has 
become blurred, as more in\-vehicle components are enabled and managed by 
software\-oriented architectures. The decoupling of the vehicle development 
process from a vehicle’s hardware and software integration creates a very 
complex and decentralized supply chain with the OEM at the center of 
system integration.
OEM REVENUES

SOFTWARE AND 
ELECTRONICS WILL 
GROW NEARLY 
THREE\-FOLD 
BETWEEN NOW AND 
2030, FROM $87 
BILLION TO $248

TO A BCG ANALYSIS 
OF SDV GROWTH.
22

The Hardware Bill of Materials (HBOM) is a product development technical 
document that details the hardware components used to build a vehicle—
such as ECUs, TCUs, infotainment systems, gauge clusters, CAN bus, and IoT 
controllers—each from different suppliers and supply chains with their own 
software and software supply chains. 
The SBOM is a dynamic software development technical document that details 
the software components, libraries, and dependencies that are installed on a 
hardware component and the vehicle‌
. Together, the HBOM and SBOM provide 
a comprehensive view of the supply chains, facilitating transparency and 
traceability to address hardware and software vulnerabilities. 
With frequent OTA updates, the SBOM is no longer static—but rather 
constantly evolving long after a vehicle leaves the factory—and risk profiles 
continuously change, but they can be remediated in real time as well. 
Furthermore, modern SDV HBOMs and SBOMs go beyond in\-vehicle 
components to include charging points and networks, as well as 3rd\-party 
applications for smart mobility, OEM services, telematics devices, and electric 
vehicle (EV) charging—adding even more complexity.
Recent regulatory efforts, including UNECE WP.29 R15520 and R15621, ISO/
SAE 2143422, the US National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA) 
guidelines23, and recent regulations in China24, have mandated SBOM 
adoption in the Automotive industry. These regulations broaden the scope 
of SBOM to encompass not only OEM\-developed software, but also Tier\-1 
and Tier\-2 components and libraries—giving OEMs the ability to identify and 
manage software\-related vulnerabilities and risks.
The ability to manipulate software components and exploit vulnerabilities 
poses a significant threat to the cybersecurity posture of fleet\-wide control 
systems. By exploiting SBOM\-related vulnerabilities, attackers can gain 
unauthorized access to critical functions and control mechanisms across 
entire fleets of vehicles. 
Furthermore, the vast amounts of data generated by software components, 
and stored in backend systems, presents an additional risk. Backend systems 
(e.g., telematics servers) play a crucial role in delivering advanced connected 
vehicle functions and services, as well as collecting and managing huge 
amounts of sensitive data related to vehicle state, location, usage patterns, 
and driver behavior. 
Attackers can tap into this data, which contains PII of millions of automotive 
users, without even needing to hack the actual vehicles themselves. The 
threat of cyber attacks on backend servers is particularly high because of 
the ability of malicious threat actors to impact entire fleets, both in terms of 
control and data access. 
23
© 2024 Upstream Security Ltd. All Rights Reserved
The growing reliance on these backend 
systems highlights the urgent need for 
OEMs to safeguard both the software 
components and the sensitive data stored 
in their backend systems.
An ever\-changing SBOM makes it extremely challenging to manage Threat 
Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) for modern vehicles. As a part of the 
organization’s broad Risk Management efforts, TARA is a specific framework 
which has been developed as an in\-depth yet static process. But, TARA is 
rapidly evolving into a dynamic framework. The impact of this mindset shift is 
dramatic, as stakeholders must adopt new tooling and platforms, and ensure 
teams are properly trained. 
The internal impact expands with the need to add deep and dark web 
analysis into TARA frameworks. By integrating deep and dark web monitoring 
and real\-time threat intelligence into the SBOM framework, OEMs can:
Automotive threat intelligence is now a key element in product\-driven TARA, 
enabling proactive risk identification, prioritization, and mitigation. 
A dynamic TARA framework with real\-time threat intelligence based on an 
expanded SBOM framework is essential for OEM software development 
teams to enable long\-term risk mitigation. 
Proactively identify 
and address 
vulnerabilities 
in software and 
hardware components.
Continuously assess 
and manage supply 
chain risks to ensure 
integrity and security of 
components used 
in vehicles.
Rapidly detect 
cybersecurity risks 
and attacks, and provide 
effective response 
and mitigation.

Furthermore, the vSOC adds another important layer for effective TARA, 
integrating real\-life detected risks into the continuous TARA feedback 
loop. This requires adopting an interactive framework for both TARA, threat 
intelligence and vSOC analysts that will cooperate to ensure TARA is not 
only performed dynamically but also effectively. 
OEMs should also link SBOM vulnerabilities, based on the dynamic 
TARA analysis, to enterprise security, orchestration, automation, and 
response (SOAR) platforms to ensure cross\-organizational visibility, timely 
remediation, and long\-term risk mitigation via focused R\&D efforts.

External APIs pose a prime attack vector for massive\-scale attacks
APIs are the engine that supports automotive digital transformation, and play 
a crucial role in securing connected vehicles. 
Cybersecurity risks increase as 
more apps are added to support 
connected vehicle experiences 
and enable data\-driven features.
Connected vehicles and smart mobility services rely on diverse APIs, 
resulting in billions of transactions every month. Everything from OEM mobile 
companion apps, third party apps, infotainment systems, internal OEM and 
Tier\-1 management systems, dealership systems, after\-market mobility IoT 
devices, to EV charging management and billing apps rely heavily on APIs to 
achieve core functionalities. 
APIs also present significant and fleet\-wide attack vectors and are 
susceptible to a wide range of cyber attacks, such as the theft of sensitive or 
personal identifiable information (PII), or malicious remote vehicle control. 
In March 2023, a security researcher disclosed gaining access to a 
Japanese OEM’s CRM database. The attacker modified the dev app to use 
the production API, which was unintentionally exposed through the loading 
spinner settings. This incident was a direct result of misconfigured APIs and 
a lack of proper authentication and verification. As a result, the researcher 
could access names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, tax IDs, 
and vehicle / service / ownership history of the OEM’s customers.25

Social Media Has Become 
A Breeding Ground For 
Automotive Cyber Activities
Thanks to social media, auto 
enthusiasts and hackers can now 
easily share their automotive hacking 
discoveries with a global audience. 
The impact of social media on cybersecurity cannot be overstated. With its 
massive reach and influence, social media has become a breeding ground for 
cyber activities, often blurring the lines between pop culture and malicious 
intent. What was once hidden in the depths of the deep and dark web is now 
easily exposed and accessible to a wide audience.
27

In recent years, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram have become 
popular platforms for sharing automotive hacking tools and manuals, 
jailbreaks, and hacking demos \- moving discussions on how to hack vehicles 
from the depths of the deep and dark web to the open internet.
Some automotive hacking discoveries are created and shared by 
cybersecurity experts and white hat hackers with the intent to raise 
awareness and encourage addressing risks. Other automotive hacking ploys 
are created and shared over social media with malicious intent. 
Regardless of initial intent, information shared on social media may 
encourage additional threat actors, offering easy access to tools and 
jailbreaks. 
The viral nature of social media amplifies the speed and reach of exploits, 
leading to reputational damage, financial losses, and operational disruption 
—making it crucial for OEMs to stay vigilant and adopt robust cybersecurity 
strategies to mitigate the risks posed by this new frontier of cyber threats.
A prime example of this is the so\-called “TikTok Challenge” which went viral in 
October 2022, leading to the nationwide theft of tens of thousands of vehicles 
manufactured by one Korean OEM. 
A year earlier, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, saw a significant increase in car thefts, 
mainly from one Korean OEM, with many of the suspected thieves being 
too young to drive. On social media, videos emerged showing young people 
joyriding in these cars—speeding and swerving, sometimes hanging out of 
windows. The aim of these thieves wasn’t to strip and sell parts from cars, but 
rather to gain social media clout and views.27 As videos showing how to steal 
the vehicles spread, thefts of the Korean OEM spiked across the country the 
following year.28 
In January 2023, it was reported that two of America’s largest auto insurers 
refused to write policies in certain cities for the affected vehicles as they were 
found to be easy to steal.29
In a February 2023 press release, NHTSA called out TikTok by name, stating 
that “a TikTok social media challenge has spread nationwide and has resulted 
in at least 14 reported crashes and eight fatalities,”30 and advised consumers 
that the Korean OEM offered a free dealer\-installed anti\-theft software update 
that attempted to reduce the risk in over 8\.3 million US vehicles.31 
In May 2023, the Korean OEM also agreed to pay up to $200 million to settle 
one class\-action lawsuit, but it still faces lawsuits from insurers and cities, 
with‌
 more to follow, as thefts of the affected vehicles continue to rise.

Jailbreaking infotainment systems is also trending on social media. In 
September 2023, unauthorized firmware updates and custom software 
impacting various infotainment systems of EVs from multiple OEMs were 
offered for sale on Facebook by a high\-profile automotive threat actor. 
The threat actor has a large Facebook community with 44,000 followers, 
indicating significant exposure of the products sold, and is also highly active 
on other social media platforms, such as Youtube, where he publishes services 
and tutorials on how to conduct unofficial USB firmware updates.
In November 2023, a jailbreak that allowed unauthorized content to be 
installed within the head units of various OEMs was published on a popular 
Russian automotive social networking site, describing all the steps required 
for implementing the jailbreak and adding unauthorized apps to the head 
unit—including files for download. 
As jailbreaks spread on social media platforms, the potential negative 
effects on vehicle cybersecurity posture, safety, consumer trust, and 
the Automotive industry's reputation increase.
Jailbreak incidents can have multiple consequences:
Jailbreaking infotainment head units can lead to stability and 
performance issues resulting in system failures, or compatibility 
problems with other features. 
Unauthorized vehicle software modification can introduce cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities, opening the door to hacking, which could result in theft, 
data breaches, or unauthorized control of the vehicle.
Unofficial firmware updates may erode the value of official firmware 
updates provided by affected OEMs, making it harder to encourage 
customers to adopt official, tested firmware updates. 
Modifying the vehicle’s firmware without authorization 
could void the warranty.

Advanced vehicle hacking tools such as keyless repeaters, jammers, and OBD 
devices are also widely promoted on social media.
In May 2023, a relay attack keyless repeater promising the ability to unlock and 
start vehicles manufactured between 2008\-2023 from multiple OEMs was offered 
for sale on TikTok by a threat actor promoting a Polish automotive cybersecurity 
and hacking ecommerce website offering a wide selection of vehicle\-hacking 
tools.32 Relay attack keyless repeaters make it possible for malicious actors to 
gain unauthorized access to a vehicle and steal it without the physical key fob.
Vehicle hacking tools are gaining widespread attention on social media 
platforms, resulting in immediate and severe consequences to an already 
massive spike in keyless vehicle theft incidents, increasing public fear and 
posing greater challenges for law enforcement.

THE AUTOMOTIVE AND SMART MOBILITY 
ECOSYSTEM IS ENTERING A NEW ERA OF 
GENERATIVE AI, DEMOCRATIZING ATTACKS 
BUT ALSO CYBER DEFENSE 
The era of Generative AI (GenAI) is well underway in the Automotive industry, 
as OEMs rush to adopt GenAI capabilities to enhance customer experience 
and unleash the next wave of productivity. In 2023, a global OEM launched 
a ChatGPT\-powered voice assistant to 900,000 beta testers using a private 
and secure instance of Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service that does not share 
back data with OpenAI or the ChatGPT model.34
The GenAI revolution will have a profound impact on both 
automotive cybersecurity stakeholders and threat actors
GenAI is expected to become a critical tool for threat actors, enabling them 
to effectively perform large\-scale attacks and reduce barriers to entry. By 
utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), threat actors can quickly identify 
vulnerabilities and learn how to exploit them, standardizing their tactics, 
methods, and processes. 
APIs are specifically susceptible since 
attackers can use GenAI to explore API 
documentation, which may be publicly 
available, accidentally self\-disclosed, 
or leaked on the dark web.
GenAI can be used to map endpoints, target APIs, and identify potential 
vulnerabilities, as well as provide step\-by\-step guidance on exploiting 
those vulnerabilities. LLMs can also be used to generate malicious code or 
scripts by assimilating information from public vulnerability databases and 
cybersecurity research.
32

Threat actors can use GenAI as a tool 
to carry out and automate complex 
phishing attacks, generate convincing 
fake content (social engineering), 
and create malware that can adapt 
and evade detection systems. 
The adaptability and efficiency allow for the execution of large\-scale attacks 
that may bypass traditional cybersecurity measures. 
LLMs trained on cybersecurity threat intelligence data can be used to escalate 
offensive strategies and execute sophisticated attacks with automated 
processes and significant scale. By analyzing vulnerabilities and attack 
patterns, they can generate strains of malware that self\-evolve, creating 
variations to attack a specific target with a unique technique, payload, and 
polymorphic code that’s undetectable by existing security measures.
For example, threat actors can use LLMs to automate the discovery of 
vulnerabilities, increasing efficiency and allowing them to shift resources 
to exploiting vulnerabilities rather than identifying them. GenAI also allows 
attackers to rapidly sift through vast amounts of data, identifying the most 
vulnerable targets. This approach not only speeds up the attack process but 
also increases its effectiveness, as AI models can pinpoint weaknesses that 
might be overlooked by human analysis.
Additionally, GenAI can simulate various attack scenarios, helping attackers 
refine their strategies and improve their tactics. By using GenAI to simulate 
attack environments, cybersecurity faces an additional challenge, as it leads 
to more unpredictable and sophisticated attacks, increasing the difficulty of 
detecting these attacks.
According to research by Bain \& Company, mentions of GenAI on the dark 
web proliferated in 2023, increasing by several orders of magnitude.35

Automotive cybersecurity leaders must embrace GenAI's 
transformative capabilities
On the defensive‌
, GenAI has the potential to transform automotive 
cybersecurity solutions and operations, enabling a range of use cases—from 
agile investigations, to automating vSOC workflows, and even generating 
complex insights based on deep and dark web data and in\-depth TARA.
GenAI introduces unparalleled efficiencies, enabling cybersecurity teams to 
quickly analyze massive amounts of connected vehicle and mobility data 
across multiple sources, detect patterns, filter incident alerts, and automate 
investigations.
According to a recent report by Gartner, 
by 2026, more than 80% of enterprises will 
be using generative AI APIs and models 
and/or will be deploying GenAI\-enabled 
applications in production environments, 
up from less than 5% in 2023\.36
In 2023, Upstream launched its own GenAI\-enabled application (alpha 
release) that helps automotive stakeholders transform the vSOC through 
improved investigations, automation, data insights, and detailed analytics. 
With today’s vSOC absorbing massive amounts of data from multiple 
sources, GenAI helps draw insights by querying the data with simple NLP 
questions. Upstream's GenAI\-powered solution continuously monitors trends, 
providing context and analysis of impact.

White Hat
In contrast, white hat hackers, 
often researchers without 
malicious intent, who try to 
penetrate and manipulate systems 
to validate security or assess 
vulnerabilities. White hat hackers 
constantly find new and disturbing 
vulnerabilities. They operate 
independently, through companies 
leveraging their services, or as part 
of a bug bounty program, where 
they are rewarded for responsibly 
disclosing the vulnerabilities.
Black Hat
Black hat hackers attack systems 
for personal gain, financial 
gain, or for malicious purposes. 
Today's black hat hackers are no 
longer lone malware developers. 
They are part of well\-organized 
and well\-resourced operations, 
which employ thousands of 
cybercriminals worldwide, 
capable of coordinated 
simultaneous attacks against 
multiple companies.
Most attacks in 2023 — 64% of incidents — were carried out by black hat actors

As technologies and cybersecurity measures advance, hackers have also evolved, 
and stakeholders must gain deep visibility into who is carrying out attacks.
Hackers are classified as black hats, white hats, or gray hats depending on their 
intentions, actions, and malicious intent:
Gray Hat
Gray hat hackers are a subset of 
the general white hat attackers 
group, and present a dynamic 
landscape in which the lines blur 
between ethical and malicious 
activities. These hackers 
contribute both to discovering 
vulnerabilities and, in some 
cases, exploiting them. Gray 
hat hackers exhibit a spectrum 
of motivations, running from 
responsible disclosure to less 
altruistic motives such as financial 
reward or recognition. Also, their 
activities often raise ethical and 
legal questions regarding their 
work without explicit authorization.

There is a major difference between automotive black hat attacks and IT 
black hat attacks, regarding the consequences and impact of their actions. 
Automotive black hat attacks—which are closely aligned with cyber attacks 
on critical OT infrastructure, such as health, energy, and governmental 
facilities—result in not only disruption of services and financial losses, but 
also potential for safety hazards and loss of lives. 
In September 2023, a leading US\-based trucking and fleet management 
solutions provider experienced a ransomware attack that resulted in 
customers being unable to electronically log their on\-road hours—as required 
by federal regulations—or track their transported inventory.69 In response, the 
company hired external cybersecurity experts to investigate and applied for 
a waiver from the US Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to allow 
truckers to use paper logs until ‌
service was restored.70
In June 2023, a Korean OEM's in\-vehicle infotainment system was hacked after 
it issued a security update.71 In a previous attack, the same hacker gained root 
access to the Linux\-based system via the engineering menu and firmware 
image manipulation—enabling him to run custom applications. The OEM 
responded by releasing a new firmware image and removing the old firmware 
images. The OEM engineers also used a private key to sign firmware images, 
but didn't ensure the updater always verified the signature, which allowed the 
attacker to gain root access and install unsigned code—again.72
In December 2023, researchers reported that a fleet management software 
vendor ignored a dangerous telematics gateway vulnerability that had been 
reported in April 2023\. This vulnerability poses a significant risk, since 
hackers may be able to target the backend infrastructure to manipulate and 
shut down entire fleets—impacting tens of thousands of vehicles. It is unclear 
to what extent these gateways were used, but the vendor is tracking over 
119,000 vehicles in over 49 countries. There have been no known exploits of 
the vulnerability.73
In response to OEMs' growing use of in\-vehicle subscriptions for 
connected services and software\-enabled features, gray hat hackers are 
constantly looking for ways to bypass security measures to install their 
own applications or gain free access to paid services. Moreover, the 
vulnerabilities they expose, and often discuss in forums on the deep and 
dark web, can be exploited by black hat actors.

NEARLY ALL ATTACKS CONTINUE 
TO BE EXECUTED REMOTELY
Most automotive cyber attacks can be divided into two main categories: 
remote attacks—which can be short\-range (e.g., man\-in\-the middle attack) 
or long\-range (e.g., API\-based attack)—and physical attacks, which require a 
physical connection to the vehicle (e.g., OBD port). 
Remote attacks rely on network 
connectivity (e.g., Wi\-Fi, Bluetooth, 
3/4/5G networks), and have the 
potential to impact numerous 
vehicles simultaneously. 
Remote attacks have consistently outnumbered physical attacks since 2010, 
and they continue to grow—accounting for 89% of all attacks between 2010 
and 2023, and 95% in 2023\. The vast majority of remote attacks in 2023 
were long\-range attacks (85%). The percentage of long\-range attacks has 
increased, rising from 70% in 2022, as a result of the adoption of connectivity 
and software\-defined architectures.

ATTACKS ARE BECOMING MORE IMPACTFUL
The Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem is increasingly impacted by 
cyber attacks. Attacks on vehicles often compromise sensitive data, but can 
also have far\-reaching consequences, including safety hazards, business 
disruption, vehicle theft, system manipulation, and fraud.
Operational service and business disruption is continuously on the rise, 
accounting for 42% of incidents, up from 40% in 2022\. We have also 
witnessed a dramatic increase in fraud\-related incidents, accounting for 20% 
of 2023 incidents and up from 4% in 2022\.
Service / 
Business disruption
Disruption to normal business operations, such as delays or halts 
in production, caused by a cyber attack (e.g. OEM or Tier\-1 supplier 
ransomware attack, operational fleet disruption caused by a cyber attack 
on systems or devices).
Data / 
Privacy breach
A data breach occurs when a threat actor gains unauthorized access 
to proprietary, confidential data, such as intellectual property (IP), trade 
secrets, financial information, or personally identifiable information (PII). 
Cybersecurity incidents involving data breaches are the most common 
and most expensive.
Fraud
Illegal use of vehicle data and/or vehicle consumer data by threat actors 
for financial gain.
Vehicle theft
Vehicle thefts involving long\-range, short\-range, and physical attacks by 
threat actors.
Car system 
manipulation
Threat actor activities targeted at tampering with various in\-vehicle 
systems, changing their expected operational behavior and potentially 
creating safety risks.
Policy violation
Threat actors' actions that violate established rules, regulations, 
or policies regarding the use, operation, or management of vehicles.
Location tracking
Illegal use of GPS navigation data to track a vehicle's location
and movement without user or owner consent.
Control of 
vehicle systems
Threat actors can take full or partial control of a vehicle from long 
distances by overriding its systems through connected components.

CVES MUST BE CLOSELY MONITORED 
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) was designed to provide 
an open and standardized method for rating CVEs. ‌
CVSS helps organizations 
prioritize and coordinate joint responses based on the vulnerability’s base, 
temporal, and environmental properties.74 Vulnerabilities are also graded 
from Critical, High, Medium to Low, or None, based on their CVSS score.75
In our analysis of CVEs, we focus only on CVEs that directly affect the 
Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem (OEMs, Tiers\-1s, shared mobility, 
mobility IoT devices, fleets, etc.). We exclude from this analysis CVEs that 
relate to generic IT hardware or open\-source software components that may 
be used across the supply chain. 
The Automotive industry has recorded 725 specific CVEs since 2019; 378 
CVEs were published in 2023, compared with 151 in 2022\.
The 150% increase in CVEs in 2023 can be attributed to the continued 
proliferation of connected components and the growing awareness of 
stakeholders to proactively identify vulnerabilities.
Security teams, developers, and researchers use CVSS together with several 
other methods to assess risks. CVSS scores have practical applications across 
the product's supply chain, such as determining whether vulnerabilities have 
already been exploited and prioritizing patching efforts, and allocating time and 
resources more efficiently. CVSS is also used by ISO/SAE 21434 as part of the 
standard’s risk assessment process to determine attack feasibility.
CVEs should also be closely monitored by fleet managers and operators. 
In addition to affecting risk assessments across the fleet, CVEs can also be 
considered when strategically designing the fleet composition.

OVERVIEW OF 2023 CVES
CVEs are acknowledged and cataloged cybersecurity risks that can be 
quickly referenced across the Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem. It is 
common to find these threats on OEM products, but they can also appear in 
the products of OEM supply chain companies.
OEMs assemble vehicles from hundreds of software and hardware modules 
produced by Tier\-1 and Tier\-2 suppliers. Each component’s quality and safety 
rests with the company that produces it. Consequently, each company involved 
in the supply chain has the responsibility to oversee and ensure the quality 
and safety of each automotive\-related product. Because vulnerabilities are 
not always addressed on time, or even at all, a single flaw in a commonly used 
software module or component can impact millions of vehicles.
Although CVEs disclose critical vulnerabilities, they can also be exploited by 
hackers.

witnessed a rise in severity. In 2023, critical and high vulnerabilities accounted 
for nearly 80% of total CVES, up from 71% in 2022\. This trend amplifies the 
importance of closely monitoring automotive\-specific CVEs by all stakeholders 
and proactively detecting exploits, as well as prioritizing mitigation.

THE IMPACT IS FELT ACROSS THE
SMART MOBILITY ECOSYSTEM 
A growing number of sectors that have expanded 
their digital footprints, such as EV charging, fleet 
management, and mobility sharing applications, face 
not only ransomware attacks but also attacks targeting 
infrastructure and public safety.
Cyber attacks threaten every segment of the 
Automotive, Smart Mobility, and Mobility\-as\-a\-Service 
(MaaS) ecosystem.

OEMS AND SUPPLIERS SHARE RESPONSIBILITY 
Besides costly recalls, brand damage, and loss of data, cyber attacks against 
OEMs and their component suppliers have led to production shutdowns. 
In June 2023, a US\-based Tier\-1 supplier of high\-performance alloys for 
the Automotive industry began experiencing a network outage indicative 
of a cybersecurity incident.76 For the next 11 days, many aspects of the 
company’s production were substantially disrupted—including administrative, 
sales, financial, and customer service functions. The company reported that 
the lost production time impacted net revenues by roughly $18\-20 million, 
and diluted earnings per share by approximately $0\.40\-$0\.45\.77
As OEMs rely heavily on suppliers, the risk of cyber attacks is compounded. A 
hacker can exploit a vulnerability in a Tier\-1 or 2 component supplier to gain 
direct access to the vehicle itself. 
In August 2023, a Dutch Tier\-1 supplier of electromagnets was hit by a 
ransomware attack in which the ransomware group gained unauthorized 
access to the company's business systems, disrupting its development and 
sales departments. The ransomware group is known for deploying models 
such as double\-extortion, initial access broker affiliates, and advertising 
on hacker forums. In response, the company hired leading third\-party 
cybersecurity experts and activated its response protocol, including its 
business continuity plan.78
The EV charging ecosystem is rapidly expanding 
Concerns over grid cybersecurity and charging infrastructure 
increase as the number of EVs grows. The fast adoption 
of EVs has resulted in the relatively rapid development and 
deployment of charging infrastructure—often overlooking cybersecurity best 
practices and vulnerabilities. 
Chargers are vulnerable to physical and remote manipulation that can 
manipulate their functionality, and expose EV users to fraud, data breaches, 
and even ransom attacks. There are also emerging threats associated with 
various charging attack vectors, including vehicle\-to\-charging network, grid\-
to\-vehicle, and grid\-to\-fleet.
In January 2023, a security researcher exploited a popular screen sharing 
program to gain access to the underlying Operating System (OS) of a new 
350\-kW charger from a US EV charging company. The researcher could access 
the OS menu, open the web browser, and navigate to a competitor's website 
47
© 2024 Upstream Security Ltd. All Rights Reserved
while the charger app remained running in the background.79 An earlier incident 
occurred in which another hacker gained access to the charger's critical 
settings and could view functions such as overheat protection.80
In July 2023, security researchers published a detailed report highlighting 
three critical vulnerabilities found in the API interfaces of a Charging Station 
Management System (CSMS) of a Switzerland\-based provider, allowing 
adversaries to access files uploaded by other users, bypass the required 
provisioning PIN code (authentication), and hijack a charger's OCPP 
connection.81 The researchers demonstrated attack vectors that expose 
drivers’ data and impact service availability of the vendor’s provisioning 
process, management, and operations of charging stations.82
In May 2023, security researchers reported a vulnerability, known as CVE\-
2023\-29857,83 in a popular 3rd\-party application used by owners of US EV 
OEM. The vulnerability allows attackers to obtain sensitive information via 
directly accessing the application link.84
Commercial fleets
As commercial fleet operators—such as car rental, logistics, and 
delivery companies—increasingly rely on connectivity and software 
for vehicle management, their cybersecurity risks multiply.
In September 2023, a leading US\-based trucking and fleet management 
solutions provider experienced a ransomware attack that resulted in 
customers being unable to electronically log their on\-road hours—as required 
by federal regulations—or track their transported inventory.85 In response, the 
company hired external cybersecurity experts to investigate and applied for 
a waiver from the US Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to allow 
truckers to use paper logs until ‌
service was restored.86
Smart mobility IoT devices \& services
As smart mobility IoT devices and services continue to grow in 
popularity and use, they represent high\-risk targets within the 
Smart Mobility ecosystem.
 These services and devices hold sensitive PII and payment data from 
thousands of unique users. 
In July 2023, a cyberattack targeted the servers of a Polish city's Transport 
Authority, halting smart transportation systems. The attack impacted the 
city's public transportation ticketing system, traffic lights management, and 
electronic information boards at public transportation stops—causing city\-
wide traffic jams.87

Insurance
Insurance companies are realizing that the cyber\-threat 
landscape directly impacts premiums on connected vehicles. 
Insurers can leverage connected vehicle data to determine 
which locations, vehicle types, and components are usually more prone to 
cyber attacks, and calculate insurance premiums accordingly. 
New behavior\-based insurance models leverage aftermarket devices to share 
telematics with insurers to reduce premiums and insurance costs. However, 
threat actors can exploit vulnerabilities in these devices and manipulate data 
or communications to hack insurance companies' IT networks. Insurers and 
their telematics suppliers must work together to ensure that their telematics 
infrastructure is secure. 
Autonomous vehicles
Autonomous vehicle (AV) innovations are introduced at a rapid 
pace by many stakeholders, including OEMs, smart mobility 
and ride\-sharing services providers, and large technology 
enterprises. Other manufacturers are not far behind. Autonomous fleets are 
gaining momentum, delivering unprecedented efficiencies and customer 
experiences—but not without safety concerns and public distrust.
In October 2023, California ordered a US OEM’s AV to remove its driverless 
cars from state roads, after a pedestrian in San Francisco was struck by a 
human\-driven vehicle and then run over by a robotaxi.88 In November 2023, 
the same OEM recalled its entire US fleet of 950 driverless cars, but is 
currently planning a slow return to service as it works to overcome safety 
concerns and a lack of public trust.89 
Despite this, other AV companies are forging ahead with their own 
deployments and trials, acknowledging the above problems as the result of 
scaling too quickly before the technology was ready.90 
49
© 2024 Upstream Security Ltd. All Rights Reserved
On the technical side, new sensor types, software and hardware 
functionalities, services, and communication types expose potential 
vulnerabilities, increasing the likelihood of a future attack. Autonomous 
vehicles are equipped with and rely upon navigator sensors (e.g., GPS, LIDAR, 
cameras, millimeter wave radar, IMU) that receive data and directions from 
multiple sources, including the internet and satellites.
It is therefore possible for attackers to prevent the sensor from retrieving 
useful data, cause it to retrieve incorrect data, or manipulate the sensor's 
function through crafted data.97
In July 2023, Waymo’s co\-CEOs announced that given the tremendous 
momentum and substantial commercial opportunity they’re seeing on 
the ride\-hailing front, they’ve made the decision to focus efforts and 
investment in ride\-hailing—pushing back the timeline on technical, 
commercial, and operational efforts on trucking.91
In August 2023, Axios reported on several autonomous trucking 
companies that conducting testing in the Dallas\-Fort Worth area—
including Aurora, Gatik, Torc Robotics, and Kodiak Robotics—which 
expect to deploy driverless trucks in the next couple years.92
In October 2023, Waymo announced a partnership with Uber to offer a 
fully autonomous, all\-electric Waymo ride in the 225\+ square miles of 
Metro Phoenix where Waymo currently operates.93
In November 2023, May Mobility, which is backed by Toyota and 
BMW, announced a new funding round of $105 million to expand 
its on\-demand driverless transit shuttles in a handful of cities in 
Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota, and Texas.94
In November 2023, Motional, an AV developer, and Hyundai 
announced plans to jointly build IONIQ 5 robotaxis in Singapore for 
deployment in Las Vegas and other US cities in 2024\.95
In December 2023, Japan decided to assign an exclusive 
bandwidth for Level 4 self\-driving vehicles.96
This was demonstrated by the many announcements made in 2023:

The impact of Right to Repair on agriculture vehicles
Conflicts over the US Right to Repair of agricultural vehicles 
continued to make big headlines in 2023\. 
Agriculture vehicle owners, in particular, have turned to tractor 
hacking to bypass restrictions put in place by equipment manufacturers to 
prevent them from doing their own repairs, and to avoid digital lockouts on 
modern rigs. 
Some farmers are circumventing OEM restrictions by installing pirated 
firmware, which may leave them exposed to malware, spyware, or 
ransomware. Additionally, farmers looking to self\-repair their equipment 
without turning to authorized dealers may turn to online forums where they 
discuss software bugs, how to manipulate their vehicle systems, and swap 
code and data. Using unauthorized software and hacking equipment for self\-
repair can result in unintended installation of malware, spyware, ransomware 
and invalidate manufacturer warranties.
In response to the right to repair movement, several bills have been 
introduced across the US. It is their goal to require equipment manufacturers 
to provide software, codes, and tools to farmers and independent technicians 
so they can repair equipment themselves.
In April 2023, Colorado became the first state to pass a right to repair 
law for farmers—which will go into effect at the start of 2024\.98
In June 2023, the American Farm Bureau Federation signed a 
memorandum of understanding (MOU) with CLAAS of America, 
providing even more farmers and ranchers with the right to repair 
their own farm equipment.99 In 2023, AFBF entered into similar MOUs 
with John Deere, CNH Industrial Brands (which includes Case IH and 
New Holland), AGCO, and Kubota. In total, the five MOUs cover almost 
three\-quarters of the agricultural machinery sold in the US.
In November 2023, a US judge rejected Deere’s efforts to dismiss 
consolidated lawsuits and said Deere must face claims from crop 
farms and farmers that the agricultural machinery maker has 
unlawfully conspired to restrict services for maintenance and repair.100

Regulators worldwide are shifting focus to the growing cyber risks caused 
by the Right to Repair Act before they reach a “tipping point”. In June 
2023, NHTSA notified dozens of OEMs about safety concerns arising 
from the Massachusetts Right to Repair Act.101 The NHTSA reiterated that 
manufacturers must comply with all federal safety requirements. These 
recent developments and clear indications by NHTSA serve as important 
guidelines for OEMs and provide a path for future resolution of this conflict.

INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED ATTACKS 
OPEN THE DOOR FOR LARGE\-SCALE IMPACT 
ACROSS THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM
In 2023, cyber attacks became more sophisticated and frequent, 
targeting various vehicle systems and components, as well as smart 
mobility platforms, IoT devices and applications. New attack methods 
have made the industry acutely aware that any point of connectivity is 
vulnerable to attacks.
The attack landscape has driven the continued proliferation of the 
two new attack vectors that emerged back in 2022, which are the core 
of the smart mobility ecosystem: APIs for mobility applications and 
services, and EV charging infrastructure, which is expected to replace 
ICE fueling infrastructure in the next decade.
As a reminder, API\-based attacks showed a dramatic increase in 
2022, accounting for 12% of total incidents and demonstrating a 
staggering 380% growth. Moving forward we expect API\-based 
attacks to gradually expand as various threat actors will leverage API 
vulnerabilities for large\-scale attacks. Indeed, in 2023 APIs accounted 
for 13% of total incidents. 
In 2023, the Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem experienced 
a sharp increase in incidents targeting backend servers (telematics, 
applications, etc.) as well as infotainment systems. Server\-related 
incidents grew from 35% in 2022 to 43% in 2023; infotainment\-related 
incidents nearly doubled, increasing from 8% in 2022 to 15% in 2023\. 
This trend is directly related to the growing awareness and visibility into 
connected components (servers, infotainment systems). It is also a result 
of the established maturity of the automotive cybersecurity landscape 
and the attempt of threat actors to gain access to sensitive data and 
potentially vehicle control across a large scale of mobility assets.

A series of vulnerabilities, collectively known as CVE\-2023\-3028,103 were identified:
MQTT backend does not require authentication, allowing unauthorized 
connections from an attacker. 
Vehicles publish their telemetry data (e.g., GPS location, speed, odometer, 
fuel, etc.) as messages in public topics. The backend also sends 
commands to the vehicles as MQTT posts in public topics. As a result, an 
attacker can access the confidential data of the entire fleet.
MQTT messages sent by the vehicles or the backend are not encrypted or 
authenticated. An attacker can create and post messages to impersonate 
a vehicle or the backend. The attacker could then, for example, send 
incorrect information to the backend about the vehicle's location.
Backend servers can inject data into a vehicle's CAN bus by sending a 
specific MQTT message on a public topic. Because these messages 
are not authenticated or encrypted, an attacker could impersonate the 
backend, create a fake message, and inject CAN data into any vehicle 
managed by the backend.
TELEMATICS AND APPLICATION SERVERS
Throughout a vehicle's life, connected vehicles collect, transmit, and 
receive information from OEM backend servers and vehicle owners. This 
is accomplished by using two types of servers: telematics servers, which 
communicate with the vehicle, and application servers, which communicate 
with the vehicle’s companion applications.
Additionally, some vehicles have backend servers that communicate with 
third parties, such as insurance companies, fleets, car rental and leasing 
companies, EV charging networks, and more. 
By exploiting vulnerabilities in backend servers, a black hat actor could attack 
vehicles while they are on the road.
In June 2023, a security researcher from the Automotive Security 
Research Group (ASRG) discovered multiple vulnerabilities in MQTT, 
a widely adopted network messaging protocol used in connected 
vehicles, that allows an attacker to access and even manipulate 
the telemetry data of the entire fleet of vehicles using a popular 
telematics unit.102

REMOTE KEYLESS ENTRY SYSTEMS
Modern vehicles are protected against theft by using remote keyless entry 
systems that include smart key fobs with very strong cryptography and 
immobilizers. But remote keyless entry systems ‌
may accomplish the opposite, 
as vehicle theft and vehicle break\-ins continue to increase.
Wireless key fob manipulation is used by black hat actors to carry out their 
attacks freely. Publicly available hacking tutorials and devices sold online 
without registration have made these attacks popular.
Whenever a wireless key fob—which is equipped with a short\-range radio 
transmitter—is within close proximity to the vehicle, it transmits a coded radio 
signal to the receiver unit. Communication between the fob and vehicle can be 
manipulated using devices that can intercept and relay, replay, or jam the radio 
signal all together.

It is also possible for car thieves to break into vehicles using a signal 
jammer that blocks the communication between the key fob and the 
vehicle. This device prevents the owner from locking the vehicle, allowing 
thieves open access.
Jamming 
communication 
between a key 
fob and a vehicle
A new attack method favored by hackers is CAN injection, extensively 
used by criminals to steal vehicles. It is possible for attackers to bypass 
the entire remote keyless entry system with a CAN injector device that 
connects to the CAN wires and impersonates the wireless key fob ECU. 
Impersonating 
the wireless key 
fob ECU with 
CAN injection
The communication between the key fob mechanism and the vehicle can be 
attacked in a few different ways: 
A more sophisticated and expensive device can be used to reprogram the 
key fob system, rendering the original key useless. The reprogramming 
device—which connects to the OBD port, making it relatively easy for car 
thieves to gain full control over vehicles—can be legally obtained ‌
online and 
is used by authorized mechanics and service centers.
Reprogramming 
key fobs
In another type of relay attack, hackers intercept messages sent between 
the key fob and the vehicle and store them for later use. After obtaining the 
relevant message, the hacker can unlock the car's doors or start its engine 
whenever they want. 
Replay attacks 
using a stored 
signal
In relay attacks, hackers intercept the normal communication between the 
key fob and the vehicle—even when the key fob’s signal is out of range. 
Hackers can amplify the radio signal using a transmitter or repeater that is 
placed near the car, which amplifies and relays a message to unlock and 
start the vehicle's engine. Thieves increasingly use this type of attack to 
intercept the signal from a key fob located inside a vehicle owner’s house.

In January 2023, a security researcher discovered a vulnerability, 
described in CVE\-2022\-38766, that impacts the remote keyless 
system on a French OEM vehicle model. This vulnerability is based on 
the Rolling Code sets, a series of changing codes that is supposed 
to prevent replay attacks. In this case the researcher discovered that 
instead of generating new Rolling Code sets, the system was using the 
same Rolling Code sets for each door\-open request. This vulnerability 
allows an attacker to intercept and replay the signals, using a 
specialized device, and manipulate the keyless system.104
In February 2023, police in Glasgow, Scotland, issued a warning after 28 
vehicles were stolen in the city during January 2023, citing an increase 
in keyless vehicle thefts.105 On the same day, police in Suffolk, UK, 
warned citizens that keyless car theft has spiked after five luxury SUVs 
from a UK OEM were stolen in one month.106 Between March\-May 2023, 
similar announcements were made by the Waterloo Regional Police 
in Belgium,107 the Worcestershire Police in the UK,108 and the Franconia 
Police in Germany.109 In August 2023, the UK government announced 
plans to ban keyless vehicle hacking devices in an attempt to combat 
rising vehicle thefts, which have soared by 25% year\-on\-year.110
In April 2023, a cybersecurity researcher disclosed a new attack 
method, called CAN injection, which bypasses the entire smart key 
system by using a CAN injector device.111 The device can be connected 
to the control CAN bus from the headlight connector, the taillight 
connector, or even by punching a hole in a panel where the twisted pair 
of CAN wires go right past—to impersonate the smart key ECU. The 
researcher discovered the method after conducting a lengthy digital 
forensic investigation into the July 2022 theft of his Japanese OEM 
vehicle, following two previous failed attempts.112

59
ECUs
Electronic Control Units (ECUs)—responsible for engine, steering, braking, 
windows, keyless entry, and various critical systems—can be interfered with 
or manipulated. Hackers try to manipulate ECUs and take control of their 
functions by running multiple sophisticated systems at the same time.
In February 2023, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA) ordered a recall of nearly 17,000 Japanese OEM SUVs built 
between November 2019 and June 2021\. Software in the Hybrid 
Vehicle Control ECU, which is used to calculate the hybrid battery 
output, may not limit battery output as required, causing the hybrid 
system to shut down completely in certain conditions113\. It’s unclear 
what is the reason for the issue, but it could certainly evolve into a 
significant cyber risk. 
In November 2023, a hacker used a device with a microcontroller to 
read the CAN bus of a Japanese OEM vehicle, allowing him to keep the 
vehicle's ACC (accessory) relay energized when the engine is turned off, 
maintaining power to the stereo and infotainment system.114 This type 
of attack can lead to privacy violations, as well as potential exploitation 
of other vehicle systems. 
APIs 
Connected vehicles as well as smart mobility IoT and services use a wide range 
of external and internal APIs, resulting in billions of transactions per month. OTA 
and telematics servers, OEM mobile apps, infotainment systems, mobility IoT 
devices, EV charging management, and billing apps all rely heavily on APIs.
APIs also present significant and 
fleet\-wide large\-scale attack vectors, 
resulting in a wide range of cyber 
attacks, such as the theft of sensitive PII, 
backend system manipulation, 
or malicious remote vehicle control.

In contrast to hacking other types of systems, API hacking is relatively cost\-
effective and offers the ability to execute large\-scale attacks—it requires 
relatively low technical expertise, uses standard techniques, and can be carried 
out remotely without special hardware.
In the last two years, the Automotive industry and supply chains, as well as 
mobility devices and services, have experienced a significant increase in data 
and privacy breaches due to API\-based attacks.
In January 2023, a group of security researchers published a lengthy 
writeup of their months\-long work exploring the security of telematic 
systems, automotive APIs, and the infrastructure that supports them. 
They discovered multiple vulnerabilities across 19 major global OEMs 
and suppliers that allowed them to remotely control vehicles and 
access sensitive OEM and consumer data.115 
In March 2023, a security researcher disclosed that he gained access 
to a Japanese OEM’s CRM database by modifying the dev app to use 
the production API—which was unintentionally exposed through the 
loading spinner settings. A misconfigured API and a lack of proper 
authentication and verification resulted in the researcher being able to 
access names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, tax IDs, 
and vehicle / service / ownership history of the OEM’s customers.116
In July 2023, security researchers reported three critical vulnerabilities 
found in the API interfaces of a Charging Station Management System 
(CSMS) platform from a Switzerland\-based provider, allowing attackers 
to access files uploaded by other users, bypass the required provisioning 
PIN code (authentication), and hijack a charger's OCPP connection.117
In November 2023, security researchers from ASRG disclosed a 
vulnerability, described in CVE\-2023\-6073,118 which allows attackers to 
crash a specific ECU installed in German OEM vehicles and irreversibly 
change the volume to maximum levels via REST API calls.119 
The same month, a Tier\-2 supplier of a popular automotive platform chip 
disclosed a multi\-mode call processor memory corruption vulnerability, 
described in CVE\-2023\-22388,120 that occurs while processing the bit 
mask API, causing unexpected behavior and crashing the system.121

MOBILE APPLICATIONS
Increasingly connected and software\-defined vehicles allow OEMs to provide 
remote services via vehicle companion apps and third\-party apps, allowing 
owners to conveniently control critical functions using their smartphones and 
devices. Using mobile applications, users can track the location of vehicles, 
open their doors, start their engines, turn on auxiliary devices, and more.
The same apps that provide drivers with a digital experience can also 
be exploited by hackers to access the vehicle and backend servers. 
Companion applications may also have common software vulnerabilities, 
including open\-source vulnerabilities, hard\-coded credentials, and API/
backend server weaknesses.
OEM companion and smart mobility apps can also be used to commit 
identity theft. Black hat actors can exploit vulnerabilities in mobile devices 
and application servers to obtain credentials and compromise private user 
information on a large scale.
In May 2023, security researchers reported a vulnerability, known 
as CVE\-2023\-29857,122 in a popular third\-party application used by 
owners of US EV OEM. The vulnerability allows attackers to obtain 
sensitive information by directly accessing the application link.123
In June 2023, a popular ride\-hailing service in Pakistan with over 10 
million users was hacked, resulting in consumers receiving abusive 
messages and notifications. A third\-party communication API had 
been compromised, according to the company.124

INFOTAINMENT SYSTEMS
The in\-vehicle infotainment system (IVI) is one of the most common attack 
vectors. It connects to the internet, and is exposed to installed applications 
and short\-range communications with mobile phones and bluetooth devices. 
As a result, it has access to PII.
Additionally, IVI systems often connect to a vehicle's internal networks, 
posing a serious risk to the vehicle. IVI systems can be the path of least 
resistance for malicious software to penetrate ‌
internal systems.
In May 2023, a hacker and advocate for open\-source implementation 
in the Automotive industry, successfully hacked a Japanese OEM's 
infotainment system using a tool sold online and posted evidence 
of the exploit on GitHub. The hacker managed to install multiple 
applications via a USB drive, including a file manager and a third\-
party app over the Transmission Control Protocol.125
In August 2023, researchers from Germany successfully executed 
a jailbreak of a US EV OEM's IVI system using a voltage fault 
injection attack on the chip\-maker’s processor that gave them nearly 
irrevocable root access. The attack allowed the researchers to run 
arbitrary software on the infotainment system and unlock paid 
features such as faster acceleration and heated seats. Additionally, 
the exploit facilitated the extraction of a vehicle\-unique key 
(cryptosystem public key) used for authentication and authorization 
on the OEM’s internal service network. With the root permissions 
gained through the exploit, a malicious actor could access private 
user data, decrypt encrypted NVMe (Non\-Volatile Memory Express) 
storage, and manipulate the car's identity.126

EV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE
Providing a reliable and safe charging infrastructure is essential to accelerating 
the adoption of electric vehicles. But today, many chargers, charging 
infrastructure components and related apps are vulnerable to physical and 
remote manipulation that can stop them from working reliably, expose EV 
users to fraud and ransom attacks, and have widespread implications on the 
charging network, local electric grid, or even vehicle fleets.
In January 2023, a hacker exploited a popular screen sharing 
program to gain access to the underlying Operating System (OS) of 
a new 350\-kW charger from a US EV charging company. The hacker 
could access the OS menu, open the web browser, and navigate to a 
competitor's website while the charger app remained running in the 
background.127 An earlier incident occurred in which another hacker 
gained access to the charger's critical settings and could view things 
such as overheat protection.128 In both cases, the incidents aimed to 
raise awareness for electric vehicle charging security concerns.
In June 2023, security researchers discovered an internal database—
hosted on one of the most popular public cloud platforms, with 
no password, that contained millions of logs—nearly a terabyte of 
logging data belonging to a global EV charging service provider 
with a worldwide network of hundreds of thousands of EV charging 
stations. The database contained sensitive information about 
customers who used the EV charging network, including customer 
names, email addresses, phone numbers of fleet customers, names 
of fleet operators with vehicles that recharge the network, and 
vehicle identification numbers (VINs), and locations of EV public and 
residential charging points.129

BLUETOOTH
Bluetooth is a wireless communication technology that uses radio frequencies 
to connect devices and share data. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is the standard 
protocol used for sharing data between devices that vendors have adopted 
for proximity communication to unlock millions of vehicles, residential 
smart locks, commercial building access control systems, smartphones, 
smartwatches, laptops, and more. 
In March 2023, a team of French security researchers participating in a 
hacking contest demonstrated breaking into a US EV OEM IVI using an 
exploit. The exploit involved a heap overflow vulnerability and an out\-of\-
bounds write error in a Bluetooth chipset, giving the researchers root access 
to other subsystems.130 The exploit won the long\-running contest's first\-ever 
Tier\-2 award reserved for exceptionally impactful vulnerabilities and exploits, 
along with a $250,000 prize.131
OTA UPDATES
Over\-the\-Air (OTA) programming is a method for remotely managing software 
that allows for wireless distribution of new software, firmware, or configuration 
settings from a central location to all devices through the network. With the 
expansion of software\-defined architectures, OTA updates enable OEMs and 
their Tier\-1 and Tier\-2 suppliers to continuously update the SBOM to improve 
vehicle quality, safety, functionality and introduce new features.
Remote updates, however, are riskier than physical ones because wireless 
communications opens the door to numerous cyber attacks that can affect 
multiple vehicles—and even entire fleets, at once. 
Additionally, updates could be crucial to the vehicle's functionality. The failure 
of an OTA update could cause a severe vehicle malfunction, as it did in 
November 2023 for a US\-based EV OEM. The OEM released and then abruptly 
canceled an OTA update that offered bug fixes and improvements to a specific 
feature. As a result of the failed update, the infotainment systems, which are 
used to operate critical vehicle functions, of two vehicle models were bricked. 
The OEM stated that the issue was caused by a human error—the wrong build 
was sent out with the wrong security certificate—and that an OTA update 
would be made available to fix the issue and restore full functionality.132
As OTAs are used more frequently and leveraged by an increasing number of 
OEMs, Upstream’s AutoThreat® researchers continuously monitor OTA\-related 
activities in the deep and dark web. Our researchers have identified a growing 
interest by adversaries in exploiting OTA updates to execute cyber attacks.

V2X ATTACKS ARE AT THEIR INFANCY, BUT ARE EXPECTED 
TO BECOME MUCH MORE FREQUENT IN THE COMING YEARS
Telematics, smart mobility, in\-vehicle/mobility IoT, and other services require connected vehicles to 
share data with servers, apps, and various vehicle components.
Connected vehicle\-to\-everything (V2X), is the collective term for the technology enabling vehicles, 
infrastructure, and other active road users to be in constant communication by leveraging existing 
cellular network infrastructure. There are seven primary modes of vehicle connectivity:
Within a few years, vehicles will constantly communicate and interact with their 
surroundings through APIs, sensors, cameras, radars, mobility IoT modules, and more—
enhancing vehicle operation by processing various inputs from the environment.
The most profound addition will be the capability of a vehicle to communicate 
with other vehicles or devices on the road, and receive data from external sources 
such as EV chargers or road infrastructure.
V2I
Vehicle 
to Infrastructure
Wireless exchange of data between the vehicle and road infrastructure 
to get information about accidents, construction, parking, and more.
V2v
Vehicle

Data sharing between vehicles, typically including location, to avoid 
traffic jams and accidents.
V2N
Vehicle
to Network
Communication between vehicles, traffic lights, lane markings, and other 
forms of the road infrastructure network.
V2C
Vehicle 
to Cloud
Communication between a vehicle and cloud\-based backend systems 
allows the vehicle to process information and commands sent between 
services and applications.
V2P
Vehicle
to Pedestrian
Communication between vehicles, infrastructure, and personal mobile 
devices to inform about the pedestrian environment enabling safety, 
mobility, and environmental advancements.
V2D
Vehicle

It is expected that vehicles will interact with the entire environment around them, 
considering pedestrians and cyclists that may enter their lane, traffic conditions 
ahead, and data from traffic lighting and control systems at intersections.
The future of V2X will rely on new wireless communication technologies, 
such as DSRC and Cellular V2X (C\-V2X), which have been in testing for the 
past few years. C\-V2X uses 3GPP standardized 4G LTE or 5G mobile cellular 
connectivity to exchange messages between vehicles, pedestrians, and 
wayside traffic control devices such as traffic signals.133 Though both DSRC 
and C\-V2X enable the future of V2X, C\-V2X’s use of Long\-Term Evolution 
(LTE) is considered ‌
a potential game\-changer for the connected vehicles 
ecosystem. The ability to use existing cellular infrastructure will‌
 reduce 
the efforts required to accelerate adoption, while guaranteeing high\-speed 
communication in high\-density locations.134 
In April 2023, the FCC approved the C\-V2X technology for connected vehicles 
ahead of the final national framework for intelligent transportation systems 
(ITS) rules. The FCC's Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, the 
Engineering and Technology Bureau, and the Wireless Telecommunications 
Bureau granted a joint request submitted by automotive manufacturers, 
equipment manufacturers, and state departments of transportation seeking 
a nationwide waiver of several FCC rules to permit deployment of C\-V2X 
technology in the upper 30 MHz of spectrum in the 5\.895\-5\.925 GHz band.135
​
While the order is an important step toward the deployment of C\-V2X, many 
challenges still need to be resolved by the final rules, because the current 
FCC rules are based on the DSRC standard, which is not compatible with the 
C\-V2X standard.

GENERATIVE AI IS RESHAPING THE AUTOMOTIVE 
AND SMART MOBILITY ECOSYSTEM, 
BUT REGULATIONS ARE STILL EVOLVING
Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping the automotive industry, offering fully 
customizable driving experiences and personalized data\-driven features. 
It enhances safety by adapting to individual driving patterns through 
continuous learning. The global market for GenAI in the automotive industry 
was valued at $312 million in 2022, with projections reaching as high as $1\.7 
billion by 2030\.136
However, the growing influence of GenAI outlines associated risks and 
regulatory obstacles. Concerns such as the potential for inaccurate or 
harmful AI\-generated outputs are significant. The use of AI capabilities 
raises complex questions regarding safety, responsibility, and liability. 
The competitive pressure to adopt GenAI requires organizations to 
proactively develop strategies to manage risks as integration becomes 
more widespread. A comprehensive approach is required to navigate the 
multifaceted challenges associated with the rapid evolution of GenAI 
technologies, including the introduction of new cybersecurity risks.137
The landscape of GenAI regulations and guidelines is evolving across many 
industries, with the financial industry charging ahead. In November 2023, 
Singapore's Monetary Authority (MAS) launched a GenAI risk management 
framework and guidelines for financial institutions. These guidelines were 
developed in collaboration with several banks, as well as large technology 
vendors.138 In December 2023, the European Parliament also announced 
reaching a provisional agreement on the Artificial Intelligence Act.139 
This regulation will focus on ensuring fundamental rights are protected, 
establishing obligations for the use of AI based on risks and impact. This 
regulatory effort is also designed to enable the rapid proliferation of AI\-based 
technologies across the European market. 
Anticipating a similar trend, the Automotive industry is expected to witness 
the development of specific GenAI guidelines and risk management 
frameworks, focusing on ensuring safety and privacy among other concerns.

CYBERSECURITY REGULATIONS MAKE 
HEADWAY WORLDWIDE
Evolving regulations worldwide reflect a concerted effort by governments 
and regulators to adapt to technological advancements, promote safety, 
and address environmental concerns—showcasing a global commitment to 
shaping the future of the Automotive industry.
China
China has recently initiated various regulations and guidelines, 
demonstrating a wide effort to establish risk management frameworks 
related to the Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem. 
In December 2023, China's Ministry of Transport released trial guidelines for 
autonomous vehicle (AV) services, including robotaxis, self\-driving trucks, 
and robo\-busses. 
The nationwide guidelines, developed after a 16\-month period of public 
opinion seeking, standardizes rules and establishes comprehensive 
surveillance measures to ensure the safety of self\-driving vehicles. For 
example, AVs, regardless of their automation level, can only operate in 
specified areas:
Autonomous buses are restricted to "enclosed or roads 
with relatively simple conditions"
Robotaxis are allowed in "controlled and safe traffic conditions" 
Robo trucks face explicit restrictions, limited to "point\-to\-point 
highways or good traffic conditions" 
Operators must obtain permits and relevant licenses for public transportation 
services, and AVs should be clearly labeled for road awareness. Additionally, 
the guidelines make a singular reference to software, emphasizing that 
over\-the\-air upgrades must adhere to safety regulations from the Ministry of 
Industry and Information.140

70
The Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued 
a call for public opinions on four mandatory national standards, including 
Technical Requirements for Automobile Information Security, and Information 
Security Technical Requirements for Complete Vehicles. These standards 
were open for feedback until July 5, 2023\. 
While largely consistent with UNECE WP
.29 
R155, differences exist in areas such as the 
entity responsible for standard development, 
formulation, and effective time, vehicle 
security requirements, testing methods, and 
modification of vehicle types.
 The Chinese government aims to finalize the first version for review, 
with a process expected to lead to the standard's release in mid\-2024\. 
Implementation is anticipated 12 months after release, in mid\-2025\.141
In June 2023, the Chinese State Council issued a regulatory framework 
notice, emphasizing the necessity of advancing a high\-quality charging 
infrastructure system in China. The framework is a strategic response 
to address the challenges faced by China's rapidly growing charging 
infrastructure such as lack of standardization, poor construction, and 
unbalanced design. The framework also addresses the broader strategic 
objectives set for 2030, which include building a high\-quality charging 
infrastructure system with extensive coverage, moderate scale, a reasonable 
structure, and complete functions.142
Japan \& EU
In Japan and the EU, UN regulations (UN\-R157\-01 series) allow 
for approval of Level 3 autonomous driving devices with a speed 
limit of 130 km/h on highways and the ability to change lanes as 
of January 2023\. Future regulations will focus on unmanned (driverless) 
vehicles at Levels 4 and 5\.143

71
India
In April 2023, India implemented Real Driving Emissions (RDE) 
regulations for passenger cars, mandating compliance with emissions 
limits during on\-road driving. This regulation addresses the gap between 
testing conditions and real\-world driving emissions. RDE, inspired by tighter 
regulations in Europe, covers diverse driving conditions, reducing reliance on 
conformity factors that adjust emission standards for real\-world conditions. 
The suggestion is for Indian policymakers to set a timeline to phase out 
conformity factors. Notably, Europe is proposing that by 2025, all on\-road 
emissions from light\-duty vehicles measured during RDE testing should 
not exceed laboratory test limits under the boundary conditions of the RDE 
standards.144
Implementing RDE requires collecting and analyzing real\-time data from 
vehicles on the road. This data may include information related to emissions, 
engine performance, and driving patterns. Cybersecurity measures are 
necessary to protect this sensitive data from unauthorized access and 
potential misuse of the data.
In November 2023, following global standards, India proposed a mandatory 
security framework for vehicle manufacturers called “CyberShield”. The 
plan, backed by the Minister of Road Transport, aims to fortify vehicle 
systems against cyber vulnerabilities, extending protection to electric vehicle 
charging stations. The initiative recognizes the importance of preemptive 
cybersecurity measures in an increasingly interconnected automotive 
landscape, covering both passenger and commercial vehicles. The draft is 
set for expert scrutiny before parliamentary approval.145
United States
In August 2023, the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) 
launched an enforcement initiative to examine the extensive data collected 
by connected vehicles—through built\-in apps, sensors, and cameras. The 
move reflects a growing focus on privacy within the Automotive industry. The 
CPPA aims to ensure OEM transparency and compliance with consumer data 
rights, such as knowing what data is collected, preventing its dissemination, 
and requiring its deletion. The initiative highlights concerns about data 
management and may also impact industries beyond automotive, such as 
supply chain, logistics, and construction.146

THE EXPANSION OF UNECE WP
.29 R155 
AND ISO/SAE 21434 
In 2023, many automotive OEMs and their suppliers continued implementing 
R155 for Cyber Security Management System (CSMS) and Type Approval,147 
and WP.29 R156 for Software Update Management System (SUMS).148 
Based on the second milestone of R155, its scope will become mandatory 
for all new vehicles in production starting in July 2024\. In the past several 
months, some OEMs discontinued specific models based on expected R155 
compliance challenges and the upcoming second milestone.149 
Together with ISO/SAE 21434,150 these regulations are a part of the global 
effort to create a unified approach to protecting against cyber threats.
Due to regulatory changes, developments in industry standards, and research 
learnings, several organizations updated their guidelines and best practices, 
including the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA),151 
the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA),152 and member trade 
association Auto\-ISAC.153
It is important to note that both R155 and ISO/SAE 21434 avoid outlining 
specific solutions and exact processes, instead stressing the importance 
of implementing a high standard of cybersecurity analysis. The guidelines 
outline the process and specify risk analysis and response targets, 
emphasizing the need to consider life\-long cybersecurity threats and 
vulnerabilities during development, production, and post\-production phases.

REGULATORY IMPACT ON 
THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY
Together, the new regulations, standards, and guidelines are designed to 
ensure a high level of cybersecurity—resulting in better safety and security 
for customers, while establishing uniform terminology, guidelines, targets, 
and scope across the industry. Manufacturers need this flexibility to 
implement innovative cybersecurity approaches and continuously improve. 
ISO/SAE 21434, builds on ISO 26262 Road vehicles – Functional Safety 
standard, and requires automotive OEMs and suppliers to implement 
cybersecurity throughout the entire vehicle lifecycle. It focuses on adopting 
a ‘security from the group up’ mindset, and establishing engineering 
requirements for each step of product development and production, as well 
as the post\-production phase.
R155 requires OEMs to implement and maintain threat analysis and 
risk assessment (TARA) throughout all stages of the vehicle lifecycle.
 The complexity of performing effective TARA has changed dramatically 
as vehicles become more software\-defined and software components are 
continuously updated throughout the vehicle's life cycle. OEMs must also 
create processes to address and mitigate future attacks together with their 
Tier\-1 and Tier\-2 suppliers. Though the regulation applies to OEMs, the 
requirement to demonstrate that the CSMS includes the entire value chain 
expands the impact of R155 to suppliers. R155 applies to OEMs operating 
within the 54 countries that participate in the 1958 UNECE Transportation 
Agreements and Conventions.
With R155, OEMs and suppliers are better able to identify and respond to 
security risks associated with new and emerging vehicle architectures, 
mobility services, and the connected vehicle ecosystem. These include 
threats to:

75
The R155 regulation is unique both in its practical approach to automotive 
cybersecurity, with concrete examples of threats and specified mitigations. But 
it is also based on a holistic approach, covering process and governance, as 
well as IT, product, OT, and IoT perspectives.
In the regulation, the term 'processes' is emphasized clearly in an intent to 
provide guidance on cybersecurity structures without mandating low\-level 
technical specifications. Today's automotive cyber environment is diverse and 
dynamic, making rigid technical measures counterproductive. The regulation 
was intentionally drafted in a technology\-neutral way, giving some flexibility to 
OEMs to decide how to ensure the cybersecurity of their vehicles.
The UNECE regulations and the ISO/SAE 21434 standard have reached critical 
mass and are changing the operations around the world. With the upcoming 
expansion in July 2024, all new vehicles will be governed under R155\.
OEMs work closely with suppliers, and cybersecurity companies to support 
industry\-wide compliance and certification efforts, and establish robust 
cybersecurity governance structures and testing processes.
To boost collaboration among OEMs and suppliers, the European Automobile 
Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) and the European Association of Automotive 
Suppliers (CLEPA) joined forces with Auto\-ISAC in October 2022, to create a 
central European hub for information sharing on motor vehicle cybersecurity.156

76
ESTABLISHING LONG\-TERM TRUST 
WITH ISO/SAE 21434
A key differentiator between ISO/SAE 21434 and R155 is that the ISO/SAE 
standard provides OEMs and their suppliers with a comprehensive process 
for calculating asset risk, and suggests methods for calculating scores and 
prioritizing vulnerability urgency. 
The standard provides a structured cybersecurity framework, establishing 
cybersecurity as an integral element of engineering throughout the lifecycle 
of a vehicle, from the conceptual phase until decommissioning.
Additionally, to follow the ISO/SAE 21434 standard and R155 CSMS 
requirements, OEMs are encouraged to maintain a vSOC to enforce continuous 
monitoring for over a decade after vehicles roll off the assembly line.
With 378 new CVEs discovered in 2023 
as well as the sharp rise in deep and 
dark web activities, it is imperative that 
stakeholders continuously review and 
implement mitigation techniques to protect 
their products against both existing and 
future vulnerabilities and undiscovered 
vulnerabilities that may arise in the future.

THE REGULATORY LANDSCAPE 
CONTINUES TO MATURE
As the Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem evolves and new 
applications, devices, and services are introduced, policymakers are 
rethinking regulations. In addition to the critical milestone of R155, extending 
the scope to all new vehicles as of July 2024, around the world, legislators 
are becoming more aware of cybersecurity risks to vehicles, infrastructure, 
and consumer privacy. New laws, including those for autonomous vehicles, 
are being drafted to address these risks. 
The scope of R155 is expected to expand to 
include motorcycles and agricultural equipment
Modern two\- and three\-wheeled vehicles are becoming much more 
connected and designed to include multiple software\-components, sensors, 
electronic components, and advanced infotainment systems, all of which 
significantly increase cyber risks. The requirements to secure motorcycles 
are a part of the global effort to deepen safety and trust in the Automotive 
ecosystem. Indeed, in July 2023, the UNECE submitted a proposal to expand 
the scope of R155 to include all Category L vehicles, expanding beyond the 
current scope that includes L6 and L7\.157 If accepted, this proposal, initiated 
by CLEPA, will become effective as of July 2029 and will require motorcycle 
OEMs to implement CSMS. 
The UNECE is also discussing the option of adding Category T vehicles, 
agricultural machinery, as well as the related categories R (agricultural 
trailers) and S (interchangeable towed agricultural or forestry equipment) to 
the scope of R155\.158 Amid a lack of consensus on this expansion, a decision 
is expected during 2024\. 
The EU Cyber Resilience Act promotes 
extended cybersecurity resilience 
Updated in December 2023, the European Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) 
is a horizontal legislation, covering all products with digital components 
(both hardware and software).159 The focal point for the CRA is consumers, 
safeguarding their usage of modern connected devices, from smart watches 
to vehicles.

79
The CRA covers the entire lifecycle of products, offering a framework 
for cybersecurity governing the planning, design, development, and 
maintenance of products. The CRA also requires manufacturers to report 
actively exploited vulnerabilities and incidents, and mitigate risks effectively 
through the support period of the product.160 
The CRA is expected to enter into force in May 2024, with manufacturers 
obligated to comply within 36 months.161 
Determining the scope of the CRA is critical for OEMs and other mobility 
stakeholders. The CRA specifically excludes products covered by the General 
Safety Regulation (EU) 2019/2144,162 which also includes R155\. Therefore, 
vehicles under categories M, N, and some in category O, will be governed by 
R155\. Other vehicles will be subject to the CRA.163 As R155 expands its scope, 
it will also have a direct impact on the requirements to comply with the CRA.
ISO 15118 secures vehicle\-to\-grid communications
ISO 15118 “Road vehicles – Vehicle to grid communication interface”164 is 
the leading communications standard, covering also cybersecurity features 
and requirements and ensuring encrypted, secure communication between 
the electric vehicle (EV) and the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE).165 
It applies to category M and N vehicles, but encourages other OEMs to 
also adopt its framework. It also serves as the foundation for the high\-level 
communication protocol (HLC) for the Combined Charging System (CCS) 
standard for charging EVs.
Based on the need to establish trust in the EV charging process, the 
standard was designed to protect the grid and support the charging of 
multiple vehicles at once while preventing the grid from overloading.
The ISO 15118 standard governs a “Plug and Charge” operation involving three 
fundamental stages:166 
Confidentiality
Transport Layer Security 
(TLS v1\.2\) protocol is used 
to establish an encrypted 
communication session with a 
shared key that is valid for one 
charging session.
Data integrity
All messages are encrypted 
and decrypted during a charging 
session using the symmetric 
TLS session key.
Authenticity 
The authenticity of the sender 
and the integrity of the message 
are both verified using an Elliptic 
Curve Digital Signature Algorithm 
(ECDSA). 
© 2024 Upstream Security Ltd. All Rights Reserved
80
ISO 15118 applies to all entities involved in the charging process, including 
EVSE manufacturers, EV OEMs, charging point operators (CPOs); cloud service 
providers (CSPs, e.g., edge computing \& data storage); and electricity grids 
(e.g., utilities, building management systems, etc.).
The SEC echoes the increasing focus on cybersecurity incidents
In July 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted final 
rules on cybersecurity disclosure for publicly listed companies.167 
The final rules, which took effect on December 15, 2023, have two 
components: a requirement to disclose material cybersecurity incidents (using 
Form 8\-K) four business days after a public company determines the incident 
is material; and a requirement to disclose annually information (using Form 10\-
K) regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance.168 
Under the new rule, public companies traded under the SEC regulations 
must disclose the occurrence of a material cybersecurity incident and 
describe the material aspects of the nature, scope, and timing of the 
incident, as well as the material impact or reasonably likely material impact 
of the incident on the company, including its financial condition and results 
of operations. This disclosure is focused on the material impacts of a 
material cybersecurity incident.
The rules also allow the delayed reporting of cybersecurity incidents that pose 
a substantial risk to national security or public safety—contingent on written 
notification by the Attorney General—as well as 180\-day extensions for Smaller 
Reporting Companies.169 
In November 2023, a ransomware group, not knowing the effective date, tried 
to file an SEC complaint against a publicly listed company it attacked. This 
attack was performed against a provider of a loan origination system and 
digital lending platform for financial institutions. The attacker complained 
that its victim, the listed company, did not disclose the breach under the new 
rules.170 At the time of the alleged attack, the new SEC were not in effect yet 
and the targeted company reported it acted immediately upon discovery to 
mitigate the threat.
With these rules, the SEC emphasizes the importance of transparency and 
accountability in cybersecurity incidents and data breaches, which now must 
be reported to shareholders and the SEC as material events based on the well\-
established materiality standard.

NHTSA updates cybersecurity best practices 
In 2023, NHTSA released updated cybersecurity best practices for new 
vehicles.171 While these guidelines are non\-binding, their objective is to reflect 
evolving attack methods and the sense of urgency in mitigating cybersecurity 
risks across the entire ecosystem.
The standardization of cybersecurity practices across the Automotive industry, 
such as R155, and the release of NHTSA’s Cybersecurity Best Practices for 
Modern Vehicles172 signals that governments and regulators around the world 
understand the importance of protecting vehicles as they become more 
vulnerable to hacking. 
The final version of this iteration considers new industry standards and 
research and incorporates knowledge gained from real\-world incidents and 
comments submitted on the 2016 and 2021 drafts. NHTSA will continue to 
assess cybersecurity risks and update best practices as motor vehicles and 
their cybersecurity evolve.
NHTSA recommends a layered cybersecurity approach, based on the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework's five 
principal functions: 'Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover', including:
Risk\-based prioritization of protection for safety\-critical 
vehicle control systems and sensitive information
Timely detection and rapid response to potential threats 
and incidents
Rapid recovery when attacks do occur
Methods for accelerating the adoption of lessons learned across
the industry, including effective information sharing
New SEC cybersecurity regulations 
are expected to drive a wave of 
filings by automotive and mobility 
stakeholders as they are challenged 
with cybersecurity attacks. 
© 2024 Upstream Security Ltd. All Rights Reserved
82
The updated guidelines emphasize 
the connection between cybersecurity 
and safety, making it clear that as the 
Automotive industry becomes more 
connected, safety engineers and security 
stakeholders should also consider the 
ability of adversaries to manipulate signals. 
The latest recommendation from NHTSA is inspired by ISO/SAE 21434 in 
structure and process, but is also affected by R155 as it includes the protection 
from remote attacks.
NHTSA guidelines emphasize the importance of collaboration to ensure 
security and safety, suggesting participation in Auto\-ISAC as a means of 
effective information sharing across the industry. Upstream is a proponent 
of this; as collaborative community members, we maintain the Upstream 
AutoThreat® Intelligence Cyber Incident Repository173 and share insights in our 
annual report. Upstream is also a proud partner and sponsor of Auto\-ISAC174 
and ASRG,175 where industry knowledge sharing occurs and cybersecurity best 
practices take shape.
Updated approach to ADS and ADAS
Automation is constantly evolving, and NHTSA is developing regulations for 
Automated Driving Systems (ADS) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems 
(ADAS). In April 2023, NHTSA issued the Second Amended SGO 2021\-01 – 
Incident Reporting for Automated Driving Systems and Level 2 Advanced Driver 
Assistance Systems.176 
The updated SGO went into effect May 15, 2023 for 3 years, and includes 
updates to reporting requirements established in the original SGO, which 
was issued in 2021\. It enables NHTSA to receive standardized, timely, and 
transparent data of actual accidents involving ADS and Level 2 ADAS vehicles—
which is essential to identifying potential safety concerns with automated 
technologies that are rapidly evolving and being tested on public roads. 
In July 2023, NHTSA also created the Office of Automation Safety, and the 
Automation Exemptions Division under NHTSA's existing Office of Rulemaking 
to focus internal resources on this sector.177

NHTSA favors safety and cybersecurity over the Right to Repair 
The Right to Repair refers to the ability of vehicle owners and independent 
repair shops to access the information, tools, and software necessary to 
diagnose, service, and repair vehicles. In the context of modern vehicles, which 
are equipped with advanced technologies and complex systems, the Right to 
Repair has become a significant issue—making big headlines in 2023\.
In June 2023, in a dramatic move, 
NHTSA sent a letter to dozens of 
OEMs stating safety concerns related 
to the Massachusetts Right to Repair
Act,178 warning them to ignore the 
law amid cybersecurity concerns. 
NHTSA further clarified that it expects vehicle manufacturers to fully comply 
with federal safety obligations.
A few more NHTSA updates for 2023
In August 2023, NHTSA issued a proposed rule which requires OEMs to equip 
vehicles with seat belt use warning systems for the right front passenger and 
rear seats to increase seat belt use. The proposed regulations would apply to 
passenger cars, trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger vehicles weighing 
less than 10,000 pounds.179 
In September 2023, NHTSA addressed safety recommendations related to 
reducing speed\-based traffic fatalities issued by the National Transportation 
Safety Board (NTSB) regarding rear impact guards and adaptive driving beam 
(ADB) headlamps.180 
Both initiatives may draw the attention of fraud operators, looking for cyber\-
driven methods to disable safety features and manipulate vehicle systems. 
Once published on deep or dark web forums and marketplaces, these 
manipulations may be also used by other malicious actors. These potential 
manipulations, regardless of the motivation, not only compromise safety, but 
may also void warranty.

EV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE 
CYBERSECURITY REGULATIONS 
CONTINUE TO EXPAND
EVs currently make up approximately 15% of global new car sales181, with an 
expectation to reach the majority market share of new car sales by 2040\.182 
With the number of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) growing rapidly, 
the market has been challenged by attempts of threat actors to compromise 
and manipulate EVCS all over the world. 
EVCS are connected IoT devices that contain components from multiple 
vendors and are installed rapidly to meet market requirements. This makes 
them exposed to multiple attack vectors: 
Charging Point Operators (CPOs) are a vital stage in the charging 
ecosystem, but can be attacked on a wide scale by hacking the 
backend Command and Control (C\&C) servers. CPOs can be 
attacked remotely by targeting multiple charging stations or by 
creating extensive charging demand, causing a widespread denial 
of service. Additionally, attackers can gain unauthorized access 
to private consumer data, including personal information (PII) and 
charging patterns.
API\-based attacks often require a lower threshold of cyber and technical 
skills. This attack vector leads to a simpler yet sufficient attack 
surface with potential fleet\-wide impact. API attacks can target and 
impact backend servers, resulting in potential data theft or a denial 
of service. API attacks can emerge from any entity in the ecosystem 
communicating with it and vice versa, including vehicles themselves, 
charging stations, mobile apps, third\-party applications, etc.
As the number of EVs continues to rise, new standards are emerging focused 
on EV chargers and charging infrastructure. 
EV charging standards will focus on 
providing safe, reliable, and accessible 
chargers, as well as managing increased 
electricity demand on the grid.

85
02
Regulations protecting EVCS can be divided into two major categories:
01
Guidelines on how EVCS should safely communicate 
with backend servers, vehicles, the CSMS, how 
data is stored and encrypted, etc. This includes ISO 
15118, OCCP (currently in transition between 1\.6 to 
2\.0\.1\), CHAdeMO, and IEC 63110 which is currently 
under development. These operational standards 
are made by EVCS manufacturers themselves along 
with vehicle OEMs to ensure data integrity.
Consists of the actual actions and preconditions 
to be met by EVCS operators, along with the 
theoretical frameworks that lead to its creation. 
Regulations are enforced by the state on the 
national or regional level. This includes the US NIST 
IR 8473, the EU NIS2 Directive, Cyber Resilience and 
Cyber Solidarity Acts, UK Electric Vehicles (Smart 
Charge Points) Regulations, and more (further 
discussed in this report).

United States
In March 2023, the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure 
Standards and Requirements by the US Federal Highway Administration 
(FHWA) came into effect.183 This new rule establishes the requirements 
and minimum standards related to projects funded under the National 
Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program and projects for 
the construction of publicly accessible EV chargers under certain statutory 
authorities, including any EV charging infrastructure project funded with 
Federal funds that is treated as a project on a Federal\-aid highway. 
Essentially, FHWA adopted the principles of ISO 15118 and requires charging 
station conformance to ISO 15118 and Plug and Charge capability by one 
year after the date of publication of the Final Rule in the Federal Register. 
This legislation highlights the value in adopting a national standard for 
compliance, even though many chargers on the market are not currently 
using ISO 15118\.184 
The rule mandates the implementation of appropriate physical strategies 
for the location of the charging station and cybersecurity strategies that 
protect consumer data and ensure the safety of charging infrastructure 
and power grids. 
In October 2023, the US Department of Commerce's National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST) finalized its guidance for managing 
cybersecurity risks for EV extreme fast charging infrastructure with NIST IR 
8473 – Cybersecurity Framework Profile for Electric Vehicle Extreme Fast 
Charging Infrastructure.185 EV charging stations and charging infrastructure 
are vulnerable to a wide range of cybersecurity threats since they rely on 
complex infrastructure, interconnectivity, and multiple data networks. NIST IR 
8473 offers a holistic framework, covering the entire EV charging landscape. 
 
The guidelines include:
Electric vehicles
Extreme fast charging (XFC)
XFC cloud or third\-party operations
Utility and building networks
Furthermore, NIST IR 8473 has a well\-established section for data protection, 
based on the ISO 21434 standard.186 
© 2024 Upstream Security Ltd. All Rights Reserved
87
The framework suggested by NIST is voluntary, but it’s designed to help 
EV charging stakeholders to develop specific processes to understand, 
assess, and communicate their cybersecurity posture as a part of their risk 
management process. 
EU
ETSI EN 303 645 regulation for IoT devices was issued by the 
European Telecommunications Standards Institute. ETSI EN 303 645 was 
specifically designed to ensure data protection and integrity in smart 
connected devices. The regulation is currently being reviewed with proposed 
final requirements to be presented on August 1, 2025\.187 
NIS2 Directive focuses on establishing cybersecurity standards and 
resilience for the critical infrastructure and energy sectors, thus including 
EVCS under the regulatory coverage. NIS2 Directive also covers the EU Cyber 
Solidarity Act which refers to cybersecurity protection for IoT devices.188 The 
initiative aims at achieving detection, prevention and response to cyber risks 
and vulnerabilities. This includes forming SOC (security operation center) 
infrastructure within member countries to ensure coordinated handling of 
cyber threats.189 The framework will become mandatory on October 17, 2024\.
The EU Cyber Resilience Act covers digitally connected devices including IoT 
devices. The Act is expected to be implemented by the beginning of 2024\.190 
Also, ISO 15118 is partially and voluntarily implemented in Europe under the 
project name “Plug \& Charge Europe”. Although accepted by notable OEMs 
and EVCS operators throughout the region, there is no planned timeline 
for a full\-scale implementation of the standard in the EU.191 192 The relevant 
regulations are set to be implemented during 2024\-2025, and the region has 
already started voluntarily accepting ISO 15118\.
UK
In December 2021, a proposition was made to include EVCS under 
the British Standard Institutes’ (BSI) regulation for smart appliances (ESA) 
with smart energy.193 
The UK is at the forefront of EVCS regulations, introducing the Electric 
Vehicles (Smart Charge Points) Regulations 2021, which came into force in 
June 2022 and applies to private charge points (domestic or workplace).194 
© 2024 Upstream Security Ltd. All Rights Reserved
88
The UK regulation specifies that chargers must meet the following 
requirements: smart functionality such as demand\-side response services; 
electric supplier interoperability; enabled charging even with loss of 
communications network access; enhanced safety features; measuring 
system for increased transparency on charging statistics; default off\-peak 
charging schedule; randomized delay to protect from surges in demand; 
statement of compliance for compliance assurance; and register of sales for 
ten years. New cybersecurity requirements are also outlined in Schedule 1 
of the regulation, which came into effect in December 2022\.195 Chargers will 
come preconfigured with these settings, but owners can adjust them to suit 
their preferences.
A guidance letter for EVCS sellers and operators, published in February 
2022 and most recently updated in June 2023, suggests matching EVCS 
cybersecurity requirements to the European ETSI EN 303 645 standard. 
ETSI EN 303 645 was chosen based on its suggested benchmark and 
measurable objectives.196 
Japan
Cybersecurity protection of EVCS in Japan can be derived from 
regulations covering IoT devices such as METI (Ministry of Economy, 
Trade and Industry) IoT Security and Safety Framework from November 
2020197 and MIC (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications) IoT 5G 
Comprehensive Security Measures from June 2019\.198

OPERATIONAL EV CHARGING 
STANDARDS WORLDWIDE
ISO 15118
ISO 15518 is the leading global cybersecurity standard to ensure encrypted, 
secure communication between the EVs and charging stations (EVSE/
EVCS) while charging,199 and is considered as the high\-level communication 
protocol, functioning as the security standard for the Combined Charging 
System (CCS).200 
The ISO 15118 standard governs a “Plug and Charge” operation involving 
three fundamental stages:
ISO 15118 covers Vehicle to Grid (V2G) cybersecurity aspects and applies to 
all entities involved in the charging process:
EVs 
CPOs
Cloud operators in charge of data processing and storage
Power grids (also referred to as Utility / Building Management Systems)
Authenticity 
sender and received 
messages are ensured 
using Elliptic Curve 
Digital Signature 
Algorithm (ECDSA).201
Data integrity 
messages are kept 
intact and untampered 
using a pair of private 
and public keys.
Confidentiality
messages are encrypted 
using TLS protocol.
© 2024 Upstream Security Ltd. All Rights Reserved
90
Combined Charging System (CCS)
One of the most prominent charging protocols, supported by multiple OEMs 
worldwide. CCS cybersecurity measures are covered under ISO 15118\.202 
DIN SPEC 70121
DIN SPEC 70121 is the German predecessor to the ISO 15118 and was built 
on the theoretical principles of an initial, unpublished version of ISO 15118\. 
DIN SPEC 70121 does not include any of the updated features of ISO 15118, 
such as smart charging and secure TLS communication.
CHAdeMO
A Japanese standard (stands for “Charge de Move”) that was created by OEMs 
including Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Toyota. CHAdeMO was first introduced in 
2009 and aims to provide an alternative to the ISO 15118 standard.203 Similar 
to ISO 15118, CHAdeMO covers V2G security aspects. The charging process is 
enabled by matching the user’s VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) along with 
IPv6 security measures and contract key encryption.
In September 2023, CHAdeMO released the Design Guideline for External 
Charging ver.2\.0\.1, adding technical and operational requirements for safely 
integrating or retrofitting the Automated Connection Devices \- Underbody 
(ACD\-U) charging systems to CHAdeMO chargers/V2X equipment, EVs and 
plug\-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs).204 
OCPP 2\.0\.1
Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) was created by the Open Charge Alliance 
and was introduced in 2013, and is currently migrating from version 1\.6 to 
2\.0\.1\. OCPP is a prominent open\-source secure communication standard for 
EVCS and CSMS. The standard operates alongside ISO 15118\. 
Notable improvements from version 1\.6 to 2\.0\.1 include features for 
streamlined device management and improved transaction handling (for 
operators managing multi\-vendor charging points), enhanced security with 
secure updates and authentication (using secure TLS encryption), and 
support for ISO 15118\.205 
While ISO 15118 secures the communication between the vehicle to the 
charging station, OCCP covers the security aspects between the charging 
stations themselves and the backend servers. This includes the CPO, 
telecommunications, and electricity management.206

VEHICLE DATA AND PRIVACY REGULATIONS 
ARE INEVITABLE
Connected vehicles raise unique data privacy and cybersecurity issues that 
must be addressed by OEMs and regulators. Much of the data generated by 
vehicles can be considered personal data, and most consumers feel they 
need legislation to protect their data.207 Regulators around the world are 
taking notice and are developing consumer\-centric vehicle data privacy and 
security standards. 
In September 2023, the Mozilla Foundation assessed 25 leading OEMs on 
privacy and security and found poor results across the board:208 
Excessive collection of personal data
Sharing or selling of personal data
No consumer control over their personal data
Willingness to share data with government and 
law enforcement agencies
Poor cybersecurity track record
In the US, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the regulatory agency 
governing data privacy, and NHTSA currently advocate for industry self\-
regulation,209 but individual states are adopting vastly different approaches, 
and many haven’t started at all. So far, only a handful of states have enacted 
data privacy laws that specifically address connected vehicles, although 
several more are pending in legislatures across the US. Additionally, states 
can opt to cover connected vehicle data via comprehensive privacy bills. 
Proposition 24, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CPRA), is a prime 
example.210 The CPRA prohibits automakers and insurance companies from 
using precise geolocation without the permission of the consumer. 
In the EU, regulators are developing new regulatory frameworks for data and 
artificial intelligence, with major implications for the Automotive industry.211 
The EU Data Act, agreed upon in June 2023, establishes principles for data 
access, user rights, fair contractual terms, public sector data access, and 
cloud service provider flexibility. These legislative developments aim to strike 
a balance between regulation and innovation in the evolving AI and data\-
driven Automotive industry.212 
© 2024 Upstream Security Ltd. All Rights Reserved
92
The Data Act will ensure fairness in the digital environment, stimulate a 
competitive data market, and open opportunities for data\-driven innovation 
by allowing users of connected devices to access their data and share that 
data with third parties to provide aftermarket or other data\-driven innovative 
services.213 
In November 2023, the EU Council adopted the Data Act.214 Despite the broad 
scope of the legislation, sector\-specific laws are being negotiated, including 
for the Automotive industry, where issues like vehicle data access and data 
modification pose challenges. 
Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
in vehicles presents challenges 
for legislators, particularly concerning 
software updates and access to 
in\-vehicle data.
In December 2023, the European institutions—EU Commission, Council, 
and Parliament—reached a provisional political agreement on the world's 
first comprehensive law on AI—the new AI Act, intending to create a broad 
regulatory framework, indirectly impacting autonomous vehicles. 
Work is ongoing to refine the drafting, and formal adoption by both 
Parliament and Council is anticipated in early 2024\.215 The UNECE also 
proposed guidelines for AI\-related software updates, recommending approval 
authority engagement for impactful updates. 
Autonomous and connected vehicle data and privacy laws are inevitable. In 
2024\-2025, we anticipate new regulations for the US and EU markets that 
require opt\-in or minimally opt\-out consent from consumers. As regulations 
continue to evolve, OEMs need to make strategic decisions about their own 
data privacy and security policies to maximize mutual trust, compliance and 
consumer protection.

THREATS FROM THE 
DEEP AND DARK WEB
Cyber threat intelligence

smart mobility stakeholders 
actionable and proactive risk 
mitigation, amid the growing 
impact of cyber risk

Clear Web
The first layer of the internet is the clear/surface web—it is 
the smallest yet most familiar part of the internet, requiring 
only a web browser to access.216 In this part of the web, 
information is indexed by popular search engines, making 
it highly accessible and relied on by people every day.
The second layer of the internet is the deep web—which 
accounts for 96% of all web pages on the internet.217 Data 
on this part of the web is not indexed by search engines, 
either because it is behind a sign\-in (e.g., paywall), or its 
owners have blocked web crawlers from indexing. For 
the average person, the deep web includes paid content, 
subscription websites, private groups, and private business 
websites. For hackers, the deep web also includes 
imageboards, which host anonymous, provocative, 
borderline illegal content.
The third and final layer of the internet is the dark 
web—a fairly hidden part of the web where malicious 
activities, crime, and stolen data are available. To 
access dark web forums, users must use a special 
browser (e.g., Tor), know the site url (i.e., no domain 
names on the dark web), and often demonstrate 
familiarity with specific topics to the site admin to 
gain access. Forums or pages are often managed by 
moderators and suspicion is always high due to a lack of 
transparency among users and also because of the type of 
information in forums.
The internet has a depth with multiple layers, some of which are not indexed. 
There are three main layers of the internet: clear, deep, and dark. Access to each 
layer requires different know\-how and tools. On dark web forums, for instance, 
users must know the unique resource location address (i.e., no domain 
names exist on the dark web), use a special browser, and often demonstrate 
familiarity with specific topics to the site admin to gain access.

Almost all dark web hackers use proxy servers along with a Tor browser to 
maintain their anonymity. A tool called proxychain is used to chain several 
(usually 3\-5\) proxy servers. In this case, packets from the attacker go through 
multiple proxy servers. Proxy servers are intentionally used in rival countries 
so that one country can’t share security information (e.g., proxy logs) with 
another country—making it more difficult to identify hackers. 
During 2023, Upstream’s AutoThreat® researchers detected a 156% increase 
in deep and dark web findings compared to 2022, targeting OEMs, Tier\-1 
suppliers, Tier\-2 suppliers for the automotive industry, mobility IoT devices, and 
platforms. 
 This data, together with the fact that in 2023—nearly 65% of deep and dark 
web cyber activities had the potential to impact thousands to millions of 
mobility assets218 — show that automotive and mobility stakeholders must 
have deep access and visibility into cyber threat intelligence to proactively 
protect themselves.

GRAY HATS BLURRING THE LINE BETWEEN 
BLACK HATS AND WHITE HATS
Traditionally, the term black hats denotes malicious actors seeking to exploit 
vulnerabilities, while the term white hats represents cybersecurity experts 
working to enhance defenses. Nevertheless, the distinction is progressively 
fading in the Automotive industry—who’s becoming more connected and 
software\-defined—giving rise to "gray hat" involvement that now includes 
consumers who modify their vehicles or jailbreak components/features for 
customization purposes.
In October 2023, Upstream found that guidelines for jailbreaking the in\-
vehicle infotainment (IVI) system were published on deep web automotive 
forums. Using the hack, they were able to sideload unauthorized third\-party 
applications, unlock hidden features, and remove system safety restrictions, 
such as watching videos while driving. Jailbreaking the IVI and installing 
unauthorized apps can expose consumers to cybersecurity vulnerabilities 
and void their warranties. Untrustworthy software may contain malware, 
spyware, and ransomware, as well as cause system stability issues resulting 
in crashes, failures, or incompatibilities.

WHAT OCCURS IN THE DEEP AND DARK WEB?
There are estimates that the deep and dark web accounts for 96% to 99% of 
the internet, which makes most of it private.219 A wide range of automotive\-
related content can be found on deep and dark web forums, marketplaces, 
mobile messaging applications, and paste sites. 
Often, consumers rely on web forums to find information that OEMs are 
reluctant to share with them—specifically information that can help them 
pirate\-fix their vehicles or manipulate systems. Additionally, marketplaces 
are known to offer auto parts, components, chips, software, and other items 
for sale in violation of manufacturers’ terms and agreements. Many vehicle 
owners engage in these activities without realizing the dangers of tampering 
with highly sophisticated automotive technology.
These activities can have an impact on automotive stakeholders as well as 
insurance companies. Vehicles that have been tampered with may report 
false information that seems legitimate. In extreme cases, threat actors can 
gain access to OEM or insurance company servers by reverse engineering 
data that's already used to grant authorization to vehicles.

THREAT ACTORS MAY DISRUPT NEW AUTOMOTIVE 
AND MOBILITY IOT REVENUE STREAMS
Threat actors are increasingly exploiting opportunities for bypassing 
premium features by jailbreaking systems, posing considerable risks to both 
vehicle/device cybersecurity and data\-driven commercialization.
Upstream has been tracking a popular middle\-eastern threat actor, with over 
38,000 followers on social media, who openly provides jailbreak services and 
custom software for IVI systems of various OEMs—including features such 
as Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, diagnostic services, and firmware upgrades. 
According to the threat actor, it offers unique features not available through 
conventional dealerships.
This finding highlights the growing 
challenges associated with securing 
connected vehicles against unauthorized 
modifications, firmware updates, and 
diagnostics access. It also raises questions 
regarding the effectiveness of existing 
security measures. 
As threat actors gain expertise in specific IVIs, ECUs, and TCUs, it becomes 
critical for OEMs and the supply chain to establish visibility into the deep and 
dark web threat landscape so they can strengthen their security protocols to 
safeguard against them. 
In September 2023, a high\-profile Eastern European threat actor started 
selling unauthorized remote access to diagnostic software for various 
European OEMs on a deep web automotive forum. Providing unauthorized 
access to such software is in violation of the OEM's terms and conditions, 
and may result in limited OEM visibility of user access to premium features 
and loss of revenue.
In another example, in October 2023, Upstream identified a South European 
threat actor selling root access to IVI systems of various OEMs on a deep 
web forum, enabling the activation of hidden features. The threat actor 
indicated that the head unit could be jailbroken to accept unofficial files and 
modifications, enabling the user to browse folders, install apps, play videos 
while driving, and even tamper with the navigation system.

Forums
In the deep and dark web, there are automotive\-related forums dealing with 
sharing or selling automotive software, chip and engine tuning, infotainment 
cracking, reverse engineering, key\-fob modifications, immobilizer hacking, 
and automotive software—although general hacking forums also contain 
automotive\-related hacks. 
In these forums, information, insights, hacks, and software manipulations 
are constantly traded. Tuning ECUs is a common topic of discussion, along 
with jailbreaking infotainment systems, source codes, data breaches, and car 
hacking tools and tutorials. 
It is not uncommon for people to ask about self\-programming their vehicles 
for a variety of reasons, such as saving money or claiming the Right to 
Repair. Additionally, ECU remapping lessons, guides, software, and tuned file 
demos are readily available.
In September 2023, Upstream’s AutoThreat® PRO team uncovered a threat 
actor operating in a popular deep web automotive forum selling remote 
jailbreak solutions for IVI systems of a European OEM. The jailbreak consists 
of a CAN patch that enables all features except subscription\-based ones, 
including Android Auto, Android screen mirroring, Apple CarPlay, voice 
control, video while driving, and updates to firmware and maps.

Marketplaces
Dark web marketplaces are commercial websites that require specialized 
browsers, like Tor or I2P, and registration to access. They function primarily 
as black markets—brokering transactions involving drugs, weapons, cyber\-
arms, stolen data, forged documents, and other illicit goods.220 
Some automotive\-related dark web marketplace listings offer vehicle\-related 
“products” and services like forged documents, and user credentials for 
automotive applications and smart mobility services (e.g., OEM connected 
car services, shared mobility services). 
There are many automotive\-related discussions and offerings in deep and 
dark web marketplaces:
Instructions and guides related to infotainment hacking, CAN bus 
reverse engineering, chip tuning, and software hacks or illegal 
upgrades
The sale or exposure of OEM\-related information and credentials 
stolen in data breaches
Information and sale of tools for vehicle theft or modification, 
including key signal grabbers, key\-fob programmers, GPS 
jammers, radar detectors, and more
Hacks or fraud related to car\-sharing or ride\-sharing accounts
Sales of fake driving licenses or automotive insurance
In October 2023, Upstream uncovered threat actors selling consumer 
databases of multiple OEMs on dark web marketplaces.
In 2023, Upstream also discovered a threat actor selling login credentials of 
global OEMs' employees and dealers on a popular dark web marketplace.

Messaging applications
As online activities shift to mobile devices, mobile messaging applications 
have become increasingly popular for illicit activities.
Popular messaging applications—such as Telegram, Discord, Signal, and 
WhatsApp—are actively being used to share hacking methods, and trade 
in stolen credit cards, account credentials, exploitations of vulnerabilities, 
leaked source codes, and malware. 
Applications like these have replaced the secretive, hard\-to\-navigate dark 
web forums.
In June 2023, Upstream discovered a post on a ransomware Telegram 
channel leading to data stolen from a Japanese OEM, including sensitive 
customer PII.

In August 2023, Upstream uncovered information about a Linux kernel 
exploit impacting many large OEMs, known as CVE\-2023\-3269, posted on a 
10,000\-member cybercrime Telegram channel. 
In December 2023, Upstream tracked Eastern European threat actors 
operating on a popular Telegram channel, selling a relay attack keyless 
repeater promising the ability to unlock and start vehicles of multiple 
OEMs. Sellers are highly active and responsive and have a long history of 
unauthorized vehicle access tools.

THREAT ACTORS IN THE DEEP AND DARK WEB
Security researchers
Researchers use their technical expertise to identify cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities within organizations and across industries. To be effective, 
researchers need to stay up to date on the latest attack vectors, trends, 
and new enabling technologies. Many security researchers publish their 
findings—which include vulnerability exploits and vehicle toolkits—in public 
code repositories hosting services like GitHub. The knowledge that security 
researchers share is usually public, making it accessible to anyone, including 
malicious threat actors. 
In January 2023, a security researcher hacked the head unit of a South 
Korean OEM vehicle model. The researcher was able to root the unit, enabling 
him to add and delete features, by reverse\-engineering the head unit's 
firmware—which is also used across a wide range of other vehicle models, 
putting many more head units at risk.221 
In October 2023, a security researcher exposed risks caused by 
misconfigured third\-party self\-hosted data loggers used by US EV OEM 
consumers.222 Using open\-source intelligence techniques (OSINT), the 
researcher was able to find data loggers configured without authentication, 
and access their dashboards—allowing them to track live location, check if 
driver is present in car or not, take the car offline (e.g., sleep mode), check 
if the trunk of the car is open or not, and more. The researcher highlighted 
the potential risks, including the possibility of physical harm, outlined steps 
owners can take to protect themselves, and shared the OEM's response to his 
disclosure and suggestions.

Fraud operators
Fraud operators typically use the deep web to buy and sell diagnostic tools, 
software, chip tuning services, and mileage fix services. 
One of the most popular fraud services on the deep web is mileage fix, 
formally known as odometer fraud, which involves disconnecting, resetting, 
or altering a vehicle's odometer to change the number of miles shown. 
Every year, over 450,000 vehicles are sold with false odometer readings, 
costing American buyers over $1 billion, according to the NHTSA.223 
In September 2023, Upstream discovered a threat actor selling mileage 
blockers and odometer programming tools (e.g., used for mileage correction) 
for specific vehicles made by Western European OEMs on a deep web 
automotive marketplace.

Black hat hackers
Black hat hackers, operating in different deep and dark web forums and 
marketplaces, compromise cybersecurity with malicious intent and are 
involved in a wide range of activities. Some black hat hackers specialize in 
short\-range hacking, such as hacking remote entry systems to steal vehicles, 
while others specialize in long\-range hacking, mainly exploiting vulnerabilities. 
When black hat hackers publish exploits for long\-range vulnerabilities in 
deep and dark web forums, they expose many other threat actors to exploits 
that could crash or control vehicles, which may result in serious safety risks 
on a large scale. 
In January 2023, Upstream discovered that black hat hackers had published an 
exploit for a Linux vulnerability impacting multiple OEMs on a cybercrime forum. 
Exploiting this vulnerability could cause a denial of service on the affected 
vehicles, leading their systems to crash. Moreover, exploiting the vulnerability 
could enable attackers to run commands on affected vehicles remotely.
Car enthusiasts
Many car enthusiasts—people with a passion for vehicles and how they 
operate—are active in different automotive forums on the deep web. They offer 
advice, ask questions, discuss problems and bugs found in their vehicles, and 
even share automotive files or links to unofficial software updates.
The information posted in forums by car enthusiasts can be problematic for 
two reasons. The first issue is that malicious threat actors often lurk in these 
forums and take advantage of any reported bugs or problems. The second 
issue is that the files and links posted are untrustworthy and might contain 
malware, spyware, and ransomware, which could void warranties. 
In June 2023, Upstream discovered that a jailbreak for major OEMs' IVI 
systems was available for download on a German car enthusiast blog. The 
blog included detailed guidelines, steps, and a video tutorial on hacking the 
IVI system, as well as examples for possible modifications that can be done 
once jailbroken.

RANSOMWARE ACTORS INCREASINGLY 
TARGET AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIERS 
Malicious actors are increasingly targeting a wide range of automotive and 
mobility stakeholders—including OEMs, suppliers and even EV charging 
infrastructure—with ransomware attacks. Any part of the supply chain can 
pose a risk to OEMs, service providers, or mobility IoT devices. Automotive 
suppliers are highly specialized, meaning switching costs are very high and 
replacement isn't straightforward. 
Operational availability and production 
could be severely affected by ransom 
attacks across the supply chain. 
To extort money, attackers typically maintain a ‘leak site’ on the dark web, 
where they reveal stolen data and sensitive information about organizations, 
and publish posts about their victims. In 2023, ransomware attacks and leak 
sites made the headlines often. The following are just a few notable attacks. 
In June 2023, a leading Taiwan\-based semiconductor manufacturer 
disclosed a cybersecurity incident involving a ransomware group and one 
of its IT hardware suppliers, which led to the leak of information pertinent to 
server initial setup and configuration.224 The attackers claim to have access 
to internal documents with confidential information, demanding a $70 million 
ransom to decrypt the data and prevent its release online —making it the 
largest known ransom demand in history. While the breach could affect 
multiple automotive stakeholders, the company reported that neither its 
business operations nor customer information were affected by the cyber 
incident at its supplier. The company also immediately terminated its data 
exchange with this provider following the incident.
In August 2023, a Dutch Tier\-1 supplier of electromagnets was hit by a 
ransomware attack in which the ransomware group gained unauthorized 
access to the company's systems, disrupting its development and 
sales departments. In response, the company hired leading third\-party 
cybersecurity experts and activated its response protocol, including its 
operational continuity plan.225

Also in August 2023, a Thailand\-based battery manufacturer partnering with 
a German OEM suffered a ransomware attack that resulted in data theft. 
Five samples of documents, showing the victim's projects and information, 
were leaked by the ransomware group, which threatened to publish the stolen 
information if it wasn't paid.226 
Ransom attacks pose a significant risk for fleets, telematics systems, and 
IoT devices. In September 2023, a leading US\-based trucking and fleet 
management solutions provider experienced a ransomware attack that 
resulted in customers being unable to electronically log their on\-road hours—
as required by federal regulations—or track their transported inventory.227
Also in September, one of the UK's largest logistics groups declared 
insolvency following a ransomware attack.228 
THE AUTOMOTIVE AND MOBILITY ECOSYSTEM 
MUST REACT IMMEDIATELY TO THE INCREASE IN 
DEEP AND DARK WEB ACTIVITIES
Data sharing on the deep and dark web has continued to dramatically 
increase during 2023, with automotive\-related security vulnerabilities, 
data breaches of sensitive information, and other cyber threats regularly 
published and discussed. Upstream’s AutoThreat® PRO analysts discovered 
a greater amount of automotive information on deep and dark websites. It 
is necessary to monitor and mitigate these risks regularly to stay ahead of 
threat actors on the deep and dark web—product intelligence and automotive 
expertise are essential for this process. 
These areas of the internet must be monitored by stakeholders to avoid 
serious security gaps. To achieve effective cybersecurity protections, 
organizations and products must know when and in what context they are 
mentioned, both publicly and secretively. The UNECE WP
.29 R155 regulations 
and the ISO/SAE 21434 standard, as well as NHTSA guidelines and the 
regulations in China, require cyber threat intelligence and vulnerability 
monitoring—the deep and dark web must be considered an integral part of 
those requirements.

107
Organizations can improve detection and reduce the mitigation time between 
a discovered vulnerability or security breach, and the time this information 
becomes widely known by continuously monitoring the deep and dark web. 
They can also take preventive measures, such as deploying software patches 
or changing relevant configurations. It's important to minimize the window of 
opportunity criminals have to copy and sell the breached data, and provide 
early warning to automotive stakeholders, employees, key executives, and 
customers of potential exploitation. 
Traditional IT threat intelligence offerings 
lack domain expertise in connected vehicles, 
which presents many challenges for OEMs, 
Tier\-1s and 2s, as well as other mobility 
stakeholders. 
Upstream’s AutoThreat® PRO solution—purpose\-built to overcome these 
challenges—collects, analyzes, and publishes cyber threat intelligence 
specific to the automotive and smart mobility ecosystem, covering the entire 
supply chain, and is tailored to various automotive segments, including 
OEMs, Tier\-1 and 2 suppliers, mobility IoT, connected vehicle service 
providers, insurance companies, and other mobility stakeholders.
Upstream proactively monitors the deep and dark web to uncover emerging 
automotive\-related cyber trends and threat actors. As a result, Upstream 
can identify and mitigate new threats—vulnerabilities, exploits, and fraud 
operations—before they become widely known and spread across the deep 
and dark web.
Armed with the right cyber threat intelligence, automotive and mobility 
stakeholders can proactively implement the necessary cybersecurity 
measures to prevent the next cyber incident.

CYBERSECURITY SOLUTIONS 
CONTINUE TO EVOLVE
Automotive cybersecurity solutions are evolving as the industry continues 
its digital transformation. With cyber threats getting more sophisticated, 
frequent, and large\-scale, cybersecurity solutions have to provide effective 
and rapid remediation across a massive scale of mobility assets and 
ever\-changing SBOM. Vehicle cybersecurity teams and Vehicle Security 
Operations Centers (vSOCs) must also investigate threats that go beyond 
direct attacks on vehicles—targeting fleets, companion applications, mobility 
services, mobility IoT devices, EV charging infrastructure, and more.
The increased connectivity in modern vehicles has opened the door to 
exponential growth in the scale and impact of cyber attacks—posing growing 
cybersecurity challenges for OEMs and their supply chains, and putting trust, 
safety, and operational availability at risk.
Smart mobility stakeholders, OEMs, Tier\-1s, and Tier\-2s will continue to 
place a high priority on cybersecurity as new standards and regulations are 
adopted. To ensure connected cars and mobility services remain secure into 
the future, it's imperative they use a multilayered cybersecurity approach. 
Protecting the vehicle during its entire lifecycle, 
across a complex supply chain and dynamic SBOM
Passenger cars typically last 12 years, commercial trucks 20 years, and 
agricultural vehicles 30 years. OEMs must therefore develop long\-term 
strategies to secure products operating on decades\-old technology. 
UNECE WP.29 R155 and ISO/SAE 21434 establish the requirement 
to consider life\-long cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities during 
development, production, and post\-production phases of the vehicle’s 
lifecycle. OEMs and their suppliers came under regulation and 
standardization for the first time in 2022\. In 2023, OEMs continued to focus 
on two key areas: preparing for the expected growth in scope of monitored 
vehicles with the second milestone of R155 in 2024, and securing connected 
vehicles across complex supply chains with dynamic SBOMs.
2023 marked the second year OEMs have required Tier\-1 and Tier\-2 suppliers 
to disclose their cybersecurity practices, easing concerns about production 
disruptions beyond supply chain bottlenecks. 
© 2024 Upstream Security Ltd. All Rights Reserved
110
By doing so, they have been able to reduce the risk of carrying cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities directly from third\-party vendors onto their vehicles, and 
combat counterfeit components from entering legitimate facilities, 
threatening safety by reducing wear ratings, overriding safety limits, etc.
R155 requires OEMs to implement and maintain threat analysis and risk 
assessment (TARA) throughout all stages of the vehicle lifecycle. They 
must also create processes to address and mitigate against future attacks 
together with their Tier\-1 and Tier\-2 suppliers.
ISO/SAE 21434 can be used as guidance on how to carry out the R155 
requirement together with suppliers. 
Regardless of the method OEMs and suppliers agree on, the OEM bears the 
responsibility to follow R155 \& R156 and implement practices that follow 
ISO/SAE 21434 requirements.
Security by design
One of the four measures explicitly specified by the R155 regulation for 
vehicle cybersecurity is securing vehicles “by design” to mitigate risks along 
the value chain.
Security by design requires evaluating the cybersecurity risks of a component 
or software as early as the development phase. This is done by making 
sure that all vehicle components are designed, developed, and tested for 
cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and that any risks discovered are effectively 
mitigated. 
While OEMs are ultimately responsible for the security of their vehicle, 
all suppliers in the supply chain need to adopt security\-by\-design practices 
as well.
OEMs are responsible for 
checking suppliers’ cyber 
histories and making sure 
suppliers conduct ongoing risk 
and vulnerability management 
for all relevant components.
Cybersecurity responsibilities 
are shared and documented 
using cybersecurity interface 
agreements (CIAs) to ensure that 
nothing is missed due to a lack 
of clarity in delegation. This can 
be done using established project 
management methods such as 
Responsible Approving Supporting 
Informed Consulting (RASIC).

Multi\-layered cybersecurity stack
Multi\-layered security has already become a standard in IT and enterprise 
cybersecurity. Increasingly sophisticated threats and new vulnerabilities are 
constantly emerging, requiring businesses to improve security, and use multiple 
sources of data to detect threats and respond effectively. Enterprises use multiple 
security solutions, including end\-point solutions, network security solutions, cloud 
security, API security, internal segmentation technology, and more. 
In 2019, Gartner standardized the practice by introducing the network\-centric 
concept of the Security Operations Center (SOC) Visibility Triad.229 According to 
Gartner’s research, a modern SOC must rely on three well\-known core security 
elements for increased threat visibility, detection, response, investigation, and 
remediation:

Detection and 
Response 
(EDR)

With the expansion of the Automotive industry into the Smart Mobility 
ecosystem, vehicles are not the sole mobility assets that challenge cyber 
teams. Applying a SOC approach to the vSOC creates a more secure layering 
between OEMs, Tier\-1s, Telematics Service Providers (TSPs), and other 
stakeholders in the ecosystem, minimizing threats and preventing attacks. In 
addition to IT network security, which protects OEM servers and IT backend 
infrastructure from cyber attacks, the vSOC adds a new layer of protection, 
focusing on Vehicle Detection and Response (V\-XDR): 
There are unique cybersecurity challenges associated with each layer in the 
automotive infrastructure. These challenges can be addressed with a multi\-
layered approach, which includes a V\-XDR and a purpose\-built vSOC.
API security
This new addition to the vSOC is a cross\-functional 
effort between the vSOC and the IT SOC, focusing 
on protecting API\-based applications, services, 
and features. 
Automotive cloud security
Leverage the automotive cloud to expand detection 
to a wide range of mobility assets and cyber threats 
including vehicle telematics, OTA updates, remote 
commands and diagnostics, etc.; identify multi\-vehicle 
attacks with a fleet\-wide view of security across 
vehicles, applications, and other connected services.
Vehicle security
Monitor and protect internal vehicle components, 
including ECUs, diagnostics, DTC data streams, OS logs, 
CAN events, etc.

DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE VSOC
SOCs are routinely used to monitor IT systems, infrastructure, and assets 
at large organizations, including OEMS. But unlike IT infrastructure, which 
is directly managed by OEMs, vehicles are constantly in motion, not directly 
under the control of OEMs, and interact with external systems and applications 
thousands of times a minute. 
As the number and sophistication of cyber attacks targeting vehicles, mobility 
applications, OT and IoT mobility devices increase, OEMs must develop integrated 
vSOCs, also known as “mobility SOCs” or “automotive SOCs”, to protect their 
vehicles, infrastructure, and customers during the post\-production phase.
An effective vSOC is essential for the security of connected vehicles and Smart 
Mobility ecosystems. It allows OEMs to monitor their entire infrastructure and 
vehicles in real\-time, and respond to detected threats quickly.
However, with the constant expansion and digital transformation of the Smart 
Mobility ecosystem, more stakeholders are expected to require a vSOC. Mobility 
IoT vendors, fleet systems, and other smart mobility service providers will shift 
to monitoring and protecting their assets via a vSOC. 
When implemented properly, an effective vSOC has a clear framework—detailing 
capabilities, components, and operating models—and a well\-defined strategy 
and scope—including a vision, mission, and charter.
An effective vSOC should also:
Operate 24/7
Ingest data from various automotive\-related feeds and 
correlate between those various feeds
Detect threats and anomalies in near or real\-time using 
automotive\-specific cybersecurity analytics
Triage and investigate alerts
Predict threats before they emerge by leveraging purple teams, 
threat models, and threat intelligence fusion
Conduct proactive threat hunting
Outline governance and steering policies, standards, procedures, 
and processes
Build and implement end\-to\-end playbooks to structure and 
automate response activities
Integrate with SIEM and SOAR platforms to ensure 
cross\-organizational visibility and effective remediation

COMBINE
CREATE
CONTRACT
Existing enterprise SOCs 
can be expanded to include 
mobility assets, which 
would require adding OT 
expertise, specific platforms, 
and changing operating 
procedures.
Those who are just starting 
their vSOC journey can create 
a new dedicated vSOC, 
building a dedicated team, 
processes and playbooks.
The vSOC can be outsourced 
to a Managed Security Service 
Provider (MSSP) with both 
IT and automotive\-related 
cybersecurity capabilities.
During 2023, many OEMs continued to focus on their vSOC implementation 
journey, based on the understanding that vSOCs are critical for effective 
mitigation and response. The scope of monitored vehicles for regulatory 
purposes is expected to grow significantly with the second milestone of R155 
in July 2024\. OEMs must ensure their vSOC teams, platforms, and processes 
are adjusted accordingly.
The next generation of vSOCs
OEMs are continuously working on solidifying vSOCs and positioning them 
internally. They are defining vSOC scope, deciding where it belongs in the 
organizational structure, and evaluating sourcing (e.g., in\-house, hybrid 
or managed vSOC) and operating models (e.g., one global vSOC, multiple 
geographies presence, etc.).
OEMs must establish vSOCs as soon as possible to comply with R155\. There 
are several options for vSOC implementation:
Mostly “pure” / standalone vSOCs
Focused strictly on post\-production connected vehicles 
and driven by regulatory requirements and compliance
Part of the IT organization; reporting to the CISO; 
sometimes part of after\-sales or global operations
Sometimes also focused on IT aspects of the connected 
vehicles infrastructure—the automotive cloud
vSOCs can be built in three ways:

115
Some OEMs, however, have already reached a higher level of vSOC maturity. 
Two new types of vSOCs are emerging in response to the growth in scale and 
maturing vSOC processes \& knowledge:
The vast majority of operational connected vehicle data is owned and 
managed by OEMs. As we look into the future, we see a dramatic shift in the 
need for more stakeholders to have access to connected vehicle data.
Smart mobility stakeholders such as fleet owners and operators, mobility 
service providers, state governments, local municipalities, and others may 
need to establish their own independent vSOCs with completely different 
business objectives than those run by OEMs.
that combines the IT SOC and the vSOC 
into a single entity that manages a broad 
security operations center, covering security 
elements of the entire vehicle lifecycle—
from design to manufacturing (e.g., OT 
monitoring of vehicle production) and 
operations.
within a broader connected vehicle 
operations center, including cross\-
functional approach combining the basic 
vSOC functions together with OTA health 
monitoring, DTC monitoring, cyber, etc. The 
fusion vSOC requires close collaboration

OEM \& SMART MOBILITY APPLICATIONS 
REQUIRE EXPANDED FUSION DETECTION—
EXTENDING COVERAGE BEYOND OWASP TOP 10
In practice, API hacking at the entry level is relatively standardized, requires 
lower technical expertise, and can be done remotely without special 
hardware—making it more cost\-effective to hack than other types of systems.
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) API Security Top 10230 
serves as an IT industry standard to help developers and security teams 
understand API risks and is updated as threats evolve. 
Updated in 2023, the top 10 list includes:
The updated OWASP API Top 10 risk list underscores the evolving threat 
landscape and the crucial need for vigilance and proactive cybersecurity 
measures. The impact of API\-based attacks is felt in service disruptions, vehicle 
and driver safety, data breaches, and privacy, fraudulent activities aimed to 
bypass subscriptions and feature limitations, as well as brand reputation.

But in the context of Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystems, IT\-based 
API security like OWASP, is not enough. IT\-based security solutions focus on 
transactions, permissions, volumes, values, and payload correctness—often 
ignoring the contextual state of mobility assets, their physical behavior on 
the road and safety impact. 
In addition to API traffic, extended detection should consider additional 
data sources, such as telematics data. By combining these two sources of 
information, organizations can gain a deeper understanding of potential 
threats and vulnerabilities. 
API security requires a holistic view, contextualizing operational data and API 
traffic to reflect the state of vehicles, applications, and consumers. A variety 
of data sources can be leveraged alongside API traffic and documentation to 
identify anomalies that indicate a threat to operational systems:
Vehicle, user, and device location
User and vehicle identification numbers
Vehicle telematics
Billing and login history
Charging station protocols
Mobility stakeholders are evaluating the responsibilities related to monitoring 
and detecting API\-based cybersecurity risks. Such risks can either be 
analyzed under the enterprise SOC, the vSOC, or a new IT\-OT SOC.
