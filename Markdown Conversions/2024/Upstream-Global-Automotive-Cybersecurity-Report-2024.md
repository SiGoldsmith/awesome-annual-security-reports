It is my pleasure to present you with the 2024 Global Automotive Cybersecurity Report.
Connectivity and software-defined architectures have been at the forefront of monumental 
changes in the Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem over the past several years, but as more 
functionality is being exposed, cybersecurity risks ‌
are growing dramatically.
This report, which marks Upstream’s sixth annual report, analyzes how Automotive and Mobility 
cybersecurity risks have evolved from experimental hacks to large-scale attacks, shifting the 
industry's focus to impact.
As predicted last year, automotive cybersecurity is reaching an inflection point. Cyber incidents have 
grown significantly in risk and impact, threatening safety and carrying operational implications. With 
threat actor motivation shifting towards large-scale impact on mobility assets, stakeholders across 
the ecosystem must also evaluate the potential financial implications of cybersecurity incidents.
Over the last year, the Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem adopted new standards and 
collaborated with regulators around the world on how to adapt future regulations to keep connected 
and software-defined assets secure. We’ve also been busy preparing for the upcoming second 
milestone of UNECE WP
.29 R155, scheduled to take effect in July 2024, increasing its scope to all 
new vehicles.
2023 was the year of the GenAI revolution. GenAI is increasingly used by threat actors to introduce 
scale and new attack methods. But, in the coming months and years GenAI will also transform 
automotive cybersecurity tools and workflows and introduce unprecedented efficiencies to vSOC 
teams.
This inflection point illustrates the progress that adversaries continue to make, and reaffirms 
our commitment as an industry to continually innovate and deliver secure automotive and smart 
mobility experiences.
Upstream has led the effort to secure connected vehicles and mobility assets since 2017, when we 
first introduced the Upstream Platform, which proved to be a fundamental, innovative pillar in the 
automotive cybersecurity technology stack.
We've been helping some of the world's leading Automotive and Smart Mobility organizations—
OEMs, suppliers, mobility IoT vendors, fleets and mobility service providers—comply with 
cybersecurity regulations and protect millions of vehicles and mobility assets. 
With advanced cybersecurity tools and knowledge at our disposal, we are well-equipped to 
overcome the challenges in 2024 and ahead.
Best regards,
Yoav Levy

## METHODOLOGY
The Automotive industry relies on Upstream's continuously updated database of 
cybersecurity incidents.
To compile this comprehensive report, Upstream researchers investigated over 
1468 incidents, some as early as 2010, and monitored hundreds of deep and dark 
web forums to compile this comprehensive, actionable report that will help you safely 
navigate the year ahead. 
Upstream monitors and analyzes worldwide automotive cyber incidents to learn, 
understand, and help protect the entire Smart Mobility ecosystem from existing and 
emerging threats.
Upstream’s AutoThreat®[^1] cyber threat intelligence platform uses advanced technology 
and automation tools to constantly search all layers of the web for new cyber incidents 
in the automotive ecosystem and index them to the AutoThreat® platform. 
Our researchers and analysts carefully categorize and analyze the data we collect to 
gain a deeper understanding of cyber threats, adversaries' motivation and activities, 
and their impact on mobility assets.
Each incident and relevant contextual data—such as the attack's geolocation, impact, 
attack vector, company type, and required proximity of the attacker to its target—are 
added to the platform to create an accurate and actionable repository. 
Incidents examined in this report were sourced from the media, academic research, 
bug bounty programs, verified social media accounts of government law enforcement 
agencies worldwide, the Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures database, as well as 
other publicly-available online sources. 
In addition to publicly reported cyber incidents, Upstream’s analysts monitor the deep 
and dark web for threat actors that operate behind the scenes of automotive-focused 
cyber attacks. These incidents are discussed in a separate chapter of this report titled 
"Threats from the Deep and Dark Web", and are excluded from statistics and charts in 
other chapters, unless indicated otherwise.
While every effort has been made to identify and analyze every reported automotive 
and smart mobility cyber incident, there may be additional attacks that have not been 
publicly reported, and therefore, have not been included in this report.
Select details of the publicly reported incidents are available in the AutoThreat® 
Intelligence Cyber Incident Repository. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis is 
available to AutoThreat® PRO[^2] customers.

2023 MARKS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW  
ERA IN AUTOMOTIVE CYBERSECURITY
Connectivity has been at the forefront of monumental changes in the 
Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem over the past several years—
enabling over-the-air (OTA) updates, software-oriented architectures, advanced 
digital experience, and a wide array of value-added applications and services.
In modern software-defined vehicles (SDVs), connectivity is used to improve 
and upgrade vehicles throughout their life cycle, generate revenue from a wide 
range of feature-on-demand services, and offer innovative data-driven customer 
experience, ultimately creating deeper and longer relationships with customers.
In connected vehicles, OEMs use OTA updates to fix quality and usability 
issues, tune core functional capabilities, and patch cybersecurity vulnerabilities 
quickly and cost-effectively, reducing warranty costs and recalls.
But connectivity has also posed growing cybersecurity challenges for OEMs 
and their supply chains—with cyber attacks becoming more sophisticated, 
frequent, and severe. As the attack landscape changed over the last few years, 
and new attack methods emerged, the industry became acutely aware that any 
point of connectivity can be attacked.
The first decade of automotive cybersecurity was marked by a rise in cyber 
incidents and attacks against OEMs and the ecosystem, continuously 
introducing new attack vectors and methods, even as OEMs invested in 
improving cybersecurity protections. According to Upstream’s research, between 
2019-2023, incidents disclosed in the clear web (media) have increased by over 
50%, reaching 295 reported incidents in 2023.  In 2023 alone, 95% of attacks 
were remote, and 64% of attacks were executed by black hat actors.[^3] 
Application programming interfaces (APIs) have been playing a key role in 
exposing vehicle functionality to drivers and enterprise applications, as well as 
delivering a data-driven experience. As more functionality has been exposed 
through APIs, cybersecurity risks have also increased dramatically, while at 
the same time, the cost of attacking and attack thresholds have decreased—
opening the door for exponential growth in the scale and impact of attacks.
In this year’s report, we chose to zoom  
in on the impact of automotive and  
mobility cybersecurity risks.

We’ll focus on both external impact, which is visible to the ecosystem, and 
internal impact which refers to organizational efficiencies and processes. 
Both internal and external impacts are assessed by different stakeholders in 
different ways—in this report we’ll offer a framework which can be customized for 
each stakeholder’s strategic goals, target market, relevant mobility assets, etc.
External impact can be objectively 
measured in two dimensions:  
scale and cost. 
We’ll showcase how advanced connectivity and software-defined architectures 
continuously introduce new cybersecurity risks, attracting executives' attention 
across the entire ecosystem due to the potential impact on the safety of 
drivers, passengers and the integrity of data at massive scale, leading to 
astounding financial losses. 
With social media becoming a major platform for consumers and professionals, 
threat actors are using social media to exchange knowledge with the potential 
to reach millions of people around the world in a matter of minutes. Based 
on its viral potential, social media has become one of the top distribution 
channels for malicious activities, both criminal and fraudulent, and should be 
considered when analyzing external impact and scale. 
As vehicles continue to evolve well after they leave the manufacturing 
floor based on continuous over-the-air updates (OTAs), we’ll also discuss 
the internal impact of cybersecurity risks on internal processes and risk 
evaluations that drive automotive stakeholders to adopt new frameworks and 
remediation processes.

Analyzing the potential scale of automotive cyber risks
Automotive cybersecurity threats have evolved rapidly in a very short span 
of time. In 2015, Charlie Miller spent three years—from research to exploit—
to hack the safety-critical in-vehicle network of a single vehicle.[^4] In 2023, 
a team of security researchers spent a mere few months hacking over a 
dozen different car makers. The team hacked telematic systems, automotive 
APIs, and the infrastructure that supports them. They discovered numerous 
vulnerabilities that allowed them to remotely impact the command & control 
of vehicles and access sensitive OEM and consumer data.[^5]
In 2023, automotive cybersecurity 
witnessed a dramatic shift  
toward large-scale incidents.

It’s important to note that when analyzing scale, the focus is on potential 
impact. It is impossible to assess the exact impact of each incident based on 
publicly reported information. 
Upstream analyzed publicly disclosed automotive cybersecurity incidents 
between 2021 and 2023 according to the potential scale of impacted mobility 
assets, including vehicles, users, mobility devices and more. Upstream’s 
analysis categorized incidents according to four levels of impact—starting 
from “Low”, which includes incidents that have the potential to impact under 
10 assets, up to “Massive”, which includes incidents that have the potential to 
impact millions of mobility assets.

During both 2021 and 2022, “High” or “Massive” (potential to impact thousands-
million of mobility assets) incidents accounted for approximately 20% of total 
incidents. But, in 2023, the proportion of incidents with a “High” or “Massive” 
impact dramatically doubled to nearly 50%.
Overall, the number of "Medium" scale attacks, which have the potential to 
impact up to 1,000 vehicles and mobility assets, has remained constant over 
the last three years. But the number of low-scale attacks has gone down 
dramatically in 2023 due to the emergence of new attack vectors that enable 
hackers to gain control over many more vehicles and assets with lower 
thresholds of knowledge and resources. 
To illustrate the operational disruption impact of cyber attacks on mobility 
service providers consider an attack which occurred in September 2023. 
A leading US-based trucking and fleet management solutions provider 
experienced a ransomware attack that resulted in customers being unable to 
electronically log their on-road hours—as required by federal regulations—or 
track their transported inventory.[^6]
In response, the company hired external cybersecurity experts to investigate 
the attack and applied for a waiver from the US Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration to allow truckers to use paper logs until ‌
service was restored.[^7] 
Almost three weeks passed before the 
company was able to resolve the issue, 
causing serious operational disruption for 
thousands of truck drivers, fleet operators, 
and inventory management teams.

THREAT ACTORS MOTIVATION  
HAS ALSO SHIFTED TOWARDS  
SCALE AND MASSIVE IMPACT
In addition to incidents disclosed in the media (clear web), 
it’s critical to assess the impact of deep and dark cyber 
activities and the incentives driving threat actors. Based 
on Upstream’s analysis of deep and dark web automotive 
cybersecurity activities, analyzing the 300 most active threat 
actors, nearly half of the activities (48%) were targeting 
more than one OEM or automotive supplier, and 37% 
had the potential to impact mobility assets across many 
stakeholders on a global scale.
In 2023, nearly 65% of deep and 
dark web cyber activities had the 
potential to impact thousands to 
millions of mobility assets.

When zooming in on black hat and fraud activities 
in the deep and dark web, the potential scale and 
areas of interest also indicate a rapidly growing 
risk. Currently, 67% of malicious activities (threat 
actors categorized as black hats and fraud 
operators) have a “High” or “Massive” impact 
(compared to 45% across all actors) and 58% of 
activities involve multiple OEMs or have a global 
reach (compared to 48% across all threat actors). 
When analyzing the 
areas of interest, the 
impact of black hats 
and fraud operators 
continues to deepen.
13% of activities are focused on vehicle 
manipulation tools, 12% of activities are focused 
on gaining access to sensitive data and PII, and 
nearly 50% are related  to vulnerability exploits.[^8]

THE RISING COST OF CYBER ATTACKS ON THE 
AUTOMOTIVE AND SMART MOBILITY ECOSYSTEM 
Automotive and Smart Mobility cyber attacks have severe financial 
repercussions leading to recalls or OTAs, production shutdowns, ransomware 
payments, and vehicle thefts. Additional repercussions include data and 
privacy breaches, which can damage a brand's reputation and customer trust 
and can eventually lead to large regulatory fines and diminishing revenue. 
Given the shift toward large-scale cybersecurity incidents—with nearly 50% 
of incidents in 2023 impacting thousands-millions of mobility assets[^9]—it’s 
crucial for vehicle security operations center (vSOC) teams to analyze the 
financial impact of these incidents.
In June 2023, a leading Taiwan-based semiconductor manufacturer 
disclosed a cybersecurity incident involving a ransomware group and one of 
its IT hardware suppliers, which ‌
led to the leakage of information pertinent to 
initial setup and configuration of the system.[^10] The attackers claimed to gain 
access to internal documents with confidential information, demanding a $70 
million ransom to decrypt the data and prevent its release online—making it 
the largest known ransom demand in history. While the breach could affect 
multiple automotive stakeholders, the company reported that neither its 
business operations nor customer information were affected by the cyber 
incident at its supplier. The company also immediately terminated its data 
exchange with this supplier following the incident.
In November 2023, a large Australian automotive group with 12 dealerships 
and hundreds of employees was attacked by the same ransomware group, 
who stole more than 50 GB of sensitive customer and internal data. Over 
91,000 files were stolen, including payroll information, lease agreements, 
payout information, service quotes, invoices, crash assistance forms, CRM 
data, registration paperwork, and employee driver and motor vehicle sales 
licenses. The stolen files were published at the end of November, after the 
ransom deadline had expired.[^11] 
IN JUNE 2023, 
A TIER-2 WAS  
HIT BY A  
$70  
MILLION 
RANSOM DEMAND, 
THE LARGEST  
IN HISTORY.

THE FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE
17
© 2024 Upstream Security Ltd. All Rights Reserved
Analyzing the financial impact of a cybersecurity incident
Trying to quantify the safety, privacy, and financial risks of automotive 
cybersecurity incidents is no small feat. The potential impact of automotive 
cyber threats is significant and can pose risks to the safety of drivers and 
passengers, disrupt business operations, compromise data privacy, and 
result in financial losses for OEMs as well as the entire supply chain. 
In the next two illustrations we will analyze two incidents that occurred in 2023 
and suggest a financial impact model, based on publicly available information. 
The goal of this framework is to  
highlight the massive financial  
impact of cybersecurity risks. 
This analysis doesn’t intend to be definitive, but rather a framework for 
estimating a range of potential financial risks.

 ILLUSTRATION #1
Financial impact of an EV fleet-wide vulnerability 
In March 2023, a team of French security researchers participating in a hacking contest demonstrated 
an exploit that involved executing what is known as a time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) attack 
on an EV OEM’s gateway energy management system that allowed them to remotely perform actions 
(e.g., open the front trunk or door) while the car was in motion.[^12]
Despite the OEM's claims that this was not possible, the researchers claimed they could have 
remotely gained access to vehicle controls. The researchers were rewarded by the OEM with an EV 
and $100,000 in cash, and reported that the OEM is working on making software patches for the 
vulnerability and the updates should be pushed to cars soon.
