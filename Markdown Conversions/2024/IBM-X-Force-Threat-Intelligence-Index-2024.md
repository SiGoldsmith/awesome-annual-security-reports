Executive summary

The biggest shift the IBM® X\-Force® team 
observed in 2023 was a pronounced 
surge in cyberthreats targeting identities. 
Attackers have a historical inclination 
to choose the path of least resistance 
in pursuit of their objectives. In this era, 
the focus has shifted towards logging in 
rather than hacking in, highlighting the 
relative ease of acquiring credentials 
compared to exploiting vulnerabilities or 
executing phishing campaigns. Lack of 
identity protections was corroborated by 
IBM X\-Force penetration testing data for 
2023, which ranked identification and 
authentication failures as the second most 
common finding. 

Additionally, X\-Force observed a 100% 
increase in “Kerberoasting" during incident 
response engagements. Kerberoasting 
is a technique focused on compromising 
Microsoft Windows Active Directory 
credentials through Kerberos tickets. 
This indicates a technique shift in how 
attackers are acquiring identities to carry 
out their operations. 

The prominence of valid accounts as a 
preferred initial access technique among 
cybercriminals—tying with phishing 
for the first time—was another notable 
development. This access technique is 
accompanied by an upsurge in malware

designed to steal information, known 
as infostealer malware, activities that 
bolster the dark web’s stolen credentials 
marketplace. This multifaceted shift 
underscores the symbiotic relationship 
among various elements in the 
cybercrime ecosystem.

It’s clear that attackers have recognized the 
difficulty defenders have in distinguishing 
between legitimate identity use and 
unauthorized misuse. This escalation in 
targeting of identities in cyberattacks 
underscores the critical importance for 
organizations to proactively identify, 
eliminate and audit potential attack vectors 
within their dynamic networks. These 
measures are pivotal in reducing 

the attack surface, unveiling latent risks 
and autonomously remediating incidents 
that are independent of impending threats.

Last year will also go down in history as a 
generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) 
breakout year. Policy makers, business 
executives and cybersecurity professionals 
are all feeling the pressure to adopt AI 
within their operations. And the rush to 
adopt gen AI is currently outpacing the 
industry’s ability to understand the security 
risks these new capabilities will introduce. 
However, a universal AI attack surface will 
materialize once adoption of AI reaches 
a critical mass, forcing organizations to 
prioritize security defenses that can adapt 
to AI threats at scale.

In an attempt to identify key milestones 
that will indicate when a common AI threat 
landscape will mature, X\-Force assessed 
previous technology disrupters and their 
threat maturity milestones. Based on the 
analysis, X\-Force predicts threat actors will 
begin to target AI broadly once the market 
coalesces around common deployment 
models and a small number of vendors. 
This analysis suggests that AI market 
dominance is the milestone that will trigger 
attacker investment in attack toolkits 
targeting AI.

Despite looming gen AI\-enabled threats, 
X\-Force hasn’t observed any concrete 
evidence of generative AI\-engineered 
cyberattacks to date or a rapid shift in 
attackers’ goals and objectives from 

previous years. Although X\-Force observed 
a notable drop in ransomware attacks 
on enterprises in 2023, extortion\-based 
attacks continue to be a driving force of 
cybercrime this past year. These extortion\-
based attacks were only surpassed by data 
theft and leak as the most common impact 
observed in X\-Force incident response 
engagements globally. 

The IBM X\-Force Threat Intelligence Index 
offers these insights as a resource to IBM 
clients, researchers in the security industry, 
policy makers, the media and the broader 
community of security professionals and 
business leaders. It’s our intent to keep 
all parties informed of the current threat 
landscape so they can make the best 
decisions for reducing risk.

Drop in enterprise ransomware 
incidents

Despite remaining the most common action on objective (20%), 
X\-Force observed a drop in enterprise ransomware incidents. This 
drop is likely to impact adversaries’ revenue expectations from 
encryption\-based extortion as larger organizations are stopping 
attacks before ransomware is deployed and opting against paying 
and decrypting in favor of rebuilding if ransomware takes hold.

Percentage of data theft and

Upsurge in use of infostealers 
X\-Force has observed threat groups 
who have previously specialized in

infostealers. And a number of prominent 
new infostealers recently debuted and 
demonstrated increased activity in 2023, 
such as Rhadamanthys, LummaC2 
and StrelaStealer. 

Share of security misconfigurations 
among web application vulnerabilities 
identified
X\-Force penetration testing engagements 
revealed that the most observed web 
application risk across client environments 
globally was security misconfigurations. Of 
these misconfigurations, the top offenses 
included allowing concurrent user sessions 
in the application, which could weaken 
multifactor authentication (MFA) through 
session hijacking.

Nearly one\-third of incidents that X\-Force 
responded to were cases where legitimate 
tools were used for malicious purposes, 
such as credential theft, reconnaissance, 
remote access or data exfiltration.

Market share threshold likely to trigger 
attacks against AI platforms
X\-Force analysis indicates that the 
establishment of AI market dominance 
will signal AI attack surface maturity. This 
analysis suggests that once a single AI 
technology approaches 50% market share, 
or when the market consolidates to three 
or less technologies, the cybercriminal 
ecosystem will be incentivized to invest in 
developing tools and attack paths targeting 
AI technologies.

Top initial access vectors

One of the top initial access vectors in 
2023—jumping from third to first place—
was the abuse of valid accounts identified 
in 30% of the observed incidents X\-Force 
responded to. As defenders increase their 
detection and prevention capabilities, 
attackers are finding that obtaining 
valid credentials is an easier route to 
achieving their goals, considering the 
alarming volume of compromised yet 
valid credentials available—and easily 
accessible—on the dark web. X\-Force found 
that cloud account credentials alone make 
up 90% of for sale cloud assets on the dark 
web, making it easy for threat actors to take 
over legitimate user identities to establish 
access into victim environments. Attacker 
use of valid accounts as an initial access 
vector appears to have a significant impact 
on the required response efforts, as well.

Top initial access vectors

In 2023, major incidents where the attacker 
leveraged a valid account for initial access 
were associated with more complex response 
measures by defenders—190% greater than the 
average incident.

As we will analyze further in the report, we 
identified a concerning trend in the rise of 
infostealers and ransomware groups pivoting 
to infostealing malware. These shifts suggest 
that threat actors have revalued credentials as 
a reliable and preferred initial access vector. As 
threat actors invest in infostealers to grow their 
credential repository, enterprises are pushed 
into a new defense landscape where identity can 
no longer be guaranteed.

Phishing, whether through an attachment, link or 
as a service, also comprised 30% of all incidents 
remediated by X\-Force in 2023\. Although tied 

for first place in 2023, the volume of 
phishing is down by 44% from 2022\. 

The significant drop in observed 
compromises through phishing is likely 
a reflection of both continued adoption 
and revaluation of phishing mitigation 
techniques and strategies, as well as 
attackers shifting to the use of valid 
credentials to gain initial access. Using 
compromised valid credentials is a quick, 
direct route into the environment. Whereas 
IBM X\-Force Red data indicates that 
human\-crafted phishing emails are time\-
intensive, requiring on average 16 hours to 
craft one. However, it’s worth noting that 
X\-Force assesses that phishing is expected 
to be one of the first malicious use cases 
of AI that cybercriminals will invest in, 
theorizing that it’s far from done scaling. 

In fact, X\-Force data shows that AI can 
generate a deceptive phish in 5 minutes, a 
potential time savings of nearly 2 days for 
attackers. 

Furthermore, X\-Force responded 
to multiple cases involving email 
compromises that circumvented MFA 
measures using adversary\-in\-the\-middle 
(AitM) attacks. These attacks started with 
an initial phishing message that directed 
users to a reverse\-proxy phishing page, 
which allowed attackers to relay traffic 
between the user and the legitimate site 
and thus collect user credentials, MFA input 
and session cookies. In multiple cases, 
X\-Force observed the threat actor leverage 
their initial access to carry out both internal 
and external phishing attempts, as well 
as further abuse of credentials, to access 
additional applications.

Top initial access vectors

In third place, exploitation of public\-facing 
applications—defined as adversaries taking 
advantage of a weakness in an internet\-
facing computer or program—was identified 
in 29% of incidents, which is slightly higher 
than what we observed in 2022\. 

In 2023, numerous organizations 
experienced cyberattacks as a result of 
widespread exploitation of managed file 
transfer (MFT) tools, such as MOVEit and 
GoAnywhere. MFT exploitation poses a 
high risk, as these internet\-connected file 
transfer services facilitate the immediate 
access of sensitive enterprise data by 
attackers. Until 2023, many defenders 
overlooked the high\-risk nature of MFT 
tools, leading to inadequately protected 

deployments without proper detection 
and response strategies. This lack of 
consideration provided threat actors with 
a significant time advantage, allowing 
them to scale their attacks undetected. 
Last year’s mass exploitation of MFTs, and 
the ongoing efforts of ransomware groups 
focusing on data extortion, underscore the 
need for organizations to fully understand 
their enterprise architecture. To facilitate 
this understanding, organizations should 
develop threat models that map out their 
systems and the associated attack paths to 
their sensitive data stored on premises, in 
the cloud, or through third parties.

Security misconfigurations top web 
application risk

New to the 2024 IBM X\-Force Threat 
Intelligence Index, X\-Force reviewed 
hundreds of findings from our penetration 
testing data to reveal the top Open 
Worldwide Application Security Project 
(OWASP) web application security risks. 
The most observed risk across client 
environments globally was security 
misconfigurations, accounting for 
30% of total findings. Of this category, 
penetration testers found more than 
140 findings of ways that attackers 
can exploit misconfigurations. Of these 
misconfigurations, the top offenses 
included allowing concurrent user sessions 
in the application at 15%, which could 
weaken MFA through session hijacking, 
verbose error messages at 12% and 
excessive session timeouts at 8%.

In second place, identification and 
authentication failures made up 21% of the 
most observed web application security 
risks. Of these findings, the top offenses 
were weak password policies that included 
Active Directory password policies (19%), 
usernames verifiable through errors (17%), 
Server Message Block (SMB) signing not 
required and URLs containing sensitive 
information at 8% each.

Zero\-day decline 

Every year there are a few vulnerabilities 
that catch enterprises by surprise and 
cause widespread damage. In 2023, 
the CL0P ransomware group exploited a 
vulnerability in the file transfer application 
MOVEit, common vulnerabilities and 
exposures (CVE)\-2023\-34362, to expose 
information on millions of individuals.

Top initial access vectors

While zero\-day vulnerabilities garner notoriety, 
the reality is that zero\-day vulnerabilities make 
up a very small percentage of the vulnerability 
attack surface—currently at 3% of total 
vulnerabilities tracked by X\-Force. In 2023, 
there was a 72% drop in the number of zero 
days compared to 2022 with only 172 new 
zero\-day vulnerabilities. Furthermore, from 
2021 to 2022, there was a 44% decrease of 
new zero\-day vulnerabilities, from 1,105 CVEs 
added in 2021 to 614 CVEs added in 2022\. 
This decrease is likely indicative of attackers 
finding other less resource\-intensive methods 
to gain entry, such as exploitation of older 
vulnerabilities or use of valid credentials, 
compromised or purchased.

Linux vulnerabilities

The importance of securing Linux® systems 
has risen in prominence as increasing 
amounts of malicious activity targeting 
Linux have appeared. Malware developers 
are increasingly developing Linux malware 
and creating Linux variants of existing 
malware families. These changes to 
the Linux threat landscape highlight 
the criticality of systems hardening and 
monitoring for malicious activity. 

Methodical vulnerability management is a 
key aspect of proactive defense. According 
to Red Hat® Insights vulnerability data 
from 2023, 92% of customers were found 
to have at least one CVE with known 
exploits in their environment at the time 
of scanning. Furthermore, 81% had three 
or more CVEs with known exploits in their 
environment. More than half (67%) had 

at least one CVE rated as Critical, while 
25% had five or more Critical CVEs in their 
environment. Additionally, the majority 
(80%) of the top ten vulnerabilities with 
the highest number of hits detected across 
systems in 2023 were given a High or 
Critical Common Vulnerability Scoring 
System (CVSS) base severity score.

Most threat activity targeting Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux systems in 2023 was 
associated with widely distributed threats. 
According to statistics from the Red Hat 
Insights malware detection service, the 
top threats detected were Linux rootkits, 
malware associated with the recently 
dismantled IPStorm botnet, which enabled 
proxying of malicious traffic through 
compromised devices, and the PGMiner 
cryptocurrency mining botnet.

Top actions on objectives

According to IBM X\-Force Incident 
Response data, deployment of malware 
was the most common action threat 
actors took on victim networks, occurring 
in 43% of all reported incidents. Of the 
total incidents, 20% were ransomware 
cases. Backdoors and crypto miners 
were discovered in 6% and 5% of cases, 
respectively. The remaining malware 
incidents included infostealers, loaders, 
bots, worms, web shells and downloaders.

Top actions on objectives

This year, X\-Force also reviewed cases 
to identify where legitimate tools were 
used for malicious purposes, which was 
observed in 32% of cases. For example, 
X\-Force has observed vulnerability 
scanners used to conduct reconnaissance 
or adversary simulation tools to exfiltrate 
data. These tools were used to perform 
credential theft in 13% of total cases, 
followed by data exfiltration (11%), remote 
access (10%) and reconnaissance (6%).

Ransomware

Although X\-Force responded to less 
ransomware cases in 2023, down 
11\.5% year over year, ransomware and 
ransomware\-affiliated groups continued to 
target organizations globally, with multiple 
variants receiving upgrades to expand 
their targeting and functionality. The top 
ransomware variants observed by X\-Force 
were BlackCat, CL0P, LockBit, BlackBasta 
and Royal. 

In 2022, ransomware was topped slightly 
by backdoors as the top attack X\-Force 
responded to after dominating the IBM 
X\-Force Incident Response activity since 
2018\. In 2023, although ransomware 
moved back to the top action on objective, 
X\-Force observed a continued reduction in 
ransomware incident response activity. 

However, analysis of ransomware extortion 
sites indicate ransomware activity globally has 
increased in 2023\. The contradictory data points 
appear to be attributed to similar data presented 
in last year’s IBM X\-Force Threat Intelligence 
Index. X\-Force clients have continued to 
improve their capabilities to detect and respond 
to the precursors of a ransomware event, 
backdoors, lateral movement and identity abuse. 

For instance, X\-Force responded to several 
cases involving Qakbot and other types of 
infections that were caught before ransomware 
would have likely been deployed. In addition, as 
we’ll indicate in the next section, data theft and 
leaks remain the top impacts observed across 
IBM X\-Force Incident Response engagements.

Next chapter

04

Top actions on objectives

These observations suggest that threat actors 
are no longer limiting themselves to ransomware 
attacks to commit extortion. They’re looking at 
other attack types to deliver on their objectives. 
For example, X\-Force responded to multiple 
incidents associated with the CL0P ransomware 
group’s widespread data extortion attacks 
through MOVEit exploitation.

Although the names of the most prominent 
ransomware operations continued to shift, 
X\-Force uncovered new evidence linking many 
current families to past operations. While the 
Conti ransomware group—tracked by X\-Force as 
ITG23—famously shut down in 2022, X\-Force 
found evidence indicating connections to new 
ransomware projects. These new projects 
included Quantum, Royal, Zeon and BlackBasta 
ransomware, as well as the Karakurt data 
extortion group. 

These operations also appear to share 
many of the same connections to initial 
access malware distribution groups, such 
as IcedID, Emotet, Bumblebee, Qakbot and 
Gozi. X\-Force also discovered a campaign 
likely undertaken by former members of 
the Conti ransomware group that leveraged 
a false claim of successful data theft as 
lure material. As such, the criminal core 
behind ITG23 is still prominent on the 
cybercriminal threat landscape. 

Ransomware operations that maintained 
their branding upgraded their operations, 
demonstrating resiliency. BlackCat 
developers, for instance, debuted a new 
variant of the malware dubbed Sphynx in 
early 2023, which introduced a number of 
new capabilities to make the ransomware 
more difficult to detect. Affiliates also 

have been observed evolving their tactics, 
techniques and procedures (TTPs) across 
the attack chain, including using a QR 
code for victims to access the ransom 
note. Additionally, ransomware operators 
continue to develop Linux versions of their 
ransomware. In 2023, new Linux variants 
of ransomware families were introduced, 
including CL0P and Royal.

Ransomware attack timelines

X\-Force performed an analysis of 
ransomware attacks between 2022 
and 2023 to determine if there were 
any changes in the time it takes for an 
attacker to carry out a ransomware 
attack. The average duration of an 
enterprise ransomware attack—the time 
between initial access and ransomware 
deployment—reduced slightly to 92\.21 
hours (3\.84 days) in 2023 from 92\.48 hours 
(3\.85 days) in 2022\. 

This minimal reduction in the ransomware 
attack lifecycle appears to be directly 
related to a 38\.44% reduction in time spent 
between obtaining domain administrator 
privileges and ransomware deployment. 
Analyzing the incident data from the 
attacks, with the largest reductions of time 
between obtaining domain administrator 

privileges and ransomware deployment, 
indicates that the attackers spent less time 
exfiltrating data than in previous years. 

It appears attackers are requiring more 
time to obtain administrative privileges 
to Active Directory compared to 2021\. 
However, this additional time may be an 
indication that 2021 was a statistical outlier 
and mainly due to attackers leveraging 
exploits like Zerologon and PrintNightmare. 

X\-Force analysis didn’t reveal any 
substantial changes in the tools, 
techniques and procedures used by threat 
actors leveraged in ransomware attacks in 
2023 compared to 2021\. It’s worth noting 
that this year’s analysis includes data from 
all mass deployment ransomware attacks, 
as opposed to our 2022 original analysis, 
which examined a subset based on 
initial access.

Top impacts

The top impact to organizations was 
data theft and leak, making up 32% of 
the incidents X\-Force responded to—
accounting for 19% of the incidents in 
2022\. This increase aligns with the rise 
in observed infostealer activity and use 
of legitimate tools to exfiltrate data. 
Furthermore, extortion incidents more 
than doubled in 2023, and the share of all 
incidents that were extortion increased 
from 21% in 2022 to 24% in 2023\.

As mentioned, extortion\-based attacks 
remained one of the driving forces of 
cybercrime in 2023 with threat actors 
leveraging various attack types to 
deliver on their extortion objectives.

Top impacts

The proliferation of ransomware attacks 
over the past few years, coupled with 
the massive efforts taken to combat and 
prevent them, has potentially pushed 
threat actors into simplifying their process. 
For example, threat actors are increasingly 
experimenting with extortion\-based 
campaigns that do not rely on ransomware 
to encrypt data. Instead, the threat can be 
related to theft of and exposure to sensitive 
internal victim data. Not only is this method 
a less resource\-intensive attack path, it 
may also be an indicator that data extortion 
tactics create the most pressure to 
elicit payment. 

The malware landscape

Evolution of malware delivery 
mechanisms
Threat actors have reacted to changes in 
the security environment by introducing 
increasingly complex infection chains 
and attempting new methods of malware 
delivery. In 2023, X\-Force observed2 actors 
using popular methods, such as email 
campaigns, leveraging:

 – OneNote files with embedded scripts
 – PDF files containing malicious links
 – Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) and 

Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) 
executables disguised as document files 

Another tactic that X\-Force observed, one which 
gained popularity in 2023 but appears to have 
since declined, is HTML smuggling. This method 
leverages HTML5 and JavaScript functionality 
to download or construct a malicious payload 
when the HTML page is opened in a web 
browser. X\-Force also frequently observes .url 
(internet shortcut) files in attack chains leading 
to the final payload. Malware distribution 
through malicious disk image files (ISO, IMG 
and VHD) and LNK files, which was noted in 
the 2023 X\-Force Threat Intelligence Index, 
has also continued to be observed with 
decreased frequency.

Top impacts

There has also been an observed uptick 
in email campaigns using Microsoft Office 
documents to deliver malware through 
exploits rather than malicious macros. 
Documents weaponized with CVE\-2017\-
11882, an arbitrary code execution 
vulnerability within the Microsoft Office 
equation editor, increased in popularity in 
the past year. Remote template injection, a 
technique to bypass email gateway controls 
by sending phishing emails that retrieve 
malicious office templates after delivery, 
was also observed in 2023\.

In addition, threat actors have increasingly 
turned to malware delivery vectors beyond 
email, the most noteworthy of which is the 
use of fraudulent Google and Bing Ads, 

also known as malvertising, to distribute 
malware through fake software downloads. 
Their payloads have included infostealers 
and backdoors, some of which have led to 
ransomware attacks. 

X\-Force has also observed additional 
threat actors using fake browser 
updates to distribute malware, including 
infostealers and the NetSupport remote 
administration tool. The Gootloader 
group continues to use SEO poisoning 
effectively to infect organizations, which 
can lead to ransomware attacks. X\-Force 
also continued to observe SEO poisoning 
leveraged by SolarMarker, which has both 
infostealer and backdoor capabilities. 

Over the past year, it has also become 
increasingly common for threat actors to 
use complex execution chains. The use 
of several stages where the malicious 
behavior is spread across multiple 
components, along with invoking living off 
the land tools, increases detection difficulty 
by analysts and security technologies such 
as endpoint detection and response (EDR). 

Complex execution chains also hinder 
the analysis capabilities of sandbox 
technologies by requiring several stages of 
execution until the final payload. Malware 
developers can implement anti\-sandbox 
checks at multiple stages, increasing the 
likelihood that the sandbox analysis fails. 
With a reduction in sandbox detections,

there’s a reduction in the likelihood of 
security researchers gaining access to 
valuable resources, such as command and 
control panels and more advanced tools. 

One example of a complex execution chain 
discovered and analyzed by X\-Force in 
2023 is the infection chain for WailingCrab 
malware. Although this infection chain is 
initialized through an email campaign with 
a PDF attachment, the final payload isn’t 
executed until 7 additional steps 
take place.

Infostealers on the rise 
The past year has seen a significant rise in 
the number of and threat actor interest in 
infostealers. Infostealers can be leveraged 
to facilitate fraud or theft by compromising 
financial or personal information. However, 
infostealers have also been frequently 
linked to more impactful attacks against 
enterprises by facilitating initial access 
through stolen credentials. 

X\-Force noted a 266% increase in 
infostealer\-related activity in 2023 
compared to 2022\. That upward trend 
likely contributed to the rise of abuse of 
valid accounts, the top initial access vector 
X\-Force observed. Infostealers have long 
been a staple of the criminal underground 
marketplace, and many operate as a 
malware\-as\-a\-service (MaaS) model. 

In addition to the well\-established stealers, 
such as RedLine, Vidar and Raccoon, 
several prominent new infostealers, 
which debuted in the latter half of 
2022, demonstrated increased activity 
throughout 2023, such as Rhadamanthys, 
LummaC2 and StrelaStealer. Different 
infostealer families target different types 
of information, from platform\-specific 
credentials to password managers to 
browser history. 

Also, observations of established stealers, 
such as Agent Tesla, FormBook, Snake 
Keylogger, Vidar, AZORult and Lokibot, 
X\-Force observed activity by the following 
recently introduced stealer families:

The success of infostealers has not 
gone unnoticed by other players in 
the cybercrime marketplace. Threat 
groups who have largely specialized 
in ransomware, such as ITG23, also 
known as TrickBot and Conti, and LockBit 
have both been linked to infostealers. 
Campaigns linked to ITG23 have been 
observed distributing the Vidar infostealer 
in late 2022\. In 2023, ITG23’s interest in 
infostealers grew to include campaigns 
involving the LummaC2 and Nemesis 
stealers during the first half of the year 

followed by the Rhadamanthys stealer in 
November. Meanwhile, LockBit announced 
its desire to purchase the Raccoon Stealer 
source code. 

malware samples targeting Microsoft 
Windows. It made up 17\.8% of samples, 
indicating continued investment in 
infostealer innovation.   

Research contributions by Intezer 
further highlight the increasing value of 
infostealers to the criminal ecosystem. 
By performing an analysis on how much a 
malware family’s source code is changing 
based on uniqueness of code versus code 
recycling, Intezer found that infostealers 
topped the list in 2023 for most unique 

As threat actors invest in infostealers 
and X\-Force observes a developing trend 
around identity abuse—through credential 
harvesting or abuse of valid accounts— 
we expect it to impact defenders’ 
detection timelines.

Abuse of cloud services

Threat actors continue to abuse a wide 
range of public and private cloud services 
for malware distribution and operation, 
allowing them to evade network detection 
mechanisms by masquerading as 
legitimate traffic. 

Discord and Telegram in particular have 
attracted significant threat actor attention, 
as multiple aspects of the platforms' 
functionality can be abused in service 
of malicious activity. Threat actors have 
misused Discord for C2, abused the 
functionality of the platform’s content 
delivery network (CDN) to host and 
distribute malware, and used its webhook 
functionality to exfiltrate data from infected 
systems. Additionally, X\-Force observed a 

novel technique in 2023 whereby a Discord C2 
channel used the native Discord bot capabilities. 

WailingCrab, a malware discovered by X\-Force 
in 2023, is a multistage malware that uses the 
Discord CDN to host further WailingCrab stages 
and other additional payloads. In addition to 
Discord, the malware was also notable for 
abusing the MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) 
protocol, which is a lightweight protocol 
designed for communication between Internet 
of Things (IoT) devices. WailingCrab uses 
the public MQTT broker EMQX for its C2 
communications, which lets it hide the true 
address of its C2, as well as allowing the C2 
communications to masquerade as legitimate 
MQTT traffic. 

GraphicalNeutrino malware is another 
notable example, which uses the cloud\-
based collaboration platform Notion for its 
C2 communications. This malware uses the 
platform’s API to send requests to a Notion 
database where it stores victim information 
and receives commands and additional 
payloads. Notably, this malware is used by a 
group that has been assessed to overlap with 
Russian espionage group APT29, which IBM 
tracks as ITG11\. 

We expect that a variety of threat actors and 
groups may explore the functionality of cloud 
services for malicious use.

Adoption of penetration 
testing techniques

Threat actors have remained interested in 
leveraging identity abuse to carry out their 
attacks and, in 2023, X\-Force observed 
threat actors targeting identity services for 
privilege escalation rather than endpoint 
credential harvesting techniques. The shift 
in behaviors appears to be in response 
to improvements in endpoint detection 
and response capabilities in preventing 
traditional credential harvesting techniques 
such as OS Credential Dumping: LSASS 
Memory (T1003\.001\).

Between 2022 and 2023, X\-Force noted a 
100% increase in Kerberoasting attacks, 
targeting the Kerberos authentication 
protocol commonly used in Microsoft 
Windows Active Directory environments. 
This method involves extracting password 
hashes by manipulating service principal 
names (SPNs) to request Kerberos tickets 

on behalf of other accounts, enabling 
attackers to crack passwords and gain 
unauthorized access. 

X\-Force observed attackers focusing on 
SPNs associated with service accounts, 
as these accounts often hold higher 
permissions, facilitating broader access to 
data and systems. Financially motivated 
attackers in 2023 also targeted Active 
Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) for 
privilege escalation, exploiting CVE\-2022–
26923 to potentially elevate their privileges 
to domain administrator. Although 
Microsoft patched this vulnerability in 
update KB5014754, successful attacks can 
still occur depending on key distribution 
center (KDC) configurations, underscoring 
the importance of vigilant patch 
management and secure service settings.

Russia\-Ukraine conflict

Throughout the course of 2023, X\-Force 
has actively monitored countless Russian 
state\-sponsored attacks, leveraging 
evolving tools and TTPs to carry out 
offensive operations against Ukraine 
and its allies. Of note, Hive0051, which 
shared overlap with Gamaredon, has 
accelerated its development efforts to 
support expanding operations since the 
onset of the ongoing conflict. X\-Force 
analysis identified three key changes to 
capabilities: an improved multichannel 
approach to Domain Name System (DNS) 
fluxing, obfuscated multistage scripts and 
the use of fileless PowerShell variants of 
the Gamma malware.

As of October 2023, X\-Force observed 
a significant increase in Hive0051 
activity. This activity features a new 
multichannel approach of rapidly rotating 
C2 infrastructure. The approach facilitated 
at least 1,027 active infections with more 
than 327 unique malicious domains 
observed in a single 24\-hour period. 

While Hive0051 has used DNS fluxing 
to avoid detection as early as December 
2022, the automated synchronized 
fluxing of dynamic DNS records across 
Telegram channels and Telegraph sites 
at scale suggests an elevation in actor 
resources and capability.

Cyberwarfare

In addition, by deploying multiple 
consecutive stages of the Hive0051 
exclusive Gamma variant malware, the 
actor is able to remap victims to separate 
sets of actor\-controlled C2 fluxing clusters.

Looking forward, it’s highly likely that 
Hive0051 will continue to foster evolving 
methodologies to facilitate operations 
potentially indicating increasingly elevated 
levels of capability.

In 2023, X\-Force observed criminal threat 
actors leveraging the ongoing conflict 
in Ukraine to craft well\-manufactured 
phishing campaigns. Since Russia’s 
invasion of its neighbor, the theme of the 
conflict has been used as lure material. 

In late May, X\-Force identified Hive0117 using 
this approach. The group capitalized on changes 
to Russian laws associated with the delivery of 
digital military conscription notices. It mimicked 
those email notices to deliver its signature 
DarkWatchman malware. The scale of the 
campaign extended across Russia, as well as 
multiple states that were once part of the Soviet 
Union. As the conflict continues, we assess that 
it’s highly likely that threat actors will continue 
to attempt to use the conflict for lure material, 
especially targeting entities associated with 
connections to the ongoing war.

Threat actors also performed distributed 
denial\-of\-service (DDoS) attacks with varying 
levels of success. A Microsoft outage that took 
place in the summer of 2023 was linked by 

a spokesperson to Anonymous Sudan, 
a DDoS group that does not claim pro\-
Russian sentiment but is linked to the 
Russia\-sympathetic group Killnet. DDoS 
group NoName057(16\), which explicitly 
distanced itself from Killnet, claimed 
attacks against Italian targets in the 
summer of 2023 and justified the attacks 
with anti\-Ukrainian rhetoric. 

Although more impactful attacks were 
threatened, such as Killnet’s threat against 
the European banking system, we have yet 
to observe the magnitude of activity implied 
by these threats and the statements of 
related group.

Israel\-Hamas conflict

In response to the war between Hamas 
and Israel, X\-Force has observed various 
claimed hacktivism operations related 
to the crisis in the region. Most targets 
were in the financial sector, government, 
travel and transportation industries, and 
the preponderance of observed activity 
originated from pro\-Palestinian groups 
targeting Israel. Telegram was the social 
media outlet of choice for most threat 
actors and where claims of their activities 
were posted. As the situation developed, 
X\-Force did observe some pro\-Israel 
hacktivist groups calling for action, in 
addition to recent posts from Gonjeshke 
Darande, also known as Predatory Sparrow.

In addition, X\-Force uncovered multiple 
lure documents that predominately 
feature the ongoing Israel\-Hamas war 
to facilitate the delivery of the ITG05 
exclusive Headlace backdoor. X\-Force 
tracks ITG05 as a likely Russian state\-
sponsored group consisting of multiple 
activity clusters, sharing overlaps with 
industry\-identified threat actor groups 
APT28, UAC\-028, Fancy Bear and Forest 
Blizzard. The newly discovered campaign is 
directed against targets based in at least 13 
nations worldwide and leverages authentic 
documents created by academic, finance 
and diplomatic centers.

For organizations located in the region, 
X\-Force recommended that clients review 
their network security posture for readiness 
against malicious hacktivist activity, 
including DDoS, website defacement 
or enumeration of networked devices 
vulnerable to data disclosure. Contacting 
a DDoS mitigation provider, having and 
practicing a DDoS incident response plan, 
and ensuring that incident responders 
have up\-to\-date contact information for 
DDoS mitigation and internet service 
providers help organizations that are

Generative AI: A new 
cyberthreat frontier

X\-Force hasn’t been able to confirm the use 
of gen AI in current malicious campaigns. 
However, there are some threat actors 
paying attention to the marketing value 
of AI and showing it in the services they 
allegedly offer. Two tools available to 
attackers that were built to be unrestricted 
or semi\-restricted large language models 
(LLMs) for cybercriminals that stood out are 
FraudGPT and WormGPT. These tools are 
advertised on various forums and Telegram 
channels—each supporting the capability 
to craft phishing emails, among other 
malicious activities. 

In August 2023, WormGPT developers 
released a statement that they would 
be shutting down the project, claiming 
that it gained unforeseen popularity, and 
that news reporting mischaracterized it. 

FraudGPT is a euphemism for the services 
offered by CanadianKingpin12 (CK12\), a 
cybercriminal service broker and associate 
of a likely self\-organized group called 
the Cashflow Cartel (CFC), based on an 
assessment made by X\-Force. On the CFC’s 
bot\-driven Telegram channel, a user may 
choose to purchase illegal services that 
include credit cards, hacked accounts and 
AI capabilities, with prices ranging from 
USD 90 to USD 700 based on the service. 

As X\-Force didn’t pay to experiment with 
any of these services, it wasn’t possible to 
confirm the extent to which this tool could 
or could not support cybercriminals in their 
offensive cyber operations.

Indicators of AI attack surface 
maturity

While X\-Force hasn’t observed confirmed 
AI\-engineered campaigns to date, it’s 
expected that cybercriminals will seek 
to leverage AI in their operations and, 
as previously illustrated, they’re already 
exploring how. In fact, X\-Force has 
observed AI and GPT mentioned in over 
800,000 posts in illicit markets and dark 
web forums in 2023, as evidence of 
cybercriminals’ interest in the technology. 
While it’s not unlikely to see AI\-enabled 
attacks reported in the near term, X\-Force 
assesses that proliferated activity won’t be 
established until the pace of enterprise AI 
adoption matures. 

With that likelihood in mind, X\-Force took 
a deep dive into the cybercrime industry 
to reflect on technological enablers and 

milestones that fostered cybercriminal 
activities in the past. Doing so helps us 
identify future industry trends that are 
likely to create opportunities for criminals—
amid the rate of enterprise AI adoption 
that’s anticipated over the next decade.

In review of the past three years of the 
X\-Force Threat Intelligence Index and IBM 
X\-Force Cloud Threat Landscape Report, 
cybercriminals have largely focused their 
operations on the following attack types:

 – Ransomware
 – Business email compromise (BEC)
 – Cryptojacking 

X\-Force performed a deep analysis of the 
incident data surrounding these three 
attack types. The research revealed 
common themes in terms of tools, software 
or platforms—correlating rate of tech 
adoption with rate of exploitation—helping 
us establish an indicator of AI attack 
surface maturity. 

As we’ll illustrate here, the findings suggest 
that attackers will begin to build at\-scale 
attacks targeting specific technologies 
once the technologies establish market 
dominance. Based on the data analyzed, 
market dominance can be interpreted 
as when a single technology approaches

50% market share or when the market 
consolidates to three or less technologies. 
Our analysis indicates.

 – Windows Server market dominance 
triggered the development of point\-
of\-sale (POS) malware and human\-
operated ransomware attacks, which 
relied upon Active Directory. In 2006, 
Windows Server became the most widely 
used server OS and subsequently Active 
Directory established further dominance 
in the directory service market. Three 
years later, nation\-state actors began 
leveraging Active Directory to carry out 

their operations. By 2014, cybercriminals 
created attack paths upon Windows and 
Active Directory setting the stage for 
human\-operated ransomware attacks in 
the years following. 

 – Losses from BEC scams saw a sharp 
upward climb once Microsoft 365 
neared 50% market share adoption. In 
2019, Office 365 (now Microsoft 365\) 
represented 48% of the market share 
when losses from BEC scams exceeded 
USD 1\.7 billion and 25% of phishing 
attacks bypassed Microsoft’s security 
mechanisms. Within a year, the FBI 
issued a warning that attackers were 

abusing Office 365 in BEC attacks using 
phishing kits designed to mimic cloud\-
based email services.

 – The infrastructure\-as\-a\-service (IaaS) 
market consolidation supercharged 
the crypto mining malware expansion.
Between 2017 and 2018 the cloud IaaS 
market consolidated from 14 players 
down to six with the top three vendors 
controlling roughly 60% of the market. 
During the same time, an 8,500% 
increase in crypto mining was reported.

The ransomware era

The market path to ransomware

In 2000, Active Directory was released 
to the market as part of Windows Server 
2000\. By the following year, Microsoft’s 
share in the server operating system 
market had jumped to 49%.3 And by 2006, 
Windows surpassed UNIX in the server 
OS market making Active Directory the 
dominate player in the directory services 
market—after which we began to observe 
attackers exploiting the technology. 

Just as Figure 9 illustrates, exploitation 
gradually increases as tech adoption 
scales. Nation\-state actors were the first 
to set their sights on Active Directory, 
leveraging it in famous attacks between 
2009 and 2011, such as NightDragon4 
operations and the attack against RSA.5 

Nation\-state actors target at least 12 multinational oil, gas, 
and petrochemical companies in Kazakhstan, Taiwan, Greece, 
and the United States, by exploiting Active Directory domain 
administrator accounts.

In 2011, French security researcher 
Benjamin Delpy released the credential 
harvesting tool Mimikatz,6 significantly 
reducing the technical capability 
requirements to steal domain credentials. 
Nation\-state and financially motivated 
attackers quickly adopted the tool to carry 
out their operations. 

2014, dubbed the “year of POS malware” 
by Trend Micro,7 saw financially motivated 
actors adopting advanced persistent threat 
(APT)\-style attacks, leveraging Mimikatz 
and Active Directory to move throughout 
the network to gain access to the POS 
systems.8, 9 The attack chains established 
during the 2014 POS attacks set the stage 
for the emergence of human\-operated 

ransomware attacks in the future as 
evidenced by the POS threat actor groups 
migrating their operations from POS to 
ransomware.10

Today, Active Directory is used at over 
75,000 companies globally,11 while a 2021 
industry report12 states that 80% of attacks 
use Active Directory to perform lateral 
movement and privilege escalations. The 
pattern is similar with PowerShell, which 
was included by default in 98% of Windows 
installs by 2017\.13 

As it became commonplace within 
the enterprise network, tools such as 
PowerShell Empire were created to simplify 
PowerShell\-based attacks,14 and were 

rapidly adopted by threat actors to carry 
out their attacks. Together, the market 
dominance of Active Directory and ubiquity 
of PowerShell enabled a years\-long 
ransomware spree. Ransomware went on 
to become the most common attack type 
observed for three years in a row according 
to our threat intelligence. 

It’s worth noting that Active Directory and 
PowerShell in and of themselves don’t 
make an organization any more or less 
secure. However, the default deployment 
configuration, which was the most common 
deployment15 of Active Directory, does 
provide a known technical landscape in 
which attackers can plan an attack upon.

The BEC success story
The FBI started tracking BEC scams in 
2013 as “emerging financial cyberthreats” 
targeting businesses.16 The rapid adoption 
of email in the 2000s was the defining 
factor in the decades\-long success of BEC 
and overall phishing attacks. 

To meet the demand for BEC campaigns, 
the criminal market narrowed its focus 
and created phishing tools specifically for 
compromising corporate email services. 
The historical evidence suggests that as 
the technology market coalesces around 
different technologies, such as Microsoft 
365 for email, the criminal developers 
creating tools for BEC attacks tailored their 
tools to match ubiquitous technologies.

Following the users: BEC takes to Office 365

businesses, resulting in significant 
financial losses.18 That same year multiple 
ransomware19 and phishing20, 21 attacks 
exploiting Microsoft 365 were reported. 

As market adoption grew over the coming 
years, the volume of phishing and BEC 
attacks tied to the technology began 
to steadily increase, as did financial 
losses for businesses. By 2019, Office 
365 represented 48% of the market 

share22 and the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) 
had issued an advisory23 regarding  Office 
365 configurations that could lead to 
compromises. At the same time, the FBI’s 
Internet Crime Complaint Center received 
23,000 complaints related to BEC and 
email account compromise (EAC) scams,24 
leading to adjusted losses exceeding USD 
1\.7 billion that same year.

Throughout the decade, attackers evolved 
their TTPs, innovating to bypass security 
measures put in place to further protect 
against the growing risk of phishing and 
investing in an attack surface that seemed 
to keep growing. In 2023, Microsoft 365

adoption among big companies grew to 
83%.25 Reinforcing how attackers have 
adapted to Microsoft 365 adoption for 
enterprises, Egress’ Email Security Risk 
Report stated that 92% of organizations 
have fallen victim to a successful phishing 
attack in their Microsoft 365 environment 
in 2023\.27

Graphing out the FBI reported losses 
due to BEC attacks and the adoption of 
Microsoft 365 year over year shows similar 
trendlines, indicating that attackers have 
adapted their TTPs to the market trends 
regarding technology adoption. Since the 

FBI began tracking BECs as their own 
category in 2015, the dollar amount of 
losses has steadily increased year over year 
with significant jumps in 2017, 2018 and 
2019\. BEC losses increased respectively 
by 87\.5%, 77\.78% and 41\.67% over the 
previous year. These BEC attacks have 
been so successful that the FBI reported 
in 2022 that USD 2\.7 billion in losses were 
reported, making it the second most costly 
criminal type tracked in the report.26

Cryptojacking
Cryptojacking became a feature of the 
cyberthreat landscape shortly after the 
introduction of cryptocurrency. In 2011, 
early manifestations of this activity took 
the form of Trojans, which leveraged the 
resources of compromised endpoints to 
mine cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin.28 
This type of malware used GPU resources, 
rather than CPUs, due to higher computing 
power and, therefore, higher returns but 
had fewer targets due to limited GPU use 
within general purpose computing.29

Generative AI: A new cyberthreat frontier

During the period 2017–2018, 
cryptojacking significantly shifted in nature. 
First, cryptojacking became much more 
common. Over time, changes in computing 
capabilities and the introduction of 
cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and 
Monero, had enabled cybercriminals to 
shift their focus back to abusing devices’ 
CPU resources, which are much more 
widely found compared to GPU hardware.29   
Crypto mining activity had skyrocketed, 
largely targeting home network devices 
and endpoints.30, 31

Generative AI: A new cyberthreat frontier

Additionally, increased observations of 
cryptojacking in 2017–2018 coincided with 
unprecedented prices for cryptocurrencies 
Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero that same 
year, which likely further incentivized this 
activity.32, 33, 34 While large ransomware 
operations would surge in later years as the 
ransomware\-as\-a\-service model took root, 
for a brief period in 2018 cryptojacking vied 
with ransomware as the growing threat in 
the spotlight.29, 35, 36 Some cybercriminal 
groups associated with ransomware also 
began incorporating capabilities targeting 
cryptocurrency, for example TrickBot, 
Rakhni Trojan.37, 38 X\-Force research in 
2018 found a 45% decrease in ransomware 
attacks compared to a 450% increase in 
cryptojacking activity.39 This same period 
saw the market consolidation of cloud IaaS 
offerings, as illustrated in Figure 12\.

Threats to generative AI: 
What looms ahead?

These patterns suggest that for 
cybercriminals to see ROI from attacking 
AI platforms and for developing easy\-to\-
use tools on the criminal underground, 
the technology they’re targeting must be 
ubiquitous across most organizations 
in the world. Otherwise, cybercrime 
attacks would require too much time 
and money, negatively impacting profits. 
Defenders should consider the AI market 
share as an indicator for the AI attack 
surface’s maturity. 

While more organizations say they are 
developing AI models, and AI is being 
used in different solutions, the AI market 
is currently in a pre\-mass market period. 
Startups and established corporations 
are both jostling for a design favored 
by the market. This period will end with 

the emergence of a design favorited by 
the market that has enough proprietary 
innovations and an open enough 
architecture to be adopted by the majority 
of consumers. 

Once AI market dominance is established—
when a single technology approaches 50% 
market share or the market consolidates 
to three or less technologies—we assess 
it will trigger the maturity of AI as an 
attack surface. The result will be that 
cybercriminals will then further mobilize 
and increase their investment in 
attacking AI.

Geographic trends

Europe experienced the most 
ransomware attacks globally 
with 26%

\#1 \| Europe

With Europe coming in at number one 
overall, malware was the most observed 
action on objective, accounting for 44% 
of incidents. Europe experienced the 
most ransomware attacks globally with 
26%, which partly contributed to its rise 
in ranking in 2023\. A large ransomware 
campaign in February 2023 dubbed 
ESXiArgs impacted organizations across 
Europe and targeted a vulnerability in 
VMware ESXi servers 
(CVE\-2021\-21974\). The use of legitimate 
tools for malicious purposes and server 
access cases rounded out the top three 
actions on objective, representing 29% 
and 18% respectively. 

Europe’s high use of cloud platforms 
may also result in a potentially larger 
attack surface compared to other regions, 
especially if attackers are able to obtain 
valid cloud accounts to gain initial access. 
In 30% of incidents, attackers used valid 
accounts, whether cloud, domain or local, 
to compromise European organizations. 
Phishing tied with the use of valid 
accounts at 30%, while the exploitation 
of public\-facing applications and use 
of external remote services accounted 
for 20% each. The top three impacts 
to European\-based organizations were 
credential harvesting at 28%, extortion 
at 24% and data leak at 16%. 

Manufacturing moved from second 
place in 2022 to the most\-attacked 
industry, accounting for 28% of incidents. 
Professional, business and consumer 
services placed second with 25% of 
cases and in third place was finance and 
insurance at 16%, surpassing energy, which 
held fourth place at 14%. 

The United Kingdom was the most attacked 
country in Europe, accounting for 27% 
of cases. Germany accounted for 15%, 
Denmark 14%, Portugal 11%, and Italy 
and France each represented 8%. X\-Force 
also responded to smaller numbers of 
cases in Greece, Austria, Greenland, Spain, 
Poland, Switzerland, Netherlands, Ukraine 
and Belgium.

In North America, the use of 
valid accounts was the top 
initial access vector at 41%

\#2 \| North America

North America continues to climb slightly 
year over year, moving from 23% of all 
cases in 2021 to 25% in 2022 and now 
26% in 2023, making it the second most 
impacted region globally. The top actions 
on objective in this region were the 
deployment of malware and the use of 
legitimate tools for malicious purposes, 
accounting for 46% of incidents each. The 
most prevalent malware observed across 
incidents were backdoors at 14% and 
ransomware and bots at 11% each. Server 
access cases came in second at 21% and 
BEC cases made up 7%, placing it at a 
distant third.

The use of valid accounts was the top 
initial access vector at 41% of incidents. 
The prevalence regarding the use of valid 
domain accounts is a new trend from 
2022, where the exploitation of public\-

facing applications was the top initial 
access vector in North America. This shift 
is likely due to threat actors attempting 
to evade EDR and network detection 
and response (NDR) products by using 
credentials acquired from criminal markets, 
infostealers or other credential harvesting 
campaigns. At 32% of incidents, the 
exploitation of public\-facing applications 
still made up a large share in 2023, placing 
it in second place and the use of phishing 
rounded out the top three at 27%.

Credential harvesting remained the top 
impact, accounting for a slightly larger 
share of incidents (28%) in 2023 than in 
the previous year (25%). Data theft and 
extortion tied for second place at 24% 
each, and reconnaissance accounted for 
20% of cases X\-Force remediated in 
North America.

Professional, business and consumer 
services rose from third place in 2022 
to the most\-targeted industry in North 
America in 2023, accounting for 22% of 
cases. The retail and wholesale sector 
remained in second place at 18% and 
healthcare rose one spot from fourth place 
in 2022 to third place in 2023, accounting 
for 15% of incidents. Energy, which was in 
first place in 2022, dropped to sixth place 
in 2023, making up 9% of incidents.

The United States accounted for 
86% of the region’s attacks compared 
to Canada’s 14%.

Dropping from first place in 2022 to third 
in 2023, the Asia\-Pacific region accounted 
for 23% of incidents X\-Force responded 
to globally. Malware was the top action on 
objective once again, representing 45% 
of attacks with ransomware accounting 
for 17% of incidents and infostealers at 
10%. Backdoors, which accounted for 
31% in 2022, made up only 3% of cases 
in 2023\. The use of legitimate tools for 
malicious purposes placed second at 
28% with tools that exfiltrate data one of 
the most observed at 14% of incidents. 
Server access cases, accounting for 14% 
of incidents, was the third most observed 
action on objective against Asia\-Pacific 
organizations.

Phishing was the top initial access 
vector, accounting for 36% of incidents. 
Exploitation of public\-facing applications 
came in a close second at 35% of 
incidents. The use of valid accounts, abuse 
of trusted relationship and replication 
through removable media all tied for third, 
accounting for 12% of the cases each. 
Top impacts to this region were brand 
reputation and data theft at 27% each, 
followed by extortion, data destruction and 
data leak all accounting for 20% of cases.

Manufacturing, represented in 46% of 
the incidents, was the most\-attacked 
industry in Asia\-Pacific for the second 
year in a row. The finance and insurance, 
and transportation industries tied for 
second, accounting for 12% of cases each, 
while education was third at 8%. Japan

2023, accounting for 12% of cases that 
X\-Force responded to. For the purposes of 
reporting, IBM considers Latin America to 
include Mexico, Central America and South 
America. X\-Force continues to observe 
new and improved campaigns that target 
Latin America specifically, emphasizing 
a worrying trend of increased risk to the 
region in the future.  

Malware, and specifically ransomware, 
was once again the top action on objective 
observed across incidents in this region, 
representing 31% of the attacks. Server 
access and use of tools for malicious 
purposes each accounted for 23% of cases. 
Exploitation of public\-facing applications 
moved from second to first place for 

initial access vectors, comprising 45% of 
the cases. The use of phishing and valid 
accounts tied for second at 22% of cases 
each. Replication through removable media 
followed at 11%. 

Of impacts to clients, 33% of cases X\-Force 
observed in Latin America were data leak 
related. 22% resulted in extortion or had 
an impact on brand reputation and illicit 
financial gain, botnet, data theft and 
credential harvesting, each represented 
11% of cases. 

Once again, retail\-wholesale returned as 
one of the most attacked industries at 25% 
of cases that X\-Force remediated. Finance 
and insurance tied for first place, moving 
up from second place in 2022\. IBM has 
observed an uptick in campaigns leveraging 

malicious Chrome extensions, the majority 
of which focused on Latin American 
financial entities. X\-Force has also seen 
increased development and activity of 
.NET\-based banking Trojans targeting 
banking customers in Latin America, 
such as BlotchyQuasar, KLBanker and 
Banker.FN. Several industries tied for 
second: mining, manufacturing and 
energy at 14% each.

Brazil remained the most attacked country 
in Latin America, making up 68% of all the

African continent, was the fifth most 
targeted geographic region, representing 
7% of incidents in 2023\. In half of the 
incidents X\-Force responded to in this 
region, the deployment of malware was 
observed. At 17% each, DDoS, email threat 
hijacking, server access and the use of 
legitimate tools for malicious purposes 
represented the remaining top actions 
on objectives.

The use of valid local accounts at 52% 
and valid cloud accounts at 48% were 
the main initial infection vectors used on 
organizations in the Middle East and Africa 
region and espionage was the top impact.

Once again, the finance and insurance

Industry trends

For the third year in a row, manufacturing 
was the top\-attacked industry, according 
to X\-Force incident response data. The 
finance and insurance industry was in 
second place again for the third year in a 
row. Share of attacks across energy, retail 
and wholesale, healthcare, transportation 
and arts, entertainment and recreation 
sectors increased year over year. 

Notably, 69\.6% of attacks that X\-Force 
responded to in 2023 were against critical 
infrastructure organizations.40 Attackers 
exploited public\-facing applications in 30% 
of incidents, making it the most common 
cause of attacks on critical infrastructure, 
with phishing and the use of valid accounts 
closely following, each representing 29% 
and 25% of attacks observed. 

Malware was deployed in 44% of incidents, 
with ransomware making up most of those 
attacks at 23%. Use of legitimate tools for 
credential acquisition, remote access and 
data exfiltration, was also a common action 
on objective seen in 34% of incidents. 

About a third of attacks on critical 
infrastructure led to data theft and 
leak, with extortion and credential 
harvesting following at 29% and 24%, 
respectively. The data reaffirmed that 
critical infrastructure is a high\-value 
target to adversaries, wagering on these 
organizations’ low threshold for downtime 
to advance on their objectives.

59%

of healthcare incidents 
involved valid account abuse

\#6 \| Healthcare

Moving up one spot from the seventh most 
attacked in 2022 to sixth most attacked 
in 2023 and accounting for 6\.3% of total 
attacks is healthcare. The use of legitimate 
tools for malicious purposes was the most 
observed action on objective, accounting 
for 43% of incidents, and spam campaigns 
and malware cases tied for second, 
representing 29% of attacks each. Email 
thread hijacking and server access cases 
each represented 14%.

The top infection vectors observed in 
the healthcare industry was the use of 
valid accounts at 59% of incidents. The 
exploitation of public\-facing applications 

at 21% and the use of phishing at 20% 
rounded out the top three. The top impact 
observed was credential harvesting, 
accounting for half of the cases, followed 
by reconnaissance, data leak and extortion, 
each representing 25% of the cases.

X\-Force responded to 50% of cases in 
North America, 38% in Europe, 6% in the 
Asia\-Pacific and 6% in Latin America.

40%

of government incidents 
involved phishing incidents

\#7 \| Government

Accounting for 4\.3% of incidents—
and moving up one spot from 2022—
government was the seventh most attacked 
industry in 2023\. The use of legitimate 
tools for malicious purposes and DDoS 
attacks were the most observed actions 
on objective, each accounting for 33% 
of incidents. Server access, adware and 
malware each accounted for 17% of cases.

The top infection vector observed in 
government was phishing at 40% of 
incidents. The exploitation of public\-facing 
applications, replication through removable 
media and drive\-by compromises were 
each observed in 20% of cases. The 
top impacts observed were credential 
harvesting, data leak, extortion and 
botnet activity, each representing 33% 
of the cases. 

In 2023, government entities, though 
representing a small fraction of reported 
incidents, witnessed an uptick in 
cybersecurity threats, according to X\-Force, 
compared to 2022\. Despite being the 
least likely to meet ransom demands, 
governments remain attractive targets for 
criminal threat actors. 

The persistence of cybercriminals in 
targeting government networks is fueled 
by the vast amount of sensitive data these 
entities possess, obtained through the wide 
range of services provided to companies 
and people. Successful breaches could 
result in the leakage of state\-level 
intelligence, classified assets and personal 
identifiable information (PII). Such leakage 
poses risks, such as identity theft, creation 
of forged documents, unauthorized access 

to organizations and the takeover of 
privileged accounts through the sale 
of stolen data in dark marketplaces.

X\-Force responded to 64% of cases in 
North America, 26% in the Asia\-Pacific 
and 9% in the Middle East and Africa.

of transportation incidents 
involved data leak 
and extortion

\#8 \| Transportation

Up from ninth place in 2022, transportation 
accounted for 4\.3% of incidents and ranked 
eighth in 2023\. Malware and the use of 
legitimate tools for malicious purposes 
were the top actions on objective observed, 
both representing 38% of attacks. Server 
access attacks were observed in 13% 
of incidents. 

Data leak and extortion were both the top 
impacts on transportation organizations, 
involved in 67% of incidents each, 
followed by data destruction at 33%. The 
exploitation of public\-facing applications 

and use of phishing were the top initial 
infection vectors, each representing 50% 
of incidents impacting the transportation 
industry, followed by use of valid local 
accounts, used in 25% of attacks.

Unlike 2022, where European 
transportation entities were the most 
targeted group, in 2023, the Asia\-Pacific 
experienced the most attacks at 63%. The 
Middle East and Africa accounted for 27% 
of attacks in this industry, while Europe 
accounted for 10%.

Recommendations

In 2023, the combination of a rise in 
infostealers and the abuse of valid 
account credentials to gain initial access 
has exacerbated defenders’ identity and 
access management challenges. The 
threat landscape’s newly found focus on 
identities highlights organizations’ risks 
that exist on devices outside of their 
visibility. Enterprise credential data can be 
stolen from compromised devices through 
credential reuse, browser credential stores 
or accessing enterprise accounts directly 
from personal devices. 

The speed of an intrusion has increased 
due to effective, repeatable attack paths—
as seen with the massive exploitation of 
MFT tools and Kerberoasting attacks—
and the growing efficiency in the criminal 
marketplace through realized competitive 
advantage. And while ransomware 
and other malware continue to plague 
organizations, cybercriminals have 
begun to explore how to leverage AI in 
their operations. 

Given these trends, how should 
organizations respond and where should 
they start?

Recommendations

Reduce the risk of credential 
harvesting attacks
Deploying EDR tools on all servers and 
workstations in your environment helps 
detect malware, including infostealers 
and ransomware. The tools can also 
detect anomalous behavior, such as the 
exfiltration of data, querying of sensitive 
information or the creation of new accounts 
or folders on sensitive systems. 

Leverage experts to learn more about how 
to build and operationalize threat hunting 
within your environment. If resources 
are limited, extend your team by using AI 
to handle up to 85% of alerts and gain 
24x7 protection with threat detection and 
response services. Additionally, use threat 
intelligence to identify key opportunities for 
mitigating new and emerging threats from 
attackers looking to steal your credentials. 

Harden your credential management 
practices to protect your system or 
domain credentials by implementing MFA 
and strong password policies to include 
use of passkeys, and leverage hardened 
system configurations that make accessing 
credentials more difficult. Credential 
harvesting attacks are also often carried 
out through phishing and watering 
hole attacks. 

Routinely provide employee education 
with updated phishing techniques used 
by attackers. Scrutinize all third\-party 
traffic—treat it as untrusted until otherwise 
verified. Watering hole attackers often 
leverage legitimate resources to deliver 
their malware.

Reduce blast radius
Cybersecurity blast radius refers to the 
potential impact of an incident given the 
compromise of particular users, devices 
or data. For example, if an account with 
administrative privileges is compromised, 
the blast radius is greater than if a normal 
nonprivileged account is given the ability to 
move laterally and access additional data 
across the network. 

Given the importance of data security and 
identity management in the current threat 
landscape, organizations should consider 
implementing solutions to reduce the 
damage that a data security incident could 
potentially cause. 

Previous chapter

Recommendations

Strategies to reduce blast radius:

Employ dark web capabilities that:

 – Implement a least\-privileged framework.
 – Provide identity and network 

segmentation.

 – Implement data security and protection 

solutions.

 – Provide continuous monitoring and 

incident response.

Know your dark web exposure
Attackers may leverage harvested 
credentials for their own exploits, trade 
them on the dark web—or both. The data 
that’s available about your organization on 
the dark web highlights the risk that resides 
outside your network perimeter’s control. 

 – Find at\-risk credentials and session keys.
 – Check your executive’s digital identities 
to find overexposure of PII, criticism 
against executives and fraudulent profile 
creation in social networks.

 – Scan social networks, channels related to 
your sector, and blogs and advertising for 
unauthorized brand use.

 – Identify leaked priority, confidential and 

sensitive data.

 – Assess forums, credit card markets, 
Telegram channels, chat rooms and 
discussions, code repositories, document 
and file repositories, surface web 
crawlers, and paste sites checking 
for credential exposure and stolen 
session keys.

Remove fragmented identity silos
Properly deploying a product\-agnostic 
identity fabric can extend modern security 
and detection and response capabilities 
to outdated applications and systems. 
Simplify identify management through a 
single identity and access management 
(IAM) provider to administer identity 
governance, manage workforce and 
consumer identity and access, and 
control privileged accounts. Streamline 
the undertaking with identity and 
security experts to help you define and 
manage solutions across hybrid cloud 
environments, transform governance 
workflows and demonstrate compliance.

Recommendations

Implement a DevSecOps approach 
and testing
X\-Force found that the most observed 
risk across client environments globally 
in 2023 was security misconfigurations 
and, of those found, the top offenses 
included allowing concurrent user sessions 
in the application. Limit the possibility of 
session hijacking by implementing a 
DevSecOps approach and use secured, 
encrypted connections (HTTPS) and 
implement session timeouts and prompt 
for reauthentication. Engage penetration 
testing services to test your applications, 
networks, hardware and personnel to 
identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses 
across all your assets.

Have a plan
Despite organizations’ best efforts to 
reduce the risk of attack, incidents can 
happen. Having incident response plans 
that are customized for your environment 
is key to reducing the time to respond, 
remediate and recover from an attack. 
Those plans should be regularly drilled and 
include a cross\-organizational response, 
incorporate stakeholders outside of IT 
and test lines of communication between 
technical teams and senior leadership. 
Finally, testing your plan in an immersive, 
high\-pressure cyber range exercise can 
greatly enhance your ability to respond 
to an attack.

Establish secured AI\+ business models
Securing AI is broader than AI itself. 
Organizations can leverage existing 
guardrails to help secure the AI pipeline. 
The key tenets to focus on are securing 
the AI underlying training data, the 
models, and the use and inferencing of the 
models, but also the broader infrastructure 
surrounding the models. The same access 
points that cybercriminals are leveraging 
to compromise enterprises pose the same 
type of risk to AI. And as organizations 
offload operational business processes to 
AI, they also need to establish governance 
and make operational guardrails central to 
their AI strategy.
