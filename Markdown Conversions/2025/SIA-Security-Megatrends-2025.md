# SECURING THE CHANNEL
At SIA, our mission is to be a catalyst for success in the global security industry. 
We serve the business community of our industry. At our core are the individu-
als and companies that develop, produce, install, integrate, design, specify, mon-
itor and operate the products, solutions and services that keep our world safe. 
Our member companies and their employees are our foundation, and to help 
keep our industry on the forefront of security, we endeavor to produce research and trends analysis 
that gives our members an edge and an eye to the future.
Our annual Security Megatrends report, first published with the 2017 report, and now in its ninth 
year with this 2025 report, is part of that commitment to keep you prepared for the future.
The future isn’t always predictable, but it’s always exciting. Artificial intelligence has burst upon 
our industry in recent years and holds great promise for our industry’s future. We have watched as 
operational technology (OT) converges with information technology (IT) and simultaneously with all 
aspects of security—physical and cyber. These profound changes call upon us to adapt and to realign 
our industry to the needs of the modern business world.
Another area of rapid evolution we see today is the changes in technology and in business and 
delivery models that systems integration businesses face. Integrators are the second largest core of 
our membership, just after the technology solution producers (product manufacturers and software 
firms). The amount of upheaval facing today’s integrators is profound. Technology producers are 
delivering more advanced solutions than the integrator has ever seen. The integrators are no longer 
connecting isolated solutions, but are delivering networked solutions that are fundamental to the end 
users’ businesses, and must be competent in not only traditional security and safety requirements, 
but now are expected to interface those systems with other IT and OT systems, and must do so in a 
way that matches the customer’s IT requirements and cyber security.
Simultaneously, today’s systems integrator must ensure those systems are not only improving the 
organization’s security but are providing business insights that transcend core security and safety 
needs – and they must do this while navigating business  model changes that see more and more 
direct-to-customer sales, software-as-a-service and managed services revenue models that are 
unlike what they worked with even 5 or 10 years ago.
This year’s Megatrends report ranks that “Evolution of the Channel” as the No. 1 trend facing 
the business of security, a theme that was heard repeatedly at the 2024 Securing New Ground 
conference and in the surveys and focus group calls that powered this year’s report. The top ranking 
and deep focus we have put on this trend is not only seen in this year’s Security Megatrends 
report, but in our early 2024 report “The Evolving Security Industry: The Adaptation of the Systems 
Integrator,” along with our continued focus in providing online and in-person education and 
certification for integrators that ranges from our Security Industry Cybersecurity Certification (SICC), 
our Security Project Management training and certification programs, our Cornerstones modules 
for onboarding new employees, our GrantED training program to help integrators unlock grant 
opportunities for their clients, and various technical and business skill programs offered through our 
e-learning platform SIAcademy.
We remain committed to assisting our integrator members as they adapt and we believe that a 
vibrant channel is essential to the industry’s overall health and to the business performance of ALL 
our members, including our SPARC community of corporate security leaders.
Special Thanks: We want to thank all our members who took time to participate in the annual 
survey, attend the Megatrends sessions at SNG, guest contributors and especially our advisory 
boards who served as focus groups. We also thank our SNG speakers, from whom many of these 
insights are drawn. We thank you for allowing us to help serve you and be a catalyst for your 
success!.
Sincerely,
Scott Dunn
Chair, SIA Board of Directors

# HOW WE DEFINED AND RESEARCHED THE 2024 SIA SECURITY MEGATRENDS
Each year at Securing New Ground (SNG), senior-level 
industry leaders and financial partners gather, trends are 
discussed, connections are formed and ideas are shared 
openly. In advance of SNG, as part of our annual membership 
survey, SIA asked hundreds of executives from SIA member 
companies what factors were shaping their business 
decisions and what trends they were watching. We then 
further surveyed SIA members, along with current and 
recent speakers and attendees of SNG about which previous 
trends were still relevant, which trends were no longer 
as impactful to the industry and which trends could be 
identified to be added to our report.
Simultaneous to the surveys at SNG and to the SIA 
membership, our group of SIA Megatrends advisors 
provided focused feedback on the megatrends via in-depth 
conversations and collaborative editing. The value of insights 
from these leaders and luminaries cannot be overstated 
(thank you, Steve, Tara, Eric, Devin, Bill, John, Kasia, Brian and 
Faisal).
In addition to the survey research and the focused 
conversations, the selection of these trends relies on the 
speakers, panel and audience members of SNG, because the 
conference is the ultimate proving ground for deep-dive 
discussions on what we can do as an industry to pave a 
successful future. A special session during the 2024 SNG 
conference (hosted by Van Till, Dunning and Yunag) provided 
additional feedback related to the Security Megatrends and 
helped generate some of the chart data included in this 
report. Lastly, as we authored this report, we tried to reflect 
not only the vendor/integrator/service provider side of the 
industry but to include again a brief reflection on how each 
trend may impact the security practitioner or CSO.
Through SIA’s research and the vetting, validation and 
additional research that occurs during and after SNG, 
here we have, hopefully, not only captured the industry's 
driving forces in the 2025 Security Megatrends report, but 
also provided you insights and action items to facilitate a 
successful future in the security industry.

“Rarely do we see a cyber-only or physical-only attack. The threat 
landscape is very blended.”  
– Brian Harrell, CSO, Avangrid, and member, SIA Board of Directors
“We have put a strong focus on AI. We want to get to more predictive 
security rather than reactive security and also do maintenance 
monitoring – we want the systems and devices to tell us when 
something is going to fail before it fails.”  
– Jeff Stanek, president, security, Honeywell
“Customers are recognizing their data is valuable. As an industry, we 
have a ton of data that has not been used to train these AI models.”  
– Pauline Nordstrom, founder and CEO, Anekanta Consulting, and member, SIA 
AI Advisory Board
“People don’t understand the sustainability aspect of AI. It takes lots 
of power and cost to train and operate these models.”  
– Quang Trinh, business development manager – platform technologies, Axis 
Communications, and member, SIA AI Advisory Board
“Everyone is a hardware integrator, not a software integrator. AI will 
create confluences in workflow automation. From the manufacturing 
side, we need to align workflow automation with AI so that end 
users can see the benefits of it. How do you build the templates to 
create workflow automation so that the integrator can automate the 
integration of AI devices and AI software?”  
– Niru Satgunananthan, head of ESS business development and solutions 
architecture, Johnson Controls, and member, SIA AI Advisory Board
“From the contract monitoring side, everyone has moved into 
interactive voice response state to reduce the number of nonessential 
phone calls. AI has helped reduce noise, but it’s still a long way from AI 
contextualized monitoring. The contextualized piece is what has been 
missing.”  
– Kurt Takahashi, CEO, Netwatch
“Ethical use of AI is the top priority for us. We as manufacturers must 
demonstrate commitment to the ethical use of AI. We have three 
principles. Fake images can’t be generated, machine learning must not 
be biased, and privacy must be protected with machine learning. We 
must demonstrate a commitment; otherwise, we shouldn’t be allowed 
to use such new tech which has some risks.” 
– Masato Nakao, chairman and CEO, i-Pro
“There is unbelievable confusion in the systems integration community 
related to SaaS – unbelievable confusion as to how things should be 
priced, how the integrator fits into the traditional SaaS model versus 
perpetual licensing. Who wins and who suffers will be fascinating.”  
– Bill Bozeman, Security Megatrends Advisor and Chair, SIA AI Advisory Board
These trends, some previously long 
recognized as Security Megatrends, 
are now so much part of the fabric of 
the world that they are viewed no lon-
ger as future-looking megatrends, but 
instead as common concerns that all 
business leaders must manage as they 
operate within the security industry.

# 1 EVOLUTION OF THE CHANNEL
MEGATREND 1
Artificial intelligence (AI), cloud, technology upheaval, razor-thin margins, new competitors, 
changing requirements of end users: They’re all converging to create the most challenging 
wave of change the channel has ever seen, felt primarily in the systems integration channel.
The first challenge is the delivery model. As security devices become both more advanced 
and less expensive, system developers and providers are more often adopting a “direct to 
end user” model of sales. What’s more, these security-as-a-service (SaaS) models that often 
accompany such AI-enabled systems often do not connect the integrator to the recurring 
revenue stream, and that creates revenue problems for the integrator, says Bill Bozeman, 
a Megatrends advisor and chair of SIA’s AI Advisory Board. Bozeman emphasizes that 
“We have lived in a relatively static world where the risks were redefined periodically and the technology 
moved relatively slowly. That is just not the case anymore. We are now required to deliver solutions 
differently and respond more dynamically to evolving risks. We must be able to put solutions in place, 
leverage these emerging technologies quickly to address these risks and respond to the threats and 
incidents that occur in the environments that we all work to protect.”
– ERIC YUNAG, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, CONVERGINT, AT SECURING NEW GROUND (SNG) 2024
MEGATREND 
MOVEMENT
In both the Security 
Megatrends survey data 
and focus groups, there 
was no more important 
trend than the evolution of 
the channel, and it merged 
in and expanded beyond 
the 2024 Megatrend “SaaS 
Reshapes Integration 
Business Model” (ranked 
No. 6 in 2024).

integrators need to invest in their employee skills and their 
own technology and “what could help the integrator is if they 
were part of the revenue share.”
The second challenge is the evolving value proposition of 
the integrator for security end users/practitioners. In the 
past, an integrator’s key value to practitioners was their 
ability to connect otherwise non-homogeneous systems (i.e., 
different vendors’ platforms and devices) and make them 
available at command stations, remote desktops or even the 
security teams’ mobile phones. Today, however, that availability 
is expected directly from the security system, and the real 
value to the end user is the insights and automation that can 
happen in these systems. The value is inherent in the software 
itself (be it AI or “AI lite”), not in the configuration, and there 
is a risk of the integrator being relegated to installer if they 
cannot keep up with technologies.
The final (and continuous) challenge the integrator is facing 
is technological upheaval—particularly in the area of new 
AI-enabled solutions. Like the move to IP that occurred in 
the 2000s and flipped the security industry from an alarm/
low-voltage led industry to the network-focused industry of 
today, the wave of AI-enabled solutions coming to the market 
today is challenging the integrator to stay current on a suite 
of new technologies. This upheaval presents the need for new 
training and new skill sets in the integration workforce—which 
has already been challenged to hire technicians, engineers and 
other technical roles.
HOW THE MANUFACTURER CAN HELP
Systems integrators repeatedly recommend that manufacturers 
committed to supporting the channel react by providing integra-
tors with deeper training on their AI systems. This allows support 
and advanced configuration to continue to be handled by the 
integrator, rather than bearing that work in their own support 
and professional services teams. Otherwise, says Matthew Starr, 
Motorola’s government affairs director for privacy and AI, we’ll 
continue to see “a lot of edge AI not getting turned on.”

CONVERGING AND COMPETING
In this Venn diagram presented at the 2024 SNG conference by Eric Yunag, it’s easy to see the overlaps and possible redundancy 
that is creating competition among distributors, manufacturers and systems integrators over the “customer ownership.” But even 
though the model creates competition, the customer’s goals and solutions are still kept at the center of the mission.

TRENDS IMPACTING THE CHANNEL
NEW ENTRANTS
The pace of technological change has already begun to change the landscape of integration providers. 
Respondents to the SIA Security Megatrends survey indicated presence of “new entrants from IT, AV, 
datacom and electrical integrators,” and one executive wrote that “[as] physical security becomes more 
software-centric, large IT integrators and consultants (ex. PwC, Deloitte, EY) play a critical role in the 
buyer's journey and deployment experience.” There is also a move to IT distribution. Companies in the 
classic IT distribution sector (e.g., Ingram Micro) are moving huge amounts of “security” gear outside of 
the traditional distribution channel, and there is an emergence of a service competiveness inside this distribution channel. These 
firms provide kitting, programming, and hardening. “They have the muscle memory and scale to do what would be traditional 
integrator work,” says Yunag. In addition, companies like Google and Apple coming in with broad influence (see Megatrend No. 7 
“Democratization of Identity and Mobile Credentials.”) These megatech companies claim a fundamental layer of the new access 
control sector.

IMPACT ON THE PRACTITIONER
Rather than tell you what the practitioners are 
thinking, here we’ve let them tell you themselves:
“I’ve never had a technology DRI – a directly 
responsible individual. Who is the DRI for the 
technology from each integrator? They typically say 
their CTO, but the CTO manages their infrastructure. 
Who’s going to understand my tech stack, my 
problem? If you’re willing to embed an account 
manager on site, why can’t you assign a tech 
manager for me? It’s no longer about access control 
and cameras – it’s about the security systems we 
have, and no integrator seems to want to spend time 
understanding our problem as a whole.” 
– King Lam, corporate security, Apple
“As quickly as manufacturers are innovating, they 
need to make sure integrators are just as up to speed 
on what’s possible. We’d like them fully embedded in 
our teams so they understand our needs and wants. 
Manufacturers need to include integrators on their 
latest offerings, latest upgrades, etc., so they can be 
effective intermediaries.” 
– Shanel Balloo, senior manager, 
 
new technology and innovation, Salesforce

for engagement with the end user.

5 OPPORTUNITIES INTEGRATORS
Faced with the challenges, integration providers have opportunities to double down on customer needs, emphasize the 
“security” of being a security integrator and become ever more cognizant of the  business and the advanced security 
needs of their customers, the end users. These opportunities generally align with the following five areas:
EMBED TECHNICAL SECURITY TEAM MEMBERS 
WITH THEIR CLIENTS. 
Whether that’s on a full- or part-time basis, it allows the embedded 
team members to become more deeply skilled in the technical 
systems of their clients (and allows integration executives to focus 
team members’ training nearly exclusively on the systems they touch 
daily).
DELIVER TRUE MANAGED SERVICES. 
Offload the need to manage security systems from the end user and 
thus creating new recurring revenue opportunities for their own 
integration business. This allows the integrator to shift from the 
classic “construction” services model of implementation to a more 
sustainable business model of managed services.
SPECIALIZATION. 
One way to adapt to change and retain value is to specialize deeply in 
a strategic area – be that a vertical market, a technological alignment 
(e.g., identity services), or to even specialize and align deeply with a 
specific solution provider’s offerings. “We find the most successful 
channel partners know their area of expertise, and we can partner 
deeply with them on specific solutions to suit those needs,” explains 
Megatrend Advisor Devin Love, vice president of core platforms at 
Allegion. “The more specialized we become, the more value we can 
provide our clients,” said Yunag.
AGGREGATION OF INSIGHTS. 
As end users adopt more and more technologies, they struggle 
to get insights from these systems without having to access 
multiple system front ends. A business opportunity for the systems 
integrator is to embrace “platform aggregation” (#6 in the 2025 
Security Megatrends) and find ways to create more effective security 
and operational insights for their clients.
DEVELOP INTO A “MASTER SYSTEMS 
INTEGRATOR” ROLE. 
Take the lead in design, specification and management of all 
subsystems of a building and trained to effectively implement and 
configure advanced AI systems.

# 2 AI: INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION OF SECURITY
MEGATREND 
MOVEMENT
After sweeping the top 
four Megatrends in the 
2024 report, AI risked 
being overhyped. It was 
reassimilated to a single 
ranking, only edged out 
of the top position by the 
massive upheaval being 
felt by security integrators 
and other aspects of the 
channel.
“AI brings us to the next level. Not only do I see the door is open, but I also see if someone came in when 
they shouldn’t have, so we get more value out of that. Instead of making the PACS system the centerpiece 
to our stack, perhaps we should review and see if AI should be the centerpiece to our stack.” 
– PHIL JANG, CONVERGED SECURITY LEADER, TIKTOK USDS
Artificial intelligence, in spite of the risk of being overhyped by marketers, remains among the 
top drivers of the security industry’s future.
The consistent feedback from our Security Megatrends focus groups and in our survey 
completed by industry executives indicates that the greatest desires of AI for our industry 
are: 
- Create more efficiency in security operations
- Create actionable insights from the proliferation of sensor data and other data that is 
fed to security
- Be able to automate previously onerous security processes
Thus, in the coming years we believe that a more cautious optimism for AI in the security 
industry won’t be the application of general intelligence that replaces a human, but will be 
in its ability to intelligently automate repetitive business and security processes, allowing 
humans to do more in less time and with the right insights at their fingertips.
As Axis Communications’ Fredrik Nilsson noted at the 2024 SNG conference, approximately 
80% of the spend on security today is in manual labor, while in most other high-tech 
industries the labor costs are around 50%. “AI is the holy grail to capture that value with 
technology instead of manual labor,” espoused Nilsson.
13
securityIndustry.org  | 2025 SECURITY MEGATRENDS

Generative AI—as put into the spotlight by OpenAI/ChatGPT—
will not only be applied to basic business tasks but also help 
deliver training for security teams and identify possible 
data-backed risks and trends that are today being ignored 
unintentionally due to the mountains of alerts, notifications and 
surveillance captured.
APPLYING AI TO CUSTOMERS’ DATA
Drawing from our 2024 Security Megatrends report, “The 
Security of AI” (ranked first in 2024) and the “Regulation of AI” 
(ranked fourth in 2024) both retain their importance. But as 
customer data, or metadata, moves to cloud environments, 
solution developers can leverage that data to refine their 
engines, thus making future solutions more accurate and less 
expensive. As Eagle Eye Networks’ Tim Solomon challenged the 
industry at SNG 2024, however, solution providers must ensure 
they have customer permission to leverage this data in this 
manner, and they must do so in a way that puts data privacy at 
the forefront. 
IMPACT ON MONITORING
AI has the opportunity to significantly reduce false alarms, 
which is necessary for our industry because no matter how 
fast technology advances, if we don’t ease the burden on first 
responders or security team members, the alerts from our 
technologies will outpace their ability to respond.
“Security monitoring seems the most vulnerable to 
technological changes. Low-level alarm response can soon be 
accomplished solely by AI-based operators and automated 
response capabilities, which will change the business models of 
monitoring providers, decrease headcount, etc. The monitoring 
industry seems on the brink of a massive shift.” 
– Paul Rothman, editor, Security Business magazine
HOT TAKE
“I object to the term ‘artificial intelligence’ because it’s anything but. AI stands 
for ‘absolute ignorance,’ and the problem with using that term [AI] is we tend to 
anthropomorphize it. The things that humans do well – computers struggle with 
them. I like IA instead—‘intelligent automation’ —where you put a human in the 
loop to provide the judgment and creativity and let the computer do the heavy 
lifting. Tech can do a good job selecting candidates for the guard industry, but it 
also overlooks good candidates. There are losses of information, and the current 
technology we have can’t go beyond a line of knowledge. Humans can, but the tech 
we have today cannot. AI isn’t a description of the tech – it’s a description of the people using it. It makes 
people artificially more intelligent. If we rely on their decision making and the computer presents them 
with an option they don’t understand and they say ‘yes,’ it could be they’re signing on to something that’s 
contrary to what they wanted but they don’t know it. It’s a statistical inference engine, and ‘There’s lies, 
there’s damn lies and there’s statistic inference engines.’” 
– Pierre Racz, CEO, Genetec, speaking at SNG 2024

IMPACT ON THE PRACTITIONER
AI continues to hold great promise for the 
practitioner, and the most forward-thinking 
practitioners will adopt AI to improve their efficiency 
and unlock insights from the suites of IoT physical 
security systems they manage. They will use AI in 
ways that allow them to free their focus from rote 
tasks like clearing irrelevant notifications and spend 
more time doing deep work on real security risks.
IMPACT ON SECURITY STAFFING
Guards in more administrative roles will not be 
as needed, reducing the demand for “general 
duty” services and increasing demand for more 
specialized services. Concurrently, AI is poised to 
advance the effectiveness of remote guarding, 
alerting human teams of situational anomalies to 
focus their trained eyes.
Continued development and implementation 
of drone and robotic technology could eliminate 
human resources in the guard industry or allow 
these personnel to be retasked.
But for the near future, there exists a clear 
lack of comfort in turning over decision making to 
AI without a human in the loop to validate those 
decisions.
