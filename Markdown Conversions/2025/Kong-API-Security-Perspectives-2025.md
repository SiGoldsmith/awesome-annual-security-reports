## Executive Summary
83% of developers and business leaders said that AI investments had already created the opportunity for new products or services, according to Kong’s 2024 API Impact Report. But what are IT leaders concerned about in the year ahead? And what have they seen so far related to API security incidents and AI-enhanced threats? 
Our latest survey of 700 IT leaders reveals a critical inflection point in API security as organizations navigate the rising risk of AI-enhanced threats and the adoption of AI tools and large language models (LLMs).

Nearly 75% of respondents express serious concern about AI-enhanced attacks, but a notable disconnect emerged. While 55% of organizations experienced an API security incident in the past year, 85% say they’re confident in their organization’s security capabilities. This confidence may be misplaced, given 77% acknowledge the potential for significant security risks from AI and LLM integration into their API ecosystem. What’s more, the cost of API security incidents is substantial, with 20% reporting remediation costs exceeding $500,000 in the past 12 months.

Other key findings include:
- 40% are unsure their current security investments are sufficient to address emerging AI-related risks
- AI-enhanced cyberattacks are ranked as the top security threat
- 92% are taking measures to counter AI-enhanced threats
- Shadow APIs can be a dangerous blind spot for the majority of organizations

While organizations recognize the changing threat landscape, many lack the comprehensive security measures needed to protect their API infrastructure in the AI era. The gap between perception and reality requires attention, particularly as API attacks are projected to increase — and API breaches lead to more leaked data than the average security breach, Gartner reports.

Kong surveyed 700 IT leaders about API security and the rising risk of AI-enhanced threats.
AI-enhanced attacks top the list of the biggest perceived threats to API security today, followed by unauthorized access/breaches and insufficient data protection/encryption.
47% who experienced an API security incident in the past 12 months reported remediation costs of more than $100,000; 20% reported costs exceeding $500,000.
Leaders lack confidence in their ability to stop AI-enhanced threats
97% view API security as greater than or equal to other cybersecurity concerns, like network security and endpoint security.

## API security and the rising risk of AI-enhanced threats
AI-enhanced threats top list of potential security threats
AI can lower the barrier to entry for cyberattacks and provides another attack vector to potentially breach organizational defenses around API security. And because so many technologies rely on APIs, API attacks can have a growing impact on data security. 
Those working in tech clearly recognize the risk, with 74% saying they’re extremely or very concerned about AI-enhanced attacks, and 32% say they’re the single biggest security threat to organizations today. These types of attacks top the list of most significant threats to API security today, followed by unauthorized access or breaches.

74% are extremely or very concerned about AI-enhanced attacks
APIs (application programming interfaces) enable our digital world. There’s no AI without APIs, but even more basic online interactions like ordering pizza or public transit route planning are powered by APIs.
However, without proper management, visibility, and processes in place, APIs can be a potential hole in your security. 
Gartner reports the average API breach leads to at least 10 times more leaked data than the average security breach. And Kong forecasts API attacks are on the rise, projecting a 548% growth in the number of attacks by 2030. 
The rapid adoption of AI tech and large language models (LLMs) is leading to previously unfathomable innovation — but has also resulted in a total reshaping of the cybersecurity threat landscape. How are these new AI-enhanced tools and threats impacting API security? And what concerns do IT leaders have for the year ahead? 
To find out, we surveyed 700 IT leaders in the US and UK about AI’s role in the current API security landscape.

## Spotlighting the risk of shadow APIs
While shadow APIs may land lower on the list of perceived threats, these undiscovered and unmanaged APIs can pose massive security risks in organizations without an up-to-date system of record of services and APIs. As Gartner reports in the 2024 Market Guide for API Protection, “APIs — especially shadow and dormant ones — are causing data breaches among organizations that, on average, exceed the magnitude of other breaches.”
Gaining visibility into services and APIs is essential. Among the tens of thousands of API endpoints that may be running in an organization’s infrastructure, each can be thought of as a unique attack vector, especially if left unprotected without authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.

## There’s a surprising disconnect between confidence and the number of security incidents
Most view API security as a top cybersecurity concern
Despite the number of people who have recently experienced an attack — and dealt with the accompanying costs — most are confident in their ability to secure APIs against current and emerging threats. Is this a false sense of security, or have organizations buckled down after previous incidents? Only time will tell.
85% are confident in their in their ability to secure APIs
97% view API security as a cybersecurity concern greater than or relative to others, such as network security and endpoint security.
40% are unsure that their organization’s investment is enough
45% of people report more than 20% of their cybersecurity budget is dedicated to API security, and 40% are unsure or doubtful that their organization’s investment is enough to cover API security risks, especially in light of new AI projects and AI-enhanced threats. 40% are unsure their org’s investment is enough to cover API security risks

## Organizations rely on monitoring and API gateways to maintain control
When it comes to what preventative measures organizations are taking to mitigate API security risks, API monitoring and anomaly detection tools top the list. Comparing the UK and the US, UK respondents are more likely to report implementing an API gateway — 71% in the UK vs 50% in the US. This difference may be due to greater compliance and regulatory requirements in the UK.
Only 35% report adopting zero-trust architecture, surprising given how established and generally accepted as best practice this comprehensive approach to API security is.
92% are taking measures to secure APIs against AI-enhanced threats
Increased monitoring and traffic analysis top the list of measures organizations are taking to secure APIs against AI-enhanced threats. There’s a notable difference between how seriously organizations in the UK and the US seem to consider AI-enhanced threats: 13% in the US say they’re taking no specific measures for AI threats compared to only 4% in the UK.

## AI models and LLMs complicate security, introduce vulnerabilities
77% say there’s a significant risk that AI models such as LLMs may introduce security vulnerabilities when integrated into their API ecosystem.
As AI usage increases within organizations, it will be crucial to block external AI-enhanced attacks and properly govern and secure AI-generated traffic resulting from new initiatives. To mitigate these risks, IT leaders report implementing AI-specific security policies, adopting an AI gateway, and enhancing monitoring and anomaly detection for AI traffic.
An AI gateway is a central place to manage AI consumption that can be used to accelerate adoption of AI without compromising on observability, security, and governance.

## Securely implementing AI and the weakest link
Humans remain one of the weakest points in cybersecurity, so investing energy into education about best practices around GenAI and LLMs is wise. But education alone is not enough. While most organizations have AI guidelines or regulations in place, 60% of people report they ignore or find ways to work around their organization’s AI-usage rules.
To make the most of the opportunities these technologies present, organizations must figure out how to address the challenges that come with them — like what they means for data governance or regulations. A well-defined, robust governance playbook for responsible adoption is key.
