## Executive Summary
The 2025 Global State of API Security Report, our second annual study, provides a comprehensive analysis of the escalating security challenges associated with APIs across industries like technology, financial services, healthcare, and retail. Drawing on insights from 1,548 IT and security professionals worldwide, this report uncovers critical vulnerabilities, attack trends, and emerging risks impacting enterprise organizations.

This year’s findings reveal that 57% of organizations reported at least one data breach caused by API exploitation in the past two years. Despite these breaches, organizations are still testing only 38% of their APIs for vulnerabilities on average, with a low confidence level—companies estimate they can only prevent 24% of API-related attacks. This underscores the need for more robust and comprehensive API security measures, especially as 61% of organizations expect API risk to increase or significantly increase over the next 12 to 24 months.

A significant challenge highlighted is preventing API sprawl, with 54% of respondents stating difficulty in managing and controlling the expansion of APIs in their environments. This lack of control makes it increasingly challenging for organizations to protect their systems and data.

DDoS and fraud remain the top methods of API exploitation, revealing the limitations of traditional security solutions. While many organizations deploy tools like web application firewalls (WAFs) and web application and API protection (WAAP) platforms, these measures are often ineffective. The data indicates that these approaches frequently fall short in mitigating threats, prompting enterprises to reassess their strategies.

New to this year’s report is a focus on the security challenges associated with generative AI applications. As 67% of organizations are adopting generative AI, risks have multiplied. Concerns include expanded attack surfaces (60%), potential data exfiltration (60%), and unauthorized access (60%). Furthermore, 66% of respondents cite a lack of in-house expertise in securing generative AI APIs, emphasizing the need for specialized knowledge and solutions.

Reasons why APIs are at risk

![Image description: A bar graph comparing 2023 and 2025 data on why APIs are a security risk. The graph shows the following: API are a security risk because they expand the attack surface across all layers of the technology stack (58% in 2023, 57% in 2025), Traditional security solutions are not effective in distinguishing legitimate from fraudulent activity at the API layer (53% in 2023, 55% in 2025), The volume of APIs make it difficult to prevent attacks (53% in 2023, 55% in 2025).]

## Key Findings
Organizations are having multiple data breaches caused by an API exploitation in the past two years, which results in financial and IP losses. These data breaches are likely to occur because on average only 38 percent of APIs are continually tested for vulnerabilities. As a result, organizations are only confident in preventing an average of 24 percent of attacks. To prevent API compromises, APIs should be monitored for risky traffic performance and errors.

Targeted DDoS attacks continue to be the primary root cause of the data breaches caused by an API exploitation. Another root cause is fraud, abuse and misuse. When asked to rate the seriousness of fraud attacks, almost half of respondents (47 percent) say these attacks are very or highly serious.

Organizations have a very difficult time discovering and inventorying all APIs and as a result they do not know the extent of risks to their APIs. Many APIs are being created and updated so organizations can quickly lose control of the numerous types of APIs used and provided. Once all APIs are discovered it is important to have an inventory that provides visibility into the nature and behavior of those APIs.

According to the research, the areas that are most challenging to securing APIs and should be made a focus of any security strategy are preventing API sprawl, stopping the growth in API security vulnerabilities and prioritizing APIs for remediation.

Third-party APIs expose organizations to cybersecurity risks. In this year’s research, an average of 131 third parties are connected to organizations’ APIs. Recommendations to mitigate third-party API risk include creating an inventory of third-party APIs, performing risk assessments and due diligence and establishing ongoing monitoring and testing. Third-party APIs should also be continuously analyzed for misconfiguration and vulnerabilities.

To prevent API exploitations, organizations need to make identifying API endpoints that handle sensitive data without appropriate authentication more of a priority. An API endpoint is a specific location within an API that accepts requests and sends back responses. It’s a way for different systems and applications to communicate with each other, by sending and receiving information and instructions via the endpoint.

It’s a way for different systems and applications to communicate with each other, by sending and receiving information and instructions via the endpoint.

A bot is a software program that operates on the Internet and performs repetitive tasks. While some bot traffic is from good bots, bad bots can have a huge negative impact on APIs. Fifty-three percent of respondents say their organizations experienced one or more bot attacks involving APIs. The security solutions most often used to reduce the risk from bot attacks are web application firewalls, content delivery network deployment and active traffic monitoring on an API endpoint.

## Top Findings At a Glance Continued...
Generative artificial intelligence is being adopted by many organizations for its many benefits such as in business intelligence, content development and coding. In this research, 67 percent of respondents say their organizations have currently adopted (21 percent), in the process of adopting (30 percent) or plan to adopt generative AI in the next year (16 percent). As organizations embrace generative AI they should also be aware of the security risks that negatively affect APIs.

The top concerns about how generative AI applications affect API security are the increased attack surface due to additional API integrations, unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential data leakage through API calls to generative AI services and difficulty in monitoring and analyzing traffic to and from generative AI APIs.

The main challenges in securing APIs used by generative AI applications are the rapid pace of generative AI technology development, lack of in-house expertise in generative AI and API security and the lack of established best practices for securing generative AI API.

The top priorities for securing APIs used by generative AI applications are real-time monitoring and analysis of traffic to and from generative AI APIs, implementing strong authentication and authorization for generative AI API calls and comprehensive discovery and cataloging of generative AI API integrations.

Organizations invest in API security for generative AI-based applications and APIs to be able to identify and block sensitive data flows to generative AI APIs and safeguard critical data assets, improve efficiency of technologies and staff and real time monitoring and analysis of traffic to and from LLM APIs to quickly detect and respond to emerging threats.

This chapter discusses the root causes of these breaches, examining the methods most commonly exploited by attackers, such as DDoS, fraud, and brute force attacks. It also highlights the persistent challenges organizations face in detecting and mitigating these threats, emphasizing the urgent need for more effective API security strategies.

![Image description: A bar graph comparing 2023 and 2025 data on the number of data breaches caused by API exploitation. The graph shows the following: 1 or 2 breaches (20% in 2023, 22% in 2025), 3 or 4 breaches (7% in 2023, 6% in 2025), 5 or 6 breaches (12% in 2023, 14% in 2025), 6 or 7 breaches (11% in 2023, 13% in 2025), > 7 breaches (17% in 2023, 34% in 2025), Unknown (32% in 2023, 32% in 2025).]

This year’s survey shows that 57% of organizations experienced at least one data breach caused by an API exploitation in the past two years, underscoring the ongoing risk that APIs present. The distribution of these incidents reveals both stability and shifts in the number of breaches organizations face. While 1 to 2 breaches were reported by 22% of respondents (up from 20% in 2023), the percentage of those experiencing 6 to 7 breaches rose from 12% to 14%, and those reporting more than 7 breaches increased from 11% to 13%.

These shifts suggest that while some organizations may have experienced fewer incidents, a significant number continue to face multiple API-related data breaches. This indicates that API security remains a complex and ongoing challenge, requiring careful attention from security teams.

> 57% of organizations experienced an API-related data breach in the past two years. Of those that experienced a breach, 73% had at least three API-related breaches.

How many data breaches did your organization have that were caused by an API exploitation in the past two years?

DDoS and Fraud Continue to be the Primary Breach Method; Brute Force Enters the Top 3.

The data presents a multifaceted landscape of the root causes behind data breaches, painting a picture of the complex challenges organizations face in today's digital environment. Leading the charge are DDoS attacks, reported by a significant 38% of respondents. Such attacks, which flood systems with traffic to cause service interruptions, demonstrate the pressing need for organizations to bolster their defenses against volumetric threats.

Equally concerning is the fact that both known attacks, which have established signatures, and fraud, abuse, and misuse were cited by 29% of participants. This highlights a dual challenge: while organizations are struggling to fend off threats they should theoretically be prepared for, they're also wrestling with deceptive activities that might slip under traditional security radars.

![Image description: A bar graph comparing 2023 and 2025 data on the root causes of data breaches.

It may reflect a highly digital-first business model, perhaps even a platform-based approach. While the flexibility and scalability offered by such a vast number of APIs are evident, so are the security challenges. The larger and more varied the API network, the more potential entry points for cyber threats.
16% operate with over 2,500 APIs (up from 13% in 2023), indicative of vast enterprises with intricate digital touch points.
6% still lack clarity on their API count, signaling lack of visibility and potential security blind spots.

![Image description: A bar graph comparing 2023 and 2025 data on the number of APIs used by organizations. The graph shows the following: Less than 100 (8% in 2023, 9% in 2025), 100 to 250 (11% in 2023, 10% in 2025), 251 to 500 (19% in 2023, 19% in 2025), 501 to 1,000 (20% in 2023, 20% in 2025), 1,001 to 2,500 (13% in 2023, 16% in 2025), More than 2,500 (19% in 2023, 19% in 2025), Do not know (6% in 2023, 6% in 2025).]

Recent data unveils that organizations are widely using a range of APIs, and it’s largely unchanged from the previous year - from Open APIs at 33%, Public APIs at 31%, to Private APIs at 30%. Additionally, Partner APIs (25%), Composite APIs (17%), Internal APIs (25%), and Third-party APIs (15%) also find their place in the organizational framework.

The assortment of API types in modern organizations highlights their intricate digital ecosystems:
*   **Breadth of Integration Points**: The prevalence of Open APIs (33%), Public APIs (31%), and Private APIs (30%) underscores the various integration points businesses operate with. Open and Public APIs often indicate external partnerships or services offered to a broader audience, while Private APIs are crucial for internal processes, linking various systems within an enterprise.
*   **Collaborative Ventures**: The utilization of Partner APIs (25%) suggests that a significant number of organizations are involved in collaborative ventures, relying on shared services or data to deliver value to their end-users. Such collaborations, while fruitful, can introduce additional vectors for vulnerabilities if not managed judiciously.
*   **Internal Workflows and Flexibility**: The use of Internal APIs (25%) and Composite APIs (17%) points towards the inclination of businesses to streamline their internal workflows and create flexible systems that can adapt to changing business needs. Composite APIs, which allow multiple data and service calls to be combined, demonstrate the push for efficiency in system design.
*   **Reliance on Third Parties**: The 15% usage of Third-party APIs reveals an external dependency wherein businesses leverage outside platforms or tools. This reliance can be for augmenting functionality, enhancing service offerings, or simplifying certain processes. However, it also means organizations are entrusting a portion of their operations, and potentially their data, to external entities, necessitating rigorous security scrutiny.
*   **A Spectrum of Trust**: The differentiation between Public, Private, and Partner APIs inherently indicates levels of trust. Public APIs are exposed to a wider audience, perhaps with limited access to certain functionalities. In contrast, Private APIs are often closely guarded. Meanwhile, Partner APIs represent a middle ground, where access is granted based on collaborative agreements.

Diverse API Types and Their Implications for Security

![Image description: A bar graph comparing 2023 and 2025 data on the types of APIs used by organizations. The graph shows the following: Open APIs (32% in 2023, 33% in 2025), Public APIs (31% in 2023, 31% in 2025), Private APIs (30% in 2023, 30% in 2025), Partner APIs (22% in 2023, 25% in 2025), Internal APIs (20% in 2023, 25% in 2025), Composite APIs (21% in 2023, 17% in 2025), Third-Party APIs (15% in 2023, 15% in 2025).]

What types of APIs does your organization use and/or provide?

![Image description: A bar graph comparing 2023 and 2025 data on why APIs are a security risk. The graph shows the following: API are a security risk because they expand the attack surface across all layers of the technology stack (58% in 2023, 54% in 2025), Traditional security solutions are not effective in distinguishing legitimate from fraudulent activity at the API layer (53% in 2023, 57% in 2025), The volume of APIs make it difficult to prevent attacks (55% in 2023, 56% in 2025).]

Over half of the respondents (56%) echo the sentiment that the sheer volume of APIs makes it difficult to prevent attacks. As shown below, APIs' capacity to expand the attack surface across all layers of the technology stack is seen as a significant risk by a total of 58% of respondents, who either strongly agree or agree with the statement.

Fifty-seven percent of respondents say traditional security solutions are not effective in distinguishing legitimate from fraudulent activity at the API layer. The increasing number and complexity of APIs makes it difficult to track how many APIs exist, where they are located and what they are doing. As a result, 56 percent of respondents say the volume of APIs makes it difficult to prevent attacks.
This finding underscores the need for new, effective security methodologies and solutions tailored for API protection.

It’s clear that the API threat landscape is set to intensify. A substantial 61% of respondents anticipate that API risks will either significantly increase or increase over the next 12 to 24 months. Despite APIs' pivotal role, organizations struggle with significant challenges in securing them. Over half of respondents (54%) highlight preventing API sprawl as a top issue, while maintaining an accurate API inventory and prioritizing APIs for remediation, also emerged as considerable hurdles.

Persistent Reliance on Ineffective API Security Solutions

Despite the growing complexity of API threats, organizations continue to rely on the same traditional security solutions, even as their effectiveness remains questionable. Only 19% of respondents rate their API security solutions as "highly effective" (scores of 9 or 10).
The majority of organizations express far less confidence: 34% rate their tools as merely moderate (scores of 5 or 6), indicating ambivalence about their effectiveness.

![Image description: A bar graph showing the effectiveness of API security solutions. The graph shows the following: 1 or 2 (13%), 3 or 4 (10%), 5 or 6 (34%), 7 or 8 (19%), 9 or 10 (19%).]

Please rate how effective the solutions your organization uses to achieve API security from 1 = not effective to 10 = highly effective.

These numbers reveal a critical gap between the perceived need for API security and the actual performance of the solutions being deployed. As threats continue to evolve, the industry’s reliance on outdated measures leaves organizations vulnerable, underscoring the urgent need for innovation in securing the API layer.

API Attack Protection: Gaps in Detection and Prevention

Organizations continue to face significant gaps in their ability to detect and prevent API attacks. Only 21% of respondents rate their detection capabilities as high (9 or 10), while 28% report moderate effectiveness (7 or 8), and 28% fall on the low end (1-4). These figures highlight the limited monitoring and response capabilities at the API layer.

In terms of prevention, only 13% of organizations can prevent more than half of API attacks—a number unchanged from last year. The majority are unable to block even 20% of attacks, with 19% preventing just 11-15%. This stagnation underscores the need for improved tools and strategies to secure API environments and address the evolving threat landscape.

![Image description: A bar graph showing the ability of organizations to detect attacks at the API layer. The graph shows the following: 1 or 2 (9%), 3 or 4 (19%), 5 or 6 (21%), 7 or 8 (28%), 9 or 10 (21%).]

## Part III: The Escalating Threat of Bot Attacks on APIs
APIs are a growing target for bot attacks, which can disrupt services, steal data, and compromise systems. The 2025 Global State of API Security Report highlights the increasing prevalence of these attacks and the ongoing struggle organizations face in effectively mitigating them.

APIs are a growing target for bot attacks, which can disrupt services, steal data, and compromise systems. The 2025 Global State of API Security Report highlights the increasing prevalence of these attacks and the ongoing struggle organizations face in effectively mitigating them.

> 53% of organizations reporting at least one bot-related incident targeting their APIs

Bot attacks represent a growing challenge in the API security landscape, with 53% of organizations reporting at least one bot-related incident targeting their APIs. This prevalence underscores the persistent and evolving nature of the threat. Notably, 44% of organizations cite bot attacks as a significant obstacle in securing their API environments, indicating that many businesses struggle to manage these attacks effectively.

Despite awareness of the issue, only 21% of organizations describe their ability to mitigate bot traffic as “high.” This suggests a gap between the recognition of the threat and the effectiveness of the measures currently in place.

Organizations are deploying a range of tools to combat bot attacks, but the results are mixed. The most commonly used solutions include web application firewalls (WAFs), deployed by 52% of organizations, and content delivery networks (CDNs), used by 49%. These tools are designed to filter and block malicious traffic, but their efficacy in the context of API-specific threats is limited. Active traffic monitoring, employed by 48% of organizations, helps track API endpoint activity, providing real-time data that can be valuable in detecting and responding to attacks.

API rate limiting, a strategy implemented by 42%, and assertive rate-limiting policies (used by 33%) are additional methods aimed at curbing the frequency and volume of API calls, effectively reducing the attack surface. However, these measures, while helpful, are not sufficient on their own. The variety of tools and strategies deployed reflects an industry grappling with a complex issue, yet the lack of a unified, high-confidence approach indicates that many organizations remain vulnerable.

The findings highlight a critical need for more advanced, integrated solutions that can proactively identify and respond to bot traffic. As bot attacks grow in sophistication, organizations must move beyond reactive measures and develop robust, coordinated strategies to secure their APIs effectively.
