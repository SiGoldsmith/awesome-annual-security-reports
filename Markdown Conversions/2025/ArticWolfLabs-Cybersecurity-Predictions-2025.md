# Introduction
About Arctic Wolf® Labs
Arctic Wolf Labs is a group of elite security researchers, data scientists, and security development engineers 
who explore security topics to deliver cutting-edge threat research on new and emerging adversaries, develop 
and refine advanced threat detection models with artificial intelligence, including machine learning, and drive 
continuous improvement in the speed, scale, and detection efficacy of Arctic Wolf’s solution offerings.
With their deep domain knowledge, Arctic Wolf Labs brings world-class security innovations to not only 
Arctic Wolf’s customer base, but the security community-at-large.

## Adaptability and Opportunism in 2025
Looking ahead to 2025, we believe two forces will exert a significant influence on tomorrow’s threat 
landscape: adversaries’ ability and willingness to adapt, and their propensity for financial gain. Unencumbered 
by laws, certain ethical standards, or institutional inertia, attackers of all types — from nation-state agencies, 
to ransomware groups, to hacktivists, to individuals — benefit from an opportunistic advantage and 
nimbleness of execution that defenders may lack. Closely related, threat actors perceive the world through 
a lens of opportunity. With this outlook, practically any new technology, or emerging crisis, or change in IT 
architectures — to list just a few circumstances — can be leveraged.
Against this backdrop, our specific observations lead to our five core predictions for 2025:
These predictions are the work of several of our brightest minds who aim to prepare security teams for 
the challenges of the year ahead to mitigate the risks posed by threat actor activity. It is also important to 
note that these listed predictions highlight areas of concern but are not presented in a ranked or hierarchal 
format. We suggest determining the priority of each topic based on the specifics of your environment.
Many organizations will see a continued breakdown of their perimeter defense as threat actors 
target VPN gateways and other edge devices.

## 01
Malicious actors will continue to refine their social engineering methods, creating opportunities 
for large-scale campaigns.

## 02
Ransomware attacks will increasingly exploit weaknesses in identity and access management 
(IAM) configurations.

## 03
Critical infrastructure will continue to be targeted, both for extortion and to prepare the digital 
battlefield for potential hybrid conflicts.

## 04
The widespread availability of advanced AI reasoning will allow threat actors to rapidly uncover 
novel initial access techniques.

# 01
Defense in depth — with multiple layers contributing 
unique capabilities and adding redundancy — has 
always been a stalwart of enterprise security.

## The Only Constant Is Change
For both technical and psychological reasons, 
perimeter defenses would likely top past surveys 
about the relative importance of different layers. 
However, the past few years have brought 
considerable change as multiple trends converged.
First, enterprise perimeters themselves have 
transformed. From IoT devices and cloud 
infrastructure to customer-facing applications and 
many other interface points, today’s perimeters 
bear little resemblance to those of even the recent 
past — and one result of this transformation is a 
vastly expanded attack surface.
Second, the adoption of remote work has imposed 
new requirements and introduced new challenges 
that influence perimeter architectures and 
tooling. Even as return-to-office (RTO) initiatives 
draw some workers back, extended and partially 
remote workforces remain common. To enable 
and accommodate this new operational reality, 
organizations introduced and continue to refine 
their tooling, including VPN gateways and zero 
trust network access (ZTNA) tools.
Third, threat actors have adjusted their tactics, 
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to — as is 
always the case — take advantage of these shifts.
More edge devices and services mean more 
configurations to harden and vulnerabilities to 
patch, with any mistake or delay creating an 
opportunity for an attacker to gain initial access. 
Of course, more edge devices and services also 
mean a higher exposure to zero-day vulnerabilities.

## Turning the Tables
Threat actors have also had considerable success 
attacking the very tools organizations rely upon 
for enabling remote work.
For instance, the rapid introduction of VPN 
gateways, and the rearchitecting that often 
accompanied their rollout, led to misconfigurations 
that adversaries are quick to discover.
But more significantly, even solid implementations 
can give a false sense of security. For example, 
2024 saw widespread exploitation of software 
vulnerabilities within VPN gateways (e.g., Palo 
Alto Networks, SonicWall), necessitating a 
coordinated response between security service 
providers, the appliance vendors, and end 
customers to remediate. We must be cautious to 
not overlook that all networked devices, including 
security appliances, run software and all software 
has the potential for flaws or misconfiguration. 
Additionally, adversaries frequently leverage stolen 
credentials to turn an otherwise secure gateway 
into a convenient means of surreptitiously 
accessing the enterprise environment. 
Organizations Will See a Continued Breakdown 
of Their Perimeter Defense as Threat Actors 
Target VPN Gateways and Other Edge Devices

Once the cornerstone of a strong cybersecurity posture, the perimeter has undergone 
unprecedented transformation in recent years — resulting in both a larger attack surface 
and a plethora of remote access tools that threat actors are eager to exploit.

In organizations that permit working from 
home (or elsewhere), a large percentage of the 
workforce may have remote access — increasing 
the chances that a set of compromised credentials 
can be used to access protected IT environment. 
When threat actors successfully penetrate VPN 
devices, there can be a very quick turnaround 
from initial access to acting on objectives — as 
seen with Akira affiliates taking less than two 
hours to exploit a SonicWall vulnerability and 
detonate ransomware.
Yet VPN gateways are not the only devices at 
risk. Other on-prem perimeter devices such as 
IP cameras, VoIP devices, industrial IoT gateways, 
medical devices, and others have the same 
potential to be leveraged by malicious actors 
to conduct attacks. This highlights the need for 
a detailed inventory of your environment and 
continuous monitoring to identify such threats. 

## Manufacturers Beware…
Although this threat is not limited to any 
specific industry, we have observed a 
significant impact in manufacturing.
For example, a recent ransomware threat 
event involving SonicWall SSL VPN access 
affected a wide variety of industries — 
but manufacturing represented 32% 
of all intrusions investigated. Similar 
disproportionality was observed in 2024 
Arctic Wolf Incident Response case 
data, with the manufacturing industry 
representing 44% of all cases investigated.

## Every Organization Is at Risk
Because every connected, digital organization has a 
perimeter — even as the exact composition of edge devices 
and services, and remote connectivity gateways varies — 
these attacks aren’t limited to any specific industry.
Moreover, they’re not necessarily limited to any particular 
attack type — although ransomware deployment, 
cryptocurrency mining, industrial espionage, and 
data theft are common attacker objectives.
That said, comparatively smaller organizations may have 
allocated fewer resources into network segmentation 
and other safeguards, which can make them seem like 
easier prey. In 2024 we witnessed an increase in small- 
to medium-sized organizations being exploited 
in opportunistic ransomware attacks (e.g., Fog
and Akira affiliates).

## Recommendations
- Ensure network and endpoint logs are available for examination and correlation — visibility 
into initial exploitation can be limited, making such telemetry especially important for 
identifying potential intrusions as quickly as possible.
- Train the workforce on credential hygiene best practices and consider subscribing to a threat 
intelligence service that includes monitoring of credential dumps.
- Reduce the blast radius of compromised accounts and devices by using network segmentation 
to help prevent unauthorized users from accessing specific network-connected resources and 
to create micro-perimeters around critical assets and network components.
- Implement a vulnerability management program that prioritizes continuous vulnerability 
remediation and assessment, with other components of the program complementing and 
assisting overall remediation and mitigation.
- Subscribe to security bulletins and incorporate their recommendations into your regular 
security operations.
- Pay special attention to securing Internet of Things (IoT) devices — these devices often come with 
little or no baked-in security, and can often be quickly forgotten once installed in your environment.

Adversaries Will Continue To Create and Leverage 
Opportunities for Large-Scale Social Engineering 
Campaigns, While Incorporating New TTPs
Even as organizations invest heavily in technological 
defenses, one extremely fallible element remains: 
the humans who make up the employees, 
contractors, vendors, and other third parties 
comprising the modern extended workforce.
For a threat actor launching a multi-phase 
attack, it can be easier and more efficient to 
use social engineering to bypass defenses than 
to employ technological means. After all, it only 
takes one mistake from one person to unwittingly 
open the door.
>“Never let a good crisis go to waste.” 
- Winston Churchill

We regularly see threat actors immediately 
spring into action when disaster strikes, hoping 
to exploit the desperation and chaos that follows. 
The past year provided attackers with two 
prime opportunities: 
- CrowdStrike’s infamous update-gone-wrong, 
which led to widespread IT outages
- CDK’s global downtime following a 
ransomware attack
In both cases, we observed phishing campaigns 
targeting impacted parties — often dangling 
service restoration as a lure.
Unfortunately, there’s no reason to think attackers 
will abandon such effective approaches. 
If something big happens in 2025, it’s a safe bet 
that social engineering campaigns will be crafted 
and launched within hours.
We may even see two-stage attacks in which a 
threat actor first disrupts a major player, and then 
immediately launches campaigns to take advantage 
of the resulting chaos.

## Don’t Believe Everything You See and Hear
Compounding the threat, generative AI is lowering 
the bar to entry for crafting convincing messaging 
and creating deepfakes that increase the 
effectiveness of phishing attacks.
Voice phishing (or vishing), in particular, is growing 
as a threat, with adversaries masquerading as 
employees and targeting call centers, help desks, 
and other departments that interact remotely 
and can grant access (e.g., via password recovery/
reset flows). Plus, even live video feeds can be 
manipulated to make attackers look and sound 
like legitimate employees. Today’s deepfake tools 
require only a few still photographs — which are 
easily sourced from LinkedIn or a team member’s 
public social media presence.
Without a reliable mechanism for remote identity 
verification — security questions don’t count, 
but offline hardware keys do — anyone providing 
remote assistance will remain an attractive target.

Social engineering offers a cheap and effective way for threat actors to bypass technological 
defenses, and new tools — particularly generative AI — make it even easier to execute even more 
effective attacks.

## Recommendations
- Educate users about phishing and conduct phishing attack simulation — create a culture of security 
awareness that forgoes assigning blame to encourage individual accountability.
- Implement email controls as a defensive layer: restrict external email inbound, add headers to emails 
to warn users when external inbound emails arrive, and use email security products from vendors like 
Mimecast or Barracuda.
- Implement and enforce modern, phishing-resistant MFA.
- Reduce the blast radius of compromised accounts and devices through network segmentation and 
least-privilege access controls.
- In addition to network (for phishing lures) and endpoint (for post-compromise activity) telemetry, ensure 
SaaS logs (e.g., Microsoft 365, Microsoft Entra, Okta, Duo) are available for examination and correlation.
- Where possible and practical, consider limiting your exposure to outages and other disruptions by 
employing a multi-vendor strategy.
- Incorporate third-party outages into your disaster recovery planning.
- As part of the due diligence process when evaluating potential third-party vendors and service providers, 
pay particular attention to their continuity and recovery plans, and compliance certifications.
Looking beyond phishing, in 2024 we witnessed a historic campaign of high sophistication targeting the 
XZ Utils project. This episode was likely conducted by a nation state-affiliated group, and is an example of 
social engineering playing out over a longer term.

## MFA Implementation Details Matter
In response to heightened awareness of phishing, many organizations have deployed multi-factor 
authentication (MFA). However, it’s important to note that MFA — while immensely valuable — 
isn’t a panacea.
Threat actors are executing adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) attacks and employing MFA fatigue 
against organizations with MFA enabled. As an example, Arctic Wolf observed widespread 
exploitation of the Axios phishing campaign which leveraged AiTM techniques.
Correct configurations should render these types of attacks impossible, but reaching that state 
often requires specialized expertise and modern MFA techniques like those employing the 
WebAuthn/FIDO2 phishing-resistant standards.

# 03
Identity and access management (IAM) systems 
are essential elements of the modern enterprise 
technology stack. Among other functions, IAM 
infrastructure provides:
- Authentication, to establish with confidence 
that entities — primarily employees, systems, 
and devices —are who they say they are
- Authorization, to enable the appropriate 
level of access to privileges, resources, 
applications (etc.)
- Identity management, to enable users, 
administrators, and systems to make 
updates and changes to identity data 
and related information

## Of Details and Perceived Trade-Offs…
However, identity is a specialized and challenging 
domain, and even the use of an IAM system 
is no guarantee against errors. The results of 
these errors — including overprivileged access, 
orphaned accounts, and shadow directories — can 
be exploited to gain unauthorized access to 
systems and resources.
Plus, security objectives often run up against 
productivity needs. Safeguards are intended to 
prevent unauthorized access, but too much friction 
for users can impede their ability to do their jobs. In 
many cases, such perceived trade-offs force IT to 
soften security measures or maintain workarounds 
— even when the risks of doing so are known.
As if the situation wasn’t complicated enough, 
Active Directory (AD) configurations are not 
specifically designed to be “secure by default.” This 
could lead to multiple opportunities for detrimental 
misconfigurations that require updating or 
modifying. Unfortunately, making changes to 
authentication infrastructure can be disruptive to 
end users, causing needed upgrades/migrations 
to fall behind. For example, on-premises Active 
Directory infrastructure often lags behind other 
high priority work and remains operational longer 
than it should, even with versions of Windows that 
have reached end-of-life (EoL) status.

## Infostealers and Credential Abuse
Naturally, threat actors are all too willing and able 
to take advantage of any weakness, vulnerability, 
or misconfiguration in identity infrastructure 
— including in MFA implementations (as noted 
previously). In particular, the use of infostealers 
to acquire credentials or active session cookies 
and the subsequent reuse of those credentials 
and cookies are major threats.
To put the risk in perspective, Verizon’s 2024 
Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 
indicates that over 80% of breaches involve 
compromised identity. In practice, this can mean 
gaining initial access or performing intrusion 
actions like reconnaissance, privilege escalation, 
and establishing persistence.
Ransomware and Other Attacks Will 
Increasingly Exploit Weaknesses in Identity 
and Access Management (IAM) Configurations
Identity has rapidly risen to prominence as one of the most important and complicated 
cybersecurity domains — unfortunately, misconfigurations and permissive policies 
play right into the hands of ransomware affiliates and other threat actors.

We often observe that VPN credentials serve as 
the root point of compromise in our Arctic Wolf 
Incident Response cases. In 2024 we saw affiliates 
with Akira and Fog ransomware opportunistically 
exploiting SSL VPN accounts without MFA enabled.
While the wider identity industry is taking steps 
to help strengthen and standardize defenses — 
including the establishment in September 2024 of 
the Interoperability Profiling for Secure Identity in 
the Enterprise (IPSIE) Working Group — we expect 
threat actors to have success exploiting IAM 
configurations well into the foreseeable future.

## Why Break in When You Have 
the Keys?
With good reason, many security leaders 
are especially concerned about zero-
day exploits. However, while potentially 
devastating and definitely headline-
grabbing, such attacks represent a 
small fraction of overall incidents.
In contrast, the use of stolen credentials 
and general exploitation of poor credential 
hygiene are much more common — 
despite contributing to intrusions that can 
be considerably more difficult to detect.
Technologists are primed to pay particular 
attention to sophisticated attack vectors, 
but threat actors are all too willing to take 
advantage of misdirected vigilance by 
employing more mundane TTPs.

## Recommendations
- Work with your IAM and application providers to strengthen your defenses against account takeovers 
(ATOs) and — more generally — to enforce strong credential controls and phishing-resistant MFA.
- Block authentication attempts from hosting-based traffic — this may be extended to include proxies 
and anonymization services, which criminals also use to hide their origins.
- Set automated blocking on authentication attempts to hinder password-spraying activities, and 
implement geolocation-based blocking (e.g., restricted countries, impossible travel scenarios).
- Configure syslog to forward your organization’s VPN and firewall logs to your security operations provider.
- Implement network segmentation to limit the ability of threat actors to move laterally.
- Ensure telemetry from on-premises (e.g., Active Directory) and SaaS authentication providers 
(e.g., Microsoft 365, Microsoft Entra, Okta, Duo, etc.), and endpoints (for post-compromise activity) 
is available for examination and correlation.

Critical Infrastructure Will Continue To Be 
Targeted, Both for Financial Gain and in 
Preparation for Potential Hybrid Conflicts

## Critical Infrastructure Is Under Attack
Issued in February 2013 by the Obama 
administration, Presidential Policy Directive 
21 (PPD-21) designates 16 sectors as “critical 
infrastructure.”
As the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security 
Agency (CISA) explains, these are sectors “whose 
assets, systems, and networks, whether physical 
or virtual, are considered so vital to the United 
States that their incapacitation or destruction 
would have a debilitating effect on security, 
national economic security, national public 
health or safety, or any combination thereof.”
Although companies and other organizations within 
these sectors always face cyber threats, 2024 saw 
an increase in threat activity against a subset. 
For example:
- Among a string of incidents in the Water 
and Wastewater Systems sector, the largest 
wastewater company in the US was attacked 
in October
- As reported by Check Point, the Energy sector 
endured a 70% year-over-year increase in 
attacks against utilities
- Sophos noted a four-year high in ransomware 
attacks against Healthcare and Public Health 
organizations, with surveys suggesting two-
thirds of such organizations were impacted
- In February, a joint statement issued by CISA, 
the FBI, and the NSA warned that the People’s 
Republic of China was seeking to pre-position 
itself on U.S. communications networks in case 
of a conflict with the U.S.
Many of the attacks followed the typical 
ransomware playbook of disrupting operations 
and exfiltrating data to extort a payment. 
However, there’s suspicion among the 
cybersecurity community that some of these 
incidents may have also been intended to 
distract from a strategic objective of establishing 
stealthy persistence within these environments.

## From Disruption to Destruction
The coming year could represent a geopolitical 
tipping point. Adversaries often attempt to take 
advantage of change, and a number of Western 
nations have recently experienced leadership 
transitions, while elections are scheduled or 
anticipated in several others.
At the same time, there’s no shortage of ongoing 
and potential regional conflicts — any one of 
which could rapidly emerge as a flashpoint 
triggering a larger-scale war.
Should such a situation arise, nation-state 
affiliated actors who’ve been refining their skills 
for economic benefit may soon be called upon to 
escalate from disruption to outright destruction. 
Taking a water treatment plant offline for a few 
Continuing a troubling trend, key sectors will be subjected to disruptive attacks and stealthy 
intrusions — as adversaries look for financial payouts and aim to prepare the digital battlefield 
for potential conflict.

hours is one thing, but disabling a plant for days 
or weeks during a hot/kinetic war will force a 
reallocation of attention and resources.
In fact, we don’t even need to speculate about 
what a modern hybrid war may look like, as 
Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine has seen 
countless attacks against energy assets, water 
systems, and other critical infrastructure.

## The Best-Case Scenario: More of the Same
Unfortunately, aside from a possible regression to 
the mean following a ‘busy’ year, there’s no reason 
to think that attacks against critical infrastructure 
will decrease.
In the best-case scenario, threat actors will 
continue to attack for financial gain, to perform 
reconnaissance, and to establish footholds that 
can be leveraged as needed in the future.
In a worst-case scenario, facilities throughout 
the Western world will endure attacks unlike 
any experienced before.

## Recommendations
- Implement a vulnerability management program that prioritizes continuous vulnerability remediation and 
assessment, with other components of the program complementing and assisting overall remediation and 
mitigation.
- Subscribe to security bulletins and incorporate their recommendations into your regular security operations.
- Ensure network and endpoint logs are available for examination and correlation — visibility into initial 
exploitation can be limited, making such telemetry especially important for identifying potential 
intrusions as quickly as possible.
- Reduce the blast radius of compromised accounts and devices through network segmentation and least-
privilege access controls.
- Ensure a comprehensive, realistic, and up-to-date disaster recovery plan is in place for your organization. 
Arctic Wolf customers may discuss this with their concierge security team for a better understanding of 
best practices for their environment. 
- Maintain proper backup practices — while backups don’t address the issues around data exfiltration, 
being able to restore operations can buy your organization time and limit the ripple effects of the attack.
- Understand and account for the shared responsibility model of cloud services — the cloud/SaaS provider 
and the SaaS customer (i.e., you) each assume ownership of particular responsibilities with respect to 
data security.
- Follow the 3-2-1 principle of backup — 3 copies of data (1 primary and 2 backup), 2 copies stored (at 
separate locations), 1 off-site storage (ideally in a secure private cloud).
- Test your recovery processes and capabilities — a real-world incident is not the time to discover that your 
backups don’t work or that they are incomplete.

# 05
The Widespread Availability of Advanced AI 
Reasoning Will Allow Threat Actors to Rapidly 
Uncover Novel Initial Access Techniques
Imagine a near-term future where capabilities 
wielded by today’s most experienced penetration 
testers are embedded within advanced AI models. 
For good or bad — or, more likely, for good and 
bad — this is where things are heading, as advanced 
reasoning capabilities are further refined and 
become a widely available core element of AI.
While frontier large language models (LLMs) 
already possess some decent programming 
capabilities — albeit with key limitations — 
they haven’t yet led to a significant increase 
in new initial access techniques emerging 
from these technologies.
However, the bleeding edge of AI is advancing 
at a breakneck pace. In just a few years we’ve 
seen extraordinary — and arguably unparalleled 
— progress in text, audio, image, and video 
generation capabilities.
In that time, one lingering question has remained: 
when will AI lead to a step-function change in 
how threat actors execute attacks?

## Lowering Barriers to Entry
So far, existing AI technology has opened up wider 
access to programming and malware authoring in 
general, and has helped to craft phishing lures and 
automate campaign workflows, but limitations 
in AI’s reasoning capabilities have prevented 
meaningful advancements in TTPs.
More specifically, logical reasoning is a key part of 
the ability to write code that functions as expected, 
especially for complex codebases — and today’s 
LLMs have known gaps in their ability to reason.
However, based on the trajectory of AI 
development, it’s safe to presume that such 
reasoning may only be one or two iterations away.

## The State of the Art
Already, recent developments in LLMs have 
brought about considerable improvements in 
this space. For example, while the capabilities 
of OpenAI’s o1-preview model are still being 
studied, preliminary results show improvements 
in benchmarks measuring capabilities in math, 
physics, chemistry, and formal logic.
Once LLMs are able to competently reason 
about the flow of data through an application, 
they are expected to facilitate discovery of novel 
vulnerabilities or to chain together vulnerabilities 
in a manner that is more difficult for humans 
to achieve.
In fact, we’ve already seen the development of an 
open-source tool that uses Anthropic’s Claude AI 
model to find zero-day vulnerabilities in Python 
codebases — even completing the entire call 
chain from user input to server output.

Thus far, even the most advanced AI models have failed to replicate human reasoning capabilities, 
but that may soon change — and once it does, threat actors will undoubtedly harness this 
newfound power to uncover new ways to break into protected environments.

## An Ongoing Arms Race
Very soon, penetration testers and hackers may 
regularly employ advanced LLMs in their efforts. Of 
course, this is a double-edged sword: while it may 
allow programmers to write more secure code and 
organizations to bolster their own defenses, it can 
just as easily be employed for malicious purposes.
The warning signs are already here: in 2024, 
OpenAI identified a cluster of ChatGPT accounts 
using the platform for scripting and vulnerability 
research tasks. OpenAI identified three threat 
actors — all with nation-state ties — performing 
these actions.
Almost certainly, this is just a glimpse into how 
state-aligned threat actors are exploring the use 
of LLMs in their vulnerability research programs.

## Trickle-Down TTPs
For its part, Microsoft has introduced a set of 
TTPs to describe LLM-based attacks. Within that 
list, “LLM-assisted vulnerability research” stands 
to become a more common practice as reasoning 
capabilities improve further.
Nevertheless, it stands to reason that nation 
state-affiliated adversaries are in the best position 
(i.e., due to their ample resources) to operate at 
the bleeding edge. Of course, new techniques 
don’t stay secret for long, and successful 
approaches will quickly trickle down to 
the wider cybercrime ecosystem.
Practically, this means that the shorter-term risks 
of novel LLM-enabled initial access techniques 
are likely concentrated among targets considered 
high-value to nation states — particularly those 
with intellectual property in key domains, or whose 
disruption would assist in a large-scale cyber 
conflict (e.g., critical infrastructure).
However, as these TTPs become more common 
and affordable, they will be incorporated into 
more attacker toolsets and will be used with 
very little discretion.

## Recommendations
- Implement network segmentation and the principle of least privilege to help limit an adversary’s ability 
to perform intrusion actions, should they successfully achieve initial access.
- As part of your vulnerability management program, conduct audits and penetration tests to identify 
areas of weakness and low visibility, and identify and prioritize remediation of significant vulnerabilities.
- Employ managed detection and response (MDR) to provide continuous monitoring capable of identifying 
common post-compromise activities.

## Conclusion
It’s interesting to note that four of our five 
predictions center on the ways in which attackers 
seek to gain access to protected environments. 
Such a result was not planned in advance, but 
is instead a reflection of what drives our team. 
By examining the evolution of attacker TTPs 
— especially those focused on initial access — 
we’re able to propose reasonable answers to 
the question, “What will adversaries try next?”
These answers, in turn, help to inform preventative 
measures that organizations can prioritize based 
upon their own operating context and risk appetite.
For what it’s worth, many of these measures are 
about getting the details right, like:
- Create a full inventory of systems
- Diligently apply patches, and prioritizing 
perimeter-facing devices 
- Check and recheck configurations
- Practice sound credential hygiene
- Monitor for stolen credentials
- Implementing a security awareness program
to minimize end user risks
These things aren’t flashy, but they’re fundamental 
— and they can make the difference between 
withstanding an attack and becoming a victim.
However, no defense is impenetrable, and plenty 
of today’s threat actors are motivated, patient, 
and well-resourced.
Consequently, just as important as preventative 
measures are the abilities to detect and respond 
— quickly and effectively — to cyber attacks that 
do occur.
Detection capabilities largely boil down to 
two things:
- Collecting as much telemetry from 
as much of your IT
