# FOREWORD
2024 was a milestone year for governance, risk, and compliance (GRC). As companies 
grappled with increasing regulatory demands, growing stakeholder expectations, and an 
ever-expanding risk landscape, the importance of GRC programs rose to prominence. This 
push resulted from several drivers, including new government regulations like the Digital 
Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and NIS2. Meanwhile, tech stack overlaps at companies 
and reliance on vendors continues to deepen, causing third-party risk to expand. 
Regulatory bodies in the US also continued to expand their oversight of cybersecurity 
practices, requiring organizations to demonstrate proactive risk management. We 
anticipate the regulatory climate in the United States will be more complex in 2025.
Increasing AI adoption also added complexity to the equation due to new emerging 
risks like cybersecurity threats, ethical concerns, and potential operational disruptions. 
Organizations found themselves needing to mature their GRC programs and provide 
the frameworks needed to manage these risks while enabling innovation. As a result, 
GRC is no longer seen as a back-office function — it is a public-facing responsibility that 
influences brand reputation and your ability to land and expand new markets.

that influences brand reputation and your 
ability to land and expand new markets.

5   //   2025 IT Risk and Compliance Benchmark Report
The findings of this survey reflect a decisive trend: 
organizations are responding to the changes seen in 
2024 and making deliberate efforts to mature their GRC 
practices, not just for compliance but as a strategic 
imperative for long-term resilience and success. From 
integrating technology solutions that centralize risk 
and compliance activities to fostering cross-functional 
collaboration and embedding a culture of accountability, 
these efforts are reshaping the GRC space. Our findings 
highlight a shift in perspective within the market: GRC 
teams are looking to mature their practices, as they are 
no longer seen as a check box exercise but a driver of 
operational excellence and strategic growth.
As you explore  the insights provided in this report, we 
invite you to consider how these trends align with your 
own organization’s journey, especially in the coming year. 
Whether you are in the early stages of building a GRC 
program or refining a well-established program, there is 
much to learn from the collective experience of your peers. 
Together, we have an opportunity to elevate the role of 
GRC in shaping a more resilient, responsible, and forward-
looking business environment.

> So, what’s the 
impact for 2025?

# Top Findings in Numbers
91%
of respondents have 
a centralized team to 
manage GRC

> This is the highest number we’ve 
ever seen in the six years we have 
conducted this survey, up from 
88% in the previous year.

60%
of respondents who manage 
risk ad-hoc or when a 
negative event happens 
experienced a data breach 
in 2024

> Respondents who use integrated 
and automated GRC tools are less 
likely to experience a data breach 
at only 41%.

72%
of surveyed companies plan 
to grow their compliance 
teams in 2025

> The majority of respondents 
are confident about their ability 
to expand their teams despite 
economic uncertainty in 2025.

63%
of respondents said their 
GRC budgets will increase in 
the next 12 to 24 months

> The majority of respondents expect 
budgets to go up for the second 
year in a row.

52%
of respondents reported that 
their teams spend between 
30% and 50% of their time 
on administrative tasks like 
manual data entry

> Although respondents are confident 
that they have taken steps to mature 
their GRC programs, they still spend 
a significant amount of time on 
manual processes.

74%
of respondents said their 
annual security budget is 
over $1 million

> Most of the surveyed organizations 
are making a substantial investment 
in security. Only 22% of respondents 
reported that their annual security 
budget is under $1 million.

59%
of respondents test all 
controls as opposed to only 
the most critical controls

> This is an increase of 26% year-
over-year, signifying a major 
industry shift to proactive 
compliance management 
strategies.

55%
of respondents said they 
use a common controls 
framework to streamline 
their GRC processes

> Using a common controls 
framework (CCF) has become a 
standard best practice, differing 
from our results in previous years.

# CHAPTER 1
# GRC Programs Are Maturing
 
A common theme in this year’s findings is the importance of centralized and cohesive approaches to GRC. Organizations 
that consolidate GRC activities under a single team report better consistency and efficiency in managing risks. In 2024, 
Hyperproof released our own GRC Maturity Model to provide a commonly accepted way for companies to assess and 
improve their own GRC capabilities. The model is segmented into four levels: 
- Traditional: reactive with insufficient or no planning 
- Initial: beginning to define processes at a departmental level 
- Advanced: establishing defined, repeatable processes at the organizational level
- Optimal: proactively using measurements to continuously improve performance
 
Each level is defined by unique characteristics to help organizations identify where their company might be on the path 
to GRC maturity. Our findings revealed that respondents are approaching GRC maturity with four key strategies aligned to 
the Hyperproof GRC Maturity Model: centralizing GRC efforts, leveraging a common controls framework (CCF), conducting 
quarterly risk assessments, and adopting comprehensive risk management programs with people, processes, and 
technology. As you explore this chapter, we encourage you to review the Hyperproof GRC Maturity Model to see where 
your organization lands and whether you have implemented the four strategies outlined below.

## STRATEGY 1: 
Centralizing enterprise-wide risk 
and compliance efforts under a 
single team
Most notably, we found that 91% of respondents reported 
having a centralized team responsible for GRC activities. 
This is up from last year, where 83% of respondents 
reported having a centralized team managing GRC 
activities. Only 8% of respondents take a siloed approach to 
risk management, where individual teams or business units 
manage risks. 
The high adoption of centralized GRC teams indicates a 
strong trend toward integration in the market, as most 
organizations recognize the importance of taking a 
unified approach to risk and compliance management. 
However, those 8% of organizations still operating in silos 
face significant challenges, including inconsistent risk 
mitigation practices and inefficiencies, which we will 
discuss later in this chapter.

Centralization does not mean a shared responsibility across all elements of GRC
 
In fact, 43% of organizations still view compliance primarily as the function responsible for enforcing regulations and 
industry standards. This is similar to last year’s results, where 45% of respondents chose this option. Another 36% see 
compliance as a tool to mitigate risks, although they acknowledge that risk management and compliance activities are 
often conducted independently in response to specific events. 
However, a new and integrated approach is emerging, with 22% of organizations choosing to align risk and compliance 
activities, a 55% increase year-over-year. One example of this kind of approach is connecting controls to risks, which 
means when addressing an issue on a control, the risk associated with that control would be reduced.

## STRATEGY 2: 
Leveraging a common  
controls framework
55% of respondents said they utilize a common controls 
framework (CCF) that aggregates and rationalizes 
regulations to boost efficiency when addressing rules 
and requirements across different frameworks. This 
represents a 10% increase year-over-year, showcasing 
that this was not a short-term trend. The remaining 
organizations were split in how they adapted to new 
regulations, with 25% choosing to align to the most 
regional laws while 6% maintain a reactive approach of 
responding to individual changes as they happen. This 
segmentation highlights the various levels of maturity 
across organizations. Mature organizations choose to 
look ahead and streamline their processes, while others 
remain siloed in their approach to GRC.

## STRATEGY 3: 
Conducting quarterly risk 
assessments
The frequency of risk assessments saw the largest 
shift year-over-year, with 59% of respondents stating 
they conducted quarterly assessments as opposed 
to annually, compared to 45% last year. One reason for 
this shift is the continued adoption of risk management 
technology, which has reduced the burden associated 
with conducting these assessments, and companies 
have realized the value of having real-time visibility of 
their risk postures.

assessments (cont.)
Many organizations also recognize the value 
of engaging with third party consultants to 
find system gaps. 73% of respondents have 
engaged with third-party consultants to 
perform regular security assessments or 
penetration tests. It’s important to note that 
frameworks like PCI DSS require penetration 
testing, and DORA will require red-teaming. 
13% of respondents adhere to PCI DSS, and 
10% adhere to DORA.

## STRATEGY 4: 
Adopting comprehensive risk 
management programs with people, 
processes, and technology
Over half (58%) of all respondents recognize that IT risk 
management requires integrated efforts across roles 
and teams. Many organizations have streamlined their 
approaches: 38% of all respondents have automated most 
of their IT risk management procedures. The number of 
organizations that continue to manage IT risk in silos 
has continued to decline year-over-year. Last year, 19% of 
organizations said they manage IT risks in silos, compared 
to 16% this year.

# CHAPTER 2
# Framework Adoption 
# Trends
This year’s survey reveals an important shift: organizations are moving from 
reactive, checklist-driven approaches toward proactive, integrated strategies 
that align risk and compliance management with their broader business goals. 
Companies are also adopting frameworks and tools that reduce inefficiencies and 
improve consistency to streamline operations. The majority of respondents (64%) 
use dedicated risk management software, and 72% of organizations use software 
that monitors their security controls and provides compliance posture reporting. 
This trend reflects a growing recognition that fragmented, manual processes 
hinder performance and scalability.

> As organizations seek to align their practices with both global and regional compliance requirements, they tend to 
prefer widely recognized standards and frameworks with controls they can repurpose for additional frameworks as they 
add them. Organizations are now taking a proactive approach to managing security and privacy because they need to 
support business expansion and pursuit of new markets, especially in the EU.

IT risk management framework 
usage
 
Among the most widely used frameworks, NIST SP 800-
37 leads with 44% adoption, signaling its usefulness in 
guiding organizations to assess, respond to, and monitor 
IT risks. Close behind is the NIST AI RMF, adopted by 42% of 
respondents, highlighting the growing focus on managing 
risks specific to AI systems.
Global standards like ISO 31000 (34%) and ISO 42001:2023 
(32%) are also popular, demonstrating their value in 
offering comprehensive approaches to risk management — 
including guidelines for AI risk — across diverse industries. 
Additionally, 31% of organizations use ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 
or ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, frameworks designed for managing 
systems and software engineering life cycles.
Other notable frameworks include the COSO Enterprise Risk 
Management framework (30%), reflecting its relevance for 
integrating IT risk into overall enterprise risk strategies, 
and the FAIR Risk Management model (27%), which is widely 
recognized for its quantitative approach to risk assessment. 
Meanwhile, 5% of organizations surveyed reported using no 
formal IT risk management framework, indicating potential 
gaps in their approach to managing IT vulnerabilities.

Preparing for AI regulations
 
Organizations aren’t just implementing more AI-
related controls because they are wary of the risks 
introduced by increased AI tools usage; regulatory 
bodies are requiring them to do so.  While a majority 
of companies are proactively addressing AI-related 
risks in line with forthcoming EU regulations, a 
significant portion remains in transition. Our findings 
underscore the importance of continued efforts to 
fully implement robust risk management systems, 
ensuring compliance and fostering trustworthy AI 
practices across markets.

The Digital Operational Resilience  
Act (DORA)
 
All financial institutions in the EU and ICT vendors of 
financial institutions must comply with DORA, a European 
Union regulation aimed at bolstering the financial 
sector’s ability to withstand and recover from digital 
disruptions and cyber threats. Adopted on November 28, 
2022, DORA entered into force on January 16, 2023, with 
enforcement beginning on January 17, 2025. 
While DORA does not explicitly address artificial 
intelligence (AI) systems, its comprehensive ICT risk 
management framework encompasses AI technologies 
utilized within financial operations. Financial institutions 
employing AI for functions like fraud detection or credit 
scoring must ensure these systems adhere to DORA’s 
standards for operational resilience. 
We asked respondents how far along their organization 
is preparing for DORA enforcement in January 2025. We 
found that over 90% of organizations have already 
started preparing for DORA.

We also asked organizations to rate their confidence in 
their ICT providers’ readiness to meet DORA’s stringent 
requirements. 49% are “very confident” in their providers’ 
preparedness, citing regular audits and ongoing 
communication as key compliance indicators. An 
additional 41% express confidence, noting observable 
progress in aligning operations with DORA standards.
However, 9% of respondents are only “somewhat 
confident,” indicating that while their providers know 
DORA, a comprehensive assessment of readiness is still 
pending. A small fraction (1%) lack confidence, expressing 
concerns about their providers’ understanding and 
capability to comply with DORA’s mandates. Notably, nearly 
all organizations recognize the applicability of DORA, with 
only 0.1% stating it does not apply to them.
These findings underscore a general sense of assurance 
among organizations regarding their ICT providers’ 
compliance with DORA. Nonetheless, uncertainty among 
some organizations highlights the need for continued 
diligence in evaluating and ensuring provider readiness as 
the enforcement date nears.

The European Union’s Artificial Intelligence 
Act (AI Act)
 
In addition to DORA, EU regulators are actively developing 
regulatory frameworks to govern AI applications and 
systems. The European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act 
(AI Act), adopted in May 2024, establishes a comprehensive 
framework to regulate AI systems to ensure their safe and 
ethical deployment across various sectors. 
We asked respondents whether their organization has 
implemented risk management frameworks to address AI 
risks and comply with the EU AI Act. The results reveal varied 
stages of readiness in implementing comprehensive risk 
management frameworks to address AI-related risks.
Notably, 59% of respondents report fully establishing 
such frameworks, aligning with the AI Act’s stringent 
requirements. An additional 34% have initiated the process 
but have yet to fully comply. Meanwhile, 4% are in the 
preliminary stages, currently assessing the Act’s mandates 
and planning future framework development. Another 4% 
consider the AI Act inapplicable to their operations, likely 
due to their AI system usage.

These findings are consistent with the results from a 
related question, where we asked respondents how 
their organization handles the overlapping compliance 
requirements between DORA, NIS2, and GDPR. For that 
question, 42% of respondents report establishing a 
common control framework that addresses common 
controls across DORA, NIS2, and GDPR, ensuring 
consistent compliance management.

# CHAPTER 3
# How Organizations Address 
# GRC Tasks
 
Respondents are transitioning from fragmented, reactive GRC task management to a more 
mature and proactive approach, enabling them to manage risks more effectively. This evolution 
underscores the importance of GRC maturity as a critical driver of operational security and 
organizational success. Our survey has shown a clear correlation between IT risk management 
approaches and the likelihood of experiencing a security breach involving sensitive data for 
three consecutive years. Organizations managing IT risk reactively or in siloed environments 
consistently report higher breach rates than those using integrated, automated tools. In 
2022, 77% of respondents who managed IT risk ad-hoc experienced a breach, compared to 57% of 
those using automated GRC solutions. 
By 2024, this trend continued, with companies managing their IT risks ad-hoc having a 25% 
higher chance of experiencing a breach than those that take an integrated approach. This 
data highlights a crucial trend: as organizations adopt more mature and integrated GRC 
practices, they significantly reduce the likelihood of experiencing a data breach. The steady 
decline in breach rates among organizations using integrated and automated tools reflects a 
broader shift toward proactive risk management and more sophisticated evidence collection, 
control monitoring, and compliance processes.

Confidence in the ability 
to identify risks is high, but 
control management remains 
more difficult
 
We found a spectrum of responses when we asked respondents to self-
assess how well their organizations performed risk management tasks. 
Notably, 97% of respondents believe they meet their objectives in 
identifying and assessing risks, indicating strong capabilities in this 
foundational area. However, performance declines in other areas: 88% 
report success in identifying controls, 84% in validating these controls 
against standard compliance frameworks, and 83% in aligning controls 
with identified risks.

The data shows that certain actions are harder to do 
well. For example: 
- feel they are not effectively monitoring and 
conducting automated control testing. 
- are not confident in their processes 
for flagging exceptions, reviewing, and 
remediating issues. 
- are not fully satisfied with their process 
for assessing controls’ effectiveness and 
capturing, tracking, and reporting deficiencies. 
- report they have room for improvement in 
assigning and tracking risk owners. 
- said they’re not meeting objectives when 
documenting risk decisions. 
While companies are proficient in initial risk identification 
and assessment, there is room for improvement when 
implementing and monitoring controls, documenting 
controls, and remediating controls.

Using integrated tools 
to manage IT risks may 
reduce the likelihood of 
a data breach
 
Organizations using integrated tools to manage IT risk 
are less likely to experience data breaches. In 2024, 
60% of organizations managing IT risk ad-hoc or when 
a negative event happens experienced a data breach, 
compared to only 35% using an integrated, mostly manual 
tool and 41% using an integrated, automated tool.
