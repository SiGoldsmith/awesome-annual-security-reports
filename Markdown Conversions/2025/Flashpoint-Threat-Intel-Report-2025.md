## Executive Summary: Cyber Threats at a Glance

**Compromised Credentials Spiked 33% to 3.2 Billion**

Flashpoint found that threat actors compromised over 3.2 billion credentials in 2024, a 33% increase from the year prior. This stolen data dominates illicit marketplaces and is used to fuel a number of illegal campaigns such as ransomware or other types of malware. Examining 2025, over 200 million credentials have already been stolen.

**Infostealers Continued Their Meteoric Rise as a Primary Threat Vector**

Of 2024’s 3.2 billion stolen credentials, 75% or 2.1 billion, were sourced from information-stealing malware, a dangerous new twist on an older threat that has infected over 23 million devices worldwide. The simplicity, effectiveness, vast availability, and low overhead costs of infostealers has propelled them to become a primary vector for ransomware and high-impact data breaches that all organizations should be proactively monitoring for in 2025.

**Vulnerabilities Grew by over 12%, More than 39% Have Known Exploits**

Flashpoint aggregated 37,302 vulnerabilities in 2024 and over 39% of them had publicly available exploit code. Leveraging exploits, threat actors can force their way into exposed systems to gain illegal access. As attack surfaces continue to grow, so too does the number of potential exposures. As a result, it’s more critical than ever for security teams to prioritize based on exploitability, instead of adopting a top-down, or severity-narrowed approach for patching.

**Ransomware Attacks Increased by 10%, Data Breaches by 6% Across All Sectors**

Once access is gained either through compromised credentials, infostealers, or breaches, financially motivated threat actors use stolen credentials and other illegally-obtained information to complete various objectives that put organizations at greater risk, such as moving laterally within systems, installing ransomware, or exfiltrating and selling data.

Flashpoint identified a 10% increase in ransomware attacks across all sectors in 2024, following a tremendous 84% increase from the previous year. In addition, the five most prolific ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups—Lockbit, Ransomhub, Akira, Play, and Qilin—were responsible for over 47% of 2024’s reported attacks. Data breaches saw a year-over-year increase of approximately 6%. All of this highlights the need for organizations to maintain strong defenses and incident response plans.

## 2025 Threat Landscape: Data Breaches

Flashpoint breach data and intelligence, as detailed in this section, comprises the Deep and Dark Web and open sources—including public attorney general reports, ransomware blogs, and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Data is current from January 1, 2024 to February 28, 2025.

Data breaches continue to pose a significant threat to organizations worldwide by fueling the cybercrime ecosystem. Flashpoint observed an approximately 6% increase in data breach activity in 2024, with our analysts recording 6,670 publicly reported data breaches. These breaches were responsible for exposing over 16.8 billion records, or “rows”—individual data points extracted from compromised systems—that included personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, social security numbers, and financial data.

This exposed PII represents an incredible risk for organizations, as threat actors use the information in various ways including leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to create large-scale phishing campaigns, or sifting through stolen data for account credentials to power brute-force attacks and account takeover attempts.

### Data Breach Overview: Data and Insights

![Image Description: Data Breaches, 2024-2025 chart showing monthly totals]

The United States represented more than 63% of the global data breach total (6,670), reporting 4,260 breaches—a 12% increase compared to 2023. However, Flashpoint notes that both totals could be higher as these figures comprise publicly reported breach events which are often under reported. In some cases, organizations may not be aware that they have been compromised until their data is listed for sale on illicit marketplaces. Additionally, others may choose not to disclose a breach event until they are legally required to. So far, Flashpoint has collected 924 data breaches in 2025, with 616 (66%) of them affecting organizations in the United States.

![Image Description: Top 3 Affected Countries in 2024: 1. United States 4,960, 2. United Kingdom 270, 3. Canada 238]

Who is most at risk? Flashpoint data shows that the following five economic sectors, as defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), reported the most data breaches:

![Image Description: Breakdown of Data Breaches by Type, 2024]

### Unauthorized Access: From Background Checks to the Kremlin

Unauthorized access is the number one cause of data breaches, with over 73% of all 2024 breach events stemming from an unwanted outsider gaining access. The highest number of records lost in this manner was 2.6 billion, when a US-based background check company failed to secure its database containing names, addresses, emails, and social security numbers, which were then listed for sale on illicit marketplaces.

This trend is not isolated to 2024. In the first few months of 2025, over 2.18 billion records have already been exposed. While the number is staggering, the more interesting development is a new and unusual breach target—Russia. Traditionally, threat actors have avoided compromising Russian organizations, let alone the Russian government. Most malware strains even have built-in code that prevents installation on Windows systems with Russian virtual keyboards installed. The ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict has significantly impacted the cyber threat landscape, creating divisions between Ukrainian and Russian threat actor groups and leading to increased targeting of Russian entities. This highlights the direct influence of geopolitical dynamics on cyber activity.

### The Effect of Data Breaches on the Cyber Threat Landscape

Beyond the immediate reputational, financial, and legal repercussions for organizations, data breaches also contribute to the long-term growth and sophistication of the cyber threat landscape. Most threat actors are financially motivated, selling billions of stolen data records on illicit marketplaces and forums, which further fuels the cycle of cybercrime.

Leveraging this stolen data, threat actors harvest actionable information, often in the form of credentials—particularly account details such as usernames and passwords. This, in combination with other sensitive data and PII, provides attackers with what they need to operationalize their illegal campaigns. Overall, Flashpoint found that threat actors compromised over 3.2 billion credentials in 2024, a 33% increase from the year prior. Examining 2025, over 200 million credentials have already been stolen highlighting the pervasiveness of this threat.

![Image Description: 2024-2025 Data Breaches Responsible for Exposing the Most Records]

### Key Takeaways

1.  **Data breach activity is escalating, with a significant impact on sensitive data:** The 6% increase in data breaches in 2024, resulting in 16.8 billion exposed records, demonstrates a steadily growing trend. This massive exposure of sensitive information such as social security numbers, financial data, and account information poses a substantial risk to both individuals and organizations.
2.  **Unauthorized access remains the primary driver of data breaches:** Exacerbated by geopolitical tensions, 73% of breaches stem from unauthorized access, which underscores the critical importance of robust access controls. The convergence of cyber and geopolitical factors has also resulted in a shift in targeting against Russian entities in 2025.
3.  **Data breaches fuel the broader cybercrime ecosystem:** The sale of stolen data on illicit marketplaces and the subsequent use of compromised credentials to launch further attacks create a self-perpetuating cycle of cybercrime. Organizations must recognize that data breaches are not isolated incidents but contribute to a larger, interconnected web of cyber threats.

### Threat Posture Assessment

-   Is my organization operating in a highly-targeted economic sector? If so, can I vouch for where all of our critical data is being stored and secured?
-   Are offline backups being tested regularly for integrity, and is it clear who their owners are?
-   Are my security teams proactively tracking known illicit forums and marketplaces for any mentions of my organization and third-party partners?

## 2025 Threat Landscape: Information-Stealing Malware

Flashpoint infostealer data and intelligence, as detailed in this section, is derived from extensive monitoring of illicit online marketplaces, dedicated Telegram channels, and specialized bot shops where stealer logs and related services are traded. Data is current from January 1, 2024 to February 28, 2025.

Information-stealing malware had a profound effect on the threat landscape, stealing 2.1 billion, or 75%, of 2024’s 3.2 billion stolen credentials. Also known as infostealers or stealers, their simplicity, vast availability, and low costs have made them incredibly popular among threat actors, with these malicious programs playing a pivotal role in many of 2024’s most headline-grabbing data breaches.

Flashpoint analysts infiltrated threat actor communities and discussion groups, tracking over 164 infostealer-related sales threads last year, finding a total of 24 unique stealer strains listed for sale on illicit marketplaces. Each of these strains were specifically designed to circumvent specific security measures, employing a wide and diverse range of techniques—such as utilizing Telegram for exfiltration and command or control (C2) or preventing installation on virtual machines to avoid unnecessary detection and forensics.

### Infostealer Overview: Data and Insights

![Image Description: Top 5 Most Prolific Infostealers in 2024 By Infected Hosts or Devices]
![Image Description: Windows OS Breakdown of Infected Host Data, 2024]

### Infostealer Distribution: Corporate vs. Small Business

Infostealers compromised 23 million hosts and devices last year. Of those on Microsoft operating systems, data suggests 69% of infostealer infections likely targeted devices on corporate systems. Conversely, 21.3% affected small businesses and personal devices. Regardless of size, organizations need to ensure that security teams are actively monitoring infostealer activity, in addition to being knowledgeable about prolific stealer strains such as RisePro, StealC, and Lumma.

Despite recent takedowns it is still likely for Redline and Meta to be repurposed, or duplicated as “new” strains. Being knowledgeable of infostealer tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) is essential since every unique stealer has its own method of bypassing commonly used security measures, and can be used in combination with each other for maximum chances of success.

![Image Description: Top 5 Countries Affected by Information-Stealing Malware, 2024]
![Image Description: Infostealer Prices, 2024]

### The Effect of Information-Stealing Malware’s on the Cyber Threat Landscape

In April 2024, a data storage company suffered a breach that impacted over 165 organizations. Threat actors used stolen credentials obtained through various infostealers including Vidar, Risepro, Redline, Racoon, Lumma, and Meta Stealer to gain unauthorized access in order to compromise sensitive data belonging to multiple high-profile organizations.

Infostealers are inexpensive, costing threat actors $200 USD a month on average. They are also easy to use and are readily available on underground forums and dark web marketplaces. Stealers have been incredibly effective in carrying out crippling supply chain attacks and targeting critical infrastructure. As such, organizations working with third-parties should be extra vigilant in securing any shared sensitive data.

While there have been attempts to hinder infostealers by implementing new app-bound cookie encryption updates, as well as other security improvements, stealer developers have been quick to respond. Furthermore, despite the takedown of Redline—the most prolific stealer of 2024—and Meta Stealer, the overall market and use of infostealers in 2025 continue to rise.

### Key Takeaways

1.  **Information-stealing malware is a dominant, growing, and highly accessible threat:** Infostealers are becoming a pivotal component in the modern cyberattack chain, acting as a gateway to broader compromises. Their success in 2024 stealing 2.1 billion credentials and infecting 23 million devices, coupled with their low cost and widespread availability, have elevated them to a primary threat vector that all organizations should be proactively monitoring in 2025.
2.  **Corporate systems are particularly at risk:** Flashpoint data suggests that 69% of infostealer infections impacted corporate hosts and devices, compared to 21.3% affecting small businesses. This highlights a critical exposure in enterprise security and demonstrates the need for security teams to be knowledgeable of existing, and emerging stealer strains—especially in regards to how they are designed to bypass security measures.
3.  **The infostealer market is dynamic and resilient:** The rapid emergence of new infostealer strains and the persistence of the market, even after the takedowns of Redline and Meta Stealer, indicates a highly adaptable and resilient threat landscape. Organizations must adopt a proactive security posture, continuously monitoring for new threats and adapting their defenses accordingly.

### Threat Posture Evaluation

- Is my organization actively monitoring online channels and communities where our stolen credentials are often shared?
- Do my security teams and third-party partners have plans in place to respond to infostealer infections and mitigate their impact?
- Is my Cyber Threat Intelligence team knowledgeable of the most prolific stealer strains and how they bypass security measures?

## 2025 Threat Landscape: Vulnerabilities

The data in this section reflects Flashpoint’s vulnerability intelligence, covering all attack surfaces—including vendors, endpoints, cloud, Internet of things (IoT), operational technology, open source software (OSS), and third-party libraries and dependencies. Flashpoint’s vulnerability enrichment provides full context into metadata such as EPSS, the MITRE ATT&CK framework, exploit intelligence, social risk, and ransomware likelihood. Data is current from January 1, 2024 to February 28, 2025.

Attack surfaces continue to grow each year as new software and hardware flaws, or vulnerabilities, are discovered in organizational technologies. According to Flashpoint’s vulnerability intelligence data, there has been a year-over-year increase of over 12%, with our analysts aggregating 37,302 vulnerabilities in 2024. Looking specifically at the first two months of 2025, Flashpoint has already collected and detailed 5,784 vulnerabilities with disclosures showing no signs of slowing down.

As vulnerability disclosures continue to steadily grow, organizations need to adapt their security strategies appropriately. Due to the sheer amount of resources and research required, it is unrealistic for the majority of organizations to triage, remediate, or mitigate every vulnerability. Instead, security leaders and vulnerability management teams need to implement a risk-based patching framework that is geared towards their unique needs and is based on relentless prioritization.

### Vulnerability Overview: Data and Insights

![Image Description: Vulnerability Disclosures and Exploits, 2024-2025 chart]
![Image Description: Top 10 Days with Most Vulnerability Disclosures, 2024-2025 chart]

Examining disclosures on a daily level, hundreds of vulnerabilities are steadily being released throughout the year. Looking at the ten days with the most vulnerability disclosures, there is a consistent trend: they all are dominated by Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday, when Microsoft releases updates and patches for its software products on the second Tuesday of each month.

Since Patch Tuesday’s introduction in 2003, Flashpoint has observed an overwhelming number of notable vendors adopting it for their own releases. This, coupled with the growth of Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) Numbering Authorities (CNA)—organizations authorized to assign CVE IDs to vulnerabilities and publish CVE records—has caused disclosures to be grouped more tightly together, playing a major role in every year’s rising totals.

### Limitations of CVSS Severity Scores
Organizations have historically patched “top-down,” focusing on vulnerabilities highly rated in severity. However, this approach has not brought meaningful results as too many vulnerabilities are rated high (7.0) to critical (10.0) using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). This is mainly due to CVSS specifications mandating to “score for the worst” if there are no details. 2024 was no exception as over 30% of all vulnerabilities fell between those ranges. As a result, prioritizing solely based on this characteristic will not result in effective or timely patching.

Security teams must remember that different versions of CVSS can drastically impact the score of a given vulnerability, especially for issues that borderline between “medium” and “high.” An immediate shift in scoring guidelines could either drastically increase or decrease critical workloads. Regardless, Flashpoint includes up-to-date and corrected scores for CVSSv2, v3, and v4 for every newly disclosed vulnerability.

![Image Description: CVSS Breakdown for 2024 Vulnerabilities]

### Cut Critical Vulnerability Workloads by 83% Using Metadata

The most effective way to prioritize vulnerabilities is by filtering critical vulnerabilities leveraging metadata—particularly using exploit intelligence. Examining 2024, over 39% of all vulnerabilities had publicly available exploit code, a 26% increase from the previous year. These issues represent an immediate risk to organizations. However, remediating or mitigating every exploitable vulnerability in a timely manner is still an incredibly resource-taxing undertaking, and unrealistic for most organizations.

To make this timely, organizations can cut their critical vulnerability workloads by 83% using additional metadata. Security teams should further filter exploitable vulnerabilities by:

1.  Determining if any exploits are remotely exploitable: Remote code executions (RCEs) allows threat actors to compromise affected systems regardless of where the attacker is located.
2.  Whether there is a documented solution for the exploit: An existing solution saves time spent on vulnerability research, allowing organizations to immediately triage and patch issues.

Depending on any other organizational requirements, other considerations and metadata, such as Ransomware Likelihood scoring, social risk, or MITRE ATT&CK mapping can be added. Once applied, security teams can produce an actionable vulnerability report, and then secure the proper resources to remediate them. Then, once those issues are fully resolved, they can then focus on other flagged issues.

![Image Description: Breakdown of Actionable, High Severity Vulnerabilities, by Availability and Exploitation, Disclosed in 2024]

### The Effect of Vulnerabilities on the Cyber Threat Landscape

Vulnerability exploits often serve as the initial access point in cyberattacks such as ransomware. Attackers actively scan for and target systems with known vulnerabilities, a process made easier by infostealers (see page 11). Once a vulnerability is identified, threat actors leverage publicly available exploits, develop their own, or solicit for exploit code to gain a foothold in the target network.

![Image Description: Vulnerability Exploit Attack Chain]

### Key Takeaways

1.  **Vulnerabilities are surging, creating an overwhelming challenge for vulnerability management (VM) teams:** The 12% year-over-year increase in vulnerability disclosures, with over 37,000 vulnerabilities in 2024, demonstrates the sheer volume of security flaws that organizations must contend with. This deluge, exacerbated by Patch Tuesday and the growing numbers of CNAs, makes it nearly impossible for VM teams to address every vulnerability, necessitating a strategic, risk-based approach to patching.
2.  **Relying solely on CVSS scores for prioritization is ineffective; exploit intelligence and metadata are crucial:** The overabundance of high to critical CVSS scores renders them insufficient for effective vulnerability prioritization. Leveraging exploit intelligence and additional metadata, such as remote exploitability and known solutions, enables organizations to reduce their critical vulnerability workload by 83%. This focused approach allows security teams to concentrate on the most impactful threats, while maximizing their resources.
3.  **Vulnerabilities are a prime attack vector for threat actors, emphasizing the need for proactive defense:** Vulnerability exploits allow threat actors to gain initial access to target networks for attacks like infostealers or ransomware. The increasing availability of exploit code and the ease of scanning for vulnerable systems underscore the need for proactive vulnerability management. Organizations must prioritize timely patching of exploitable vulnerabilities to minimize their attack surface.

### Threat Posture Evaluation

- Is my vulnerability management team prioritizing remediation based on risk and threat intelligence?
- Does my vulnerability management team have access to comprehensive metadata, such as Ransomware Likelihood and MITRE ATT&CK mapping?
- Is my IT team able to quickly patch vulnerable systems, or are they forced to research solutions themselves?

![Image Description: Vulnerability Quickview - January 2024 - December 2024]

## 2025 Threat Landscape: Ransomware
The data in this section comprises victimized organizations that have been announced on ransomware blogs and leak sites. Data is current from January 1, 2024 to February 28, 2025.

Ransomware attacks, in which malicious actors encrypt an organization’s data and demand a ransom for its release, continue to plague organizations. Flashpoint identified 5,742 ransomware attacks—approximately a 10% year-over-year increase—across all sectors, with technology (24.6%), manufacturing (18.3%), and retail (12.2%) experiencing the most ransomware attacks. This 10% increase follows a tremendous 84% year-over-year increase the previous year, showing that ransomware still remains an alarmingly high and dangerous threat.

While ransomware attacks occur globally, the vast majority of them affect the United States, due to the value of the data its organizations maintain and their demonstrated high willingness to pay. Flashpoint analysts found that the United States experienced over 51% of 2024’s total ransomware attacks. 1,462 ransomware attacks have been reported in 2025, with 805 (55%) of them affecting US-based organizations.

### Ransomware Overview: Data and Insights

![Image Description: Reported Ransomware Attacks, 2024-2025 chart]
![Image Description: Breakdown of Ransomware Attacks by Industry, 2024]

### Ransomware-as-a-Service: Fueling the Growth of the Ransomware Ecosystem
The staggering availability of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) plays a massive role in ransomware’s continued growth. RaaS, combined with other malware, such as infostealers, creates a force-multiplier effect that greatly lowers the barrier to entry, allowing unsophisticated attackers to leverage these complex tools as long as they can afford an illicit monthly subscription, on average costing $200 USD.

RaaS has a direct effect on the ransomware landscape, with just five of 2024’s most prolific RaaS groups—Lockbit, Ransomhub, Akira, Play, and Qilin—being responsible for over 47% of the year’s ransomware attacks.

Flashpoint recorded several hierarchy changes within the landscape as high-profile ransomware groups discontinued operations and newly emerged groups filled the void. One of the most notable changes to the top 10 RaaS list in 2024 was the absence of ALPHV/BlackCat, the second most active RaaS group last year. Their absence on the list can be attributed to the December 2023 seizure of their leak site by global law enforcement agencies. Taking their place on the list is RansomHub, a group that first appeared in February 2024. The group quickly gained notoriety due to their high-profile attack on a major healthcare organization. It is highly likely that RansomHub is composed of former members of ALPHV/BlackCat.

![Image Description: Top 10 Most Prolific Ransomware-as-a-Service Groups in 2024]
![Image Description: Top 10 Countries Affected by Ransomware, 2024]

### The Effect of Ransomware on the Cyber Landscape
The commoditization of RaaS has created a challenging environment for security teams, with over 42% of all reported data breaches explicitly citing ransomware. Developments in the cyber threat landscape continue to show that ransomware attacks are not isolated incidents.

Lockbit continued their place as the most prolific RaaS group, listing 780 victims on their leak site in 2024, despite facing several upheavals. In February 2024, the group lost thirty-four servers, 14,000 rogue accounts, and 200 cryptocurrency accounts due to Operation Cronos, a collaborative global law enforcement takedown. Then in May 2024, the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency identified and coordinated sanctions against Lockbit’s founder, Russian national Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev. However, Lockbit continues to operate, albeit posting lower numbers of victims compared to previous years.

Ransomware is often part of a complex, multi-stage operation that can weave together infostealers, AI-powered phishing lures or other AI-assisted attacks, vulnerability exploits, in addition to other various tactics, tools, and procedures. Therefore, organizations need comprehensive intelligence that also monitors ransomware-adjacent threats. This can equip teams to identify potential attacks, prevent them, and respond swiftly during incidents, ensuring quick recovery with minimal disruption.

![Image Description: Common Ransomware Attack Chain]

### Key Takeaways

1.  **Ransomware remains a significant, pervasive, and evolving threat:** There was a 10% increase in ransomware attacks in 2024, totaling 5,742 incidents. This follows a 84% YoY increase experienced in the previous year. The continued prevalence of ransomware, particularly in the technology, manufacturing, and retail sectors, highlights the need for organizations to maintain strong defenses and incident response plans.
2.  **RaaS is lowering the barrier of entry, enabling a wider range of attackers:** The accessibility of RaaS offerings, combined with other malware like infostealers, is lowering the barrier to entry for cybercriminals. This ‘force-multiplier effect’ allows less sophisticated attackers to launch complex ransomware attacks, increasing the overall risk for organizations of all sizes.
3.  **Ransomware attacks are often part of a larger, multi-faceted operation:** Ransomware is rarely an isolated incident. It is often integrated into complex attack chains involving various tactics, techniques, and procedures, such as AI-powered phishing, vulnerability exploitation, and data exfiltration. This underscores the need for a holistic security approach that addresses the interconnectedness of cyber threats.

#### Threat Posture Evaluation
- Do my security teams have a process for proactively monitoring RaaS leak sites and illicit marketplaces to detect potential mentions of the organization?
- Is my security team aware of the latest TTPs being employed by the most prolific RaaS groups such as Lockbit, Ransomhub, Akira, Play, and Qilin?
- Do we have a ransomware response team or playbook that includes negotiation protocols, is easily accessible, up to date, and based upon actual resources?

## Commentary

We live in interesting times, where technology is both a blessing and a curse. 2025 is following a year of significant upheaval in the cybercrime landscape, marked by high-profile arrests, platform policy changes, and the rise and fall of prominent threat actors. The aforementioned risks—compromised credentials, infostealers, and vulnerabilities—served as an undercurrent for the many cyberattacks and extortion events that took place throughout the year.

In cybersecurity, curses typically come in threes:

1.  May You Live in Interesting Times: The volatility and change that comes with progress
2.  May You Come to the Attention of Those in Authority: Success, notoriety, and its eventual consequences
