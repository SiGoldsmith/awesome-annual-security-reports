# Opening Letter From Our CEO
I am excited to present the 2025 Global Automotive and Smart Mobility Cybersecurity Report. This report comes at a critical time, as cyber threats are evolving faster than the industry is prepared to handle, outpacing regulation-driven measures.
While UNECE WP.29 R155 compliance, particularly with its 2024 milestone, has brought attention to regulatory adherence, it has also created a false sense of security. Cybersecurity regulations, such as R155, set the minimum required standards but are insufficient to address the dynamic and complex threats confronting our ecosystem.
Through our work with leading OEMs and mobility stakeholders, we’ve seen escalating cyber risks with serious implications on safety, brand reputation, operational continuity, data privacy, and financial stability. In 2024, ransomware attacks on the Automotive and Mobility ecosystem surged, causing unprecedented disruptions. The rise of software-defined and autonomous vehicles has introduced new vulnerabilities, while the integration of smart mobility devices like EV chargers and fleet systems into critical infrastructure has expanded the attack surface and magnified the stakes.
China’s strategic investments and government support have propelled its Automotive industry to a position of global leadership, particularly in the electric vehicle (EV) sector. However, this rapid growth has also spotlighted critical concerns around cybersecurity, data privacy risks, and potential espionage, underscoring the need for urgent action.
Addressing these challenges requires collective action. OEMs, Tier-1, Tier-2 suppliers, and smart mobility providers must go beyond mere compliance. Stakeholders should adopt proactive, data-driven strategies and consistently invest in vSOCs, mobility-centric API security, threat intelligence, and vulnerability management to bridge cyber gaps and enhance resilience. Cybersecurity is no longer just a technical challenge—it is a strategic imperative requiring leadership commitment. By working together, we can strengthen the automotive and smart mobility ecosystem, safeguarding customer trust and ensuring industry success.
At Upstream, we have been at the forefront of securing the connected vehicle ecosystem and mobility assets since 2017, when we first introduced the Upstream Platform. The Upstream Platform has proven instrumental in helping organizations move beyond compliance to proactively monitor and protect millions of vehicles and mobility assets. With advanced AI and ML capabilities and deep industry expertise, Upstream is well-positioned to tackle the challenges ahead. As we navigate 2025 and beyond, we remain committed to leading the charge in securing the future of connected mobility.

Sincerely,
Yoav Levy
Co-Founder & CEO

# Methodology
The Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem benefits from Upstream's continuously updated database of cybersecurity incidents, offering a critical resource for staying ahead of cyber threats.
In 2024 alone, Upstream researchers analyzed 409 new incidents, contributing to a total of 1,877 documented cases, some dating back to 2010. By monitoring hundreds of deep and dark web forums, we compiled this comprehensive and actionable report to help you navigate the evolving cybersecurity landscape with confidence. Through our global analysis of automotive cyber incidents, Upstream empowers the entire Smart Mobility ecosystem to understand, mitigate, and defend against both existing and emerging threats.
Upstream’s AutoThreat® cyber threat intelligence platform leverages advanced technology, AI, and automations to continuously scan all layers of the web for new cyber incidents related to the Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem. The collected data is indexed and analyzed on the AutoThreat® platform, providing a centralized and actionable repository of insights. Our dedicated team of researchers and analysts meticulously categorizes and examines this data to uncover the motivations and activities of threat actors, as well as the impact of cyber threats on mobility assets.
Each incident is enriched with contextual information—such as the attack's geolocation, impact, attack vector, company type, and the required proximity of the attacker to the target. This creates an in-depth and practical repository to help organizations strengthen their security postures.
The incidents analyzed in this report were sourced from diverse channels, including media outlets, academic research, bug bounty programs, verified social media accounts of government law enforcement agencies, the Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures (CVE) database, and other publicly available online sources. Beyond these, Upstream’s analysts actively monitor the deep and dark web to track threat actors operating behind the scenes of automotive cyberattacks.
In 2024, our research scope expanded significantly to address the rising risks, the growing number of targeted mobility assets, and the evolution of attack technologies. This expanded effort included tracking 1,133 of the most active threat actors, whose activities are analyzed in a dedicated chapter titled “Cyber threats from the deep and dark web.” Notably, these incidents are excluded from the statistics and charts presented in other chapters of the report. Please note that when analyzing attack vectors and their impacts, an incident may involve multiple attack vectors and potential impact elements. As a result, the total percentages may exceed 100% across all incidents.
Despite our comprehensive approach, there may be additional incidents and attacks that remain unreported or undiscovered, and therefore not included in this report.
For further insights, a more detailed analysis is exclusively available to AutoThreat® PRO customers.

# Executive Summary
The Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem experienced a sharp increase in cyber threats throughout 2024, with large-scale ransomware attacks causing unprecedented disruption. As cyber risks outpace regulation-driven measures, the growing gap between the risk landscape and organizational resilience has become increasingly evident.
To address this widening gap, organizations must prioritize resilience by investing beyond regulatory compliance. Upstream's 2025 Global Automotive Cybersecurity Report explores this cybersecurity gap, China’s expanded EV market share, and the key trends, vulnerabilities, and incidents that shaped the ecosystem in 2024.

# Chapter 1: The Rise of the Automotive Cybersecurity Gap
As the next wave of innovations amplifies risks and impact, while regulatory and cybersecurity fatigue sets in, how can OEMs strengthen their cybersecurity postures and effectively minimize cybersecurity gaps?

## Automotive Innovation Expands the Attack Surface, and Fatigue Sets In, OEM Cybersecurity Postures Are Eroding
For the last few years, innovative software-defined and autonomous technologies, coupled with the adoption of advanced IoT technologies in the Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem, have resulted in growing regulatory pressures. Automotive stakeholders are challenged with preparing for new regulations, standards, guidelines, and the need to develop new best practices. According to research by BlackBerry QNX, the demand for rapid innovation weighs heavily on automotive software teams, as 75% of software developers admit deadline urgency often compromises functional safety.[^1]
Ultimately, software development and cybersecurity teams are pressured to innovate quickly and comply with ever expanding regulations, which introduces a continuous conflict.
In 2024, many OEMs and their suppliers continued their heightened focus on implementing UNECE WP.29 R155 for Cyber Security Management System (CSMS) and Type Approval[^2] —which became mandatory for all new vehicles in production starting July 2024—as well as R156 for Software Update Management System (SUMS)[^3], and ISO/SAE 21434[^4], as part of the global effort to create a unified approach to protecting connected assets against cyber threats.
Historically, periods of heightened focus on compliance activities to meet a regulatory deadline often result in some type of end-user desensitization or fatigue—which often undermines the effectiveness and intended outcome of the regulation. In the case of cybersecurity fatigue, security postures decline once regulatory compliance is achieved, leaving organizations vulnerable to cybersecurity threats.
This type of behavior has been observed following the adoption of other laws such as GDPR[^5] and CCPA[^6] in consumer privacy, HIPAA[^7] in healthcare, PCI DSS[^8] in payments, and NERC CIP[^9] in utilities.
Take GDPR for example. In the six years since it came into force, it has raised awareness of personal data protection rights and made data privacy and compliance board-level issues—but it has also led to consent fatigue, weakening the effectiveness of the consent mechanism, and undermining privacy protection and trust in data processing. Additionally, the prioritization of non-compliance and fine enforcement over outcome is not indicative of effective regulation.
In January 2024, Upstream's Global Automotive Cybersecurity Report declared 2023 as the automotive cybersecurity inflection point, and examined how cybersecurity risks have evolved from experimental hacking into large-scale automotive attacks.
Upstream data revealed that the proportion of incidents with a “High” (thousands of mobility assets) or “Massive” (millions of mobility assets) impact continued to increase between 2023 and 2024, accounting for nearly 60% of all incidents.[^10]
The same is true for the Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem, where today, a sense of compliance has led to the illusion that current cybersecurity postures are enough—despite cyber incidents increasing in risk and impact, with severe safety and trust, operational availability, data privacy, and financial implications.

The rise in large-scale incidents can be attributed to several factors that point to an emerging cybersecurity gap:
- API connectivity between vehicles and multiple devices and apps (e.g., OEM companion app, charging app, dealerships, smart mobility, etc.) lowers the cyber attack threshold and represents a prime attack vector for large-scale remote attacks.
- The introduction and rapid innovation related to Software-defined Vehicle (SDV) and Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technologies that enable remote access to core vehicle functionality and result in massive-scale attacks.
- With constantly expanding attack surfaces, lower attack thresholds, and a variety of attack methods, attackers can launch a wide range of attacks.
- AI-based automation of attack processes and preliminary research offers threat actors the ability to design attacks at scale quickly and with less resources.
- Ransomware as a service (RaaS) and data exfiltration attacks are relatively easy to execute, and provide immediate financial and reputational benefits to attackers.
- Overburdened IT and product cybersecurity teams focused on regulatory compliance, coupled with increasingly complex IT, OT and product environments, provide ample opportunities for attackers to exploit.

### The Automotive Cybersecurity Gap
As the threat landscape evolves and the cybersecurity gap widens, the regulatory landscape is expected to adapt effectively; organizations must continuously invest in expanding their resilience beyond regulatory requirements.

## The Year of Ransomware: Large-Scale Ransomware Attacks With Unprecedented Impact Dominated 2024
As the Automotive industry rapidly integrates advanced technologies such as software-oriented architectures, autonomous driving, electric vehicles, and aftermarket IoT devices —the impact of the misalignment between current regulatory-driven cybersecurity postures and real-world threats becomes increasingly evident.
Ransomware attacks have serious financial implications, including lost revenue from service and business disruption, ransom payments, high recovery costs, legal and regulatory compliance issues, and fines due to data and privacy breaches, as well as brand and reputation damage. But when it comes to product cybersecurity, especially in the Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem, ransom attacks have direct implications on safety, uptime, and operational availability and efficiency—as well as significant risks to sensitive data.
The adoption of Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), a ransomware distribution model similar to cloud computing models (e.g., Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service) where ransomware providers maintain infrastructure and services and charge customers for access, has been a major factor in ransomware's continued growth and success.
The escalating geopolitical tensions have increasingly brought nation-state threat actors into the ransomware spotlight. In April 2024, the US Department of the Treasury sanctioned two companies and four individuals involved in malicious cyber activity on behalf of Iran, targeting more than a dozen US companies and government entities through cyber operations, including ransomware, spear phishing and malware attacks.[^12] The four individuals were also indicted by the US Department of Justice for their role.[^13] In July, a North Korean national was indicted for his involvement in a conspiracy to hack and extort US hospitals and other health care providers.[^14]
One of the biggest threats to enterprise and product cybersecurity is ransomware, perhaps the most defining cybercrime of the past decade, and it continues to grow every year.
In August, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) warning that a group of Iran-based threat actors continues to exploit US and foreign organizations.[^15]
In 2024, attackers found new ways to hack into systems (e.g., new techniques that enable new zero-day exploits, edge device exploits, GenAI-based automations, etc.); focused their efforts on big-game hunting (e.g., large, high-value organizations or high-profile entities); increased targeting of operational technology (OT) and connected devices; and had greater concentration on data exfiltration—increasingly used in the Automotive and Smart Mobility ecosystem and driving the growth of ransomware economy in 2024, especially with the introduction of laws such as the US SEC’s cybersecurity incident disclosure rules,[^16] and the EU’s NIS 2 cybersecurity directive.[^17]
Stricter cybersecurity reporting requirements and large regulatory fines change ransomware dynamics. Attackers can inflict financial and reputational damage without encrypting data and shutting down operations, and victims can no longer ignore attacks and avoid reporting incidents.
Traditional ransomware extortion tactics, where attackers encrypt critical data, shutdown the victim's operation, and extort them with the threat of releasing sensitive data (e.g., double extortion) have proven less effective for attackers—data encryption is resource-intensive and many organizations can restore their data from backups.
In September 2023, a leading US-based trucking and fleet management solutions provider experienced a prolonged double extortion attack that resulted in customers being unable to electronically log their on-road hours—as required by federal regulations—or track their transported inventory.[^18]
In response, the company hired external cybersecurity experts to investigate and applied for a waiver from the US Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to allow truckers to use paper logs until service was restored.[^19] In November 2024, the same company was reported to have experienced a massive data breach when a threat actor advertised on a dark web forum that he accessed and exfiltrated over 70TB of sensitive data from the company’s systems. The threat actor shared evidence and samples of the stolen data to prove his claims. A copy of the data was offered for sale for $30,000, with a negotiable price of $100,000 to remove the data.[^20]
By shifting focus from data encryption to data exfiltration and creating data-leak marketplaces—where stolen data is sold to the highest bidder—attackers reduce attack overhead and improve their overall efficiency and return on investment.
According to research by Check Point, global ransomware attacks increased by 30% in Q2 2024—the highest increase in two years. In terms of industry impact, the manufacturing sector was the most affected, representing 29% of publicly known ransomware attack victims globally, with a significant 56% year-over-year increase. The transportation sector experienced a 40% increase. The communications and utilities industries, both of which rely heavily on IoT and are closely tied to the mobility ecosystem, have experienced dramatic increases in ransomware incidents, 177% and 186%, respectively.[^21]
AEG’s figure includes lost earnings from the approximately 56,000 new unit sales that AEG estimated were lost during the three-week period; lost earnings on used car sales; lost earnings on parts and service; additional staffing and IT service costs; and additional floor plan interest costs on inventory. Damages to consumers, reputational damages to dealers, litigation costs, and other categories of damages are excluded.
The Anderson Economic Group (AEG) estimated that total direct losses to franchised auto dealers reached $1.02 billion.[^23]
In 2024, AutoThreat® researchers detected 108 mobility-specific ransomware attacks and 214 data breaches, which contributed heavily to the rise in cybersecurity incidents in the mobility ecosystem.
Most notably, in mid-June, a ransomware attack on a leading US-based provider of dealership management software used by 15,000 dealerships, resulted in shutting down dealer operations for nearly 3 weeks. According to a report from CNN citing multiple sources, the company likely paid the $25M ransom to expedite recovery and end the outage.[^22]
IN 2024, AUTOTHREAT® RESEARCHERS DETECTED 108 MOBILITY-SPECIFIC RANSOMWARE ATTACKS AND 214 DATA BREACHES
Cybersecurity risk is likely to be dramatically altered by the proliferation of SDV and AV technologies
The convergence of technologies known collectively as ACES—Autonomous Driving, Connectivity, Electrification, and Shared Mobility—has forced stakeholders to move from the traditional hardware-defined architecture to a software-oriented architecture, presenting growing cybersecurity challenges.
APIs have been playing a key role in increasing connectivity between in-vehicle components, backend systems and applications. As more functionality has been exposed through APIs, cybersecurity risks have also increased dramatically, while attack costs and thresholds have decreased.
Here are a few more examples from 2024:
- In February, Japanese OEM US division allegedly hit by a ransomware attack resulting in data theft of 22GB of sensitive vehicle and customer information[^24]
- In February, South Korean OEM hit by large-scale ransomware attack disrupting operations[^25]
- In March, Chinese Tier-2 supplier was hit by a ransomware attack leading to a major breach of 1.2TB of data, impacting Chinese and global OEMs[^26]
- In April, Italian branch of a German OEM experienced a data breach compromising customer PII[^27]
- In July, Indian OEM hit by a ransomware attack resulting in company data theft[^28]
- In August, South Korean automotive supplier was hit by a ransomware attack, resulting in 2.3TB of company data compromised[^29]
- In September, Chinese Tier-1 specializing in automotive CAN BUS protocol solutions was hit by a cyberattack disrupting its website operations[^30]
The ability to control software components and exploit vulnerabilities poses a significant threat to the cybersecurity posture of fleet-wide control systems, opening the door for exponential growth in the scale and impact of attacks.
Frequent OTA updates mean the SBOM is no longer static—but rather constantly evolving long after a vehicle leaves the factory. Risk profiles continuously change, constantly requiring risk and vulnerability analysis—but they can be remediated in real time as well.
Furthermore, modern SDV attack surfaces go beyond in-vehicle components to include charging points and networks, as well as 3rd-party applications for smart mobility, OEM services, telematics devices, and electric vehicle (EV) charging—adding even more complexity.
Finally, the vast amount of data generated by SDVs and AVs and stored in backend systems, presents an additional risk. Backend systems (e.g., telematics servers and applications) play a crucial role in delivering advanced connected vehicle functions and services, as well as collecting and managing huge amounts of sensitive data related to vehicle state, location, usage patterns, and driver behavior.
Attackers can tap into this data, which contains the PII of millions of automotive users, without even needing to hack the actual vehicles. The threat of cyberattacks on backend servers is particularly high because of the ability of malicious threat actors to impact entire fleets, both in terms of control and data access.
The growing reliance on software-oriented architectures, APIs, and backend systems highlights the urgent need for OEMs to safeguard the software services, components and the sensitive data stored in their backend systems.
As SDVs and AVs become more prevalent, the cyber posture balance is likely to change dramatically, further widening the cybersecurity gap.
SDV and AV technologies are vulnerable to a wide range of cyber attacks
Software-defined and autonomous vehicles provide remote access to core vehicle functionality, allowing hackers to effectively attack at scale.
In 2024, security researchers discovered and exploited numerous vulnerabilities in software and hardware components used in SDVs and AVs—such as LiDAR sensors, radars, cameras, high-accuracy positioning hardware, OEM applications, and software development platforms—often directly affecting the safety and operational reliability of vehicles.
In February 2024, security researchers from Duke University could trigger hallucinations in AV sensor systems without prior knowledge of the radar system in use. In one demonstration of the attack, called MadRadar, researchers caused a hallucination in a Doppler radar system, causing it to mistakenly believe that a vehicle traveling away from the sensor turned around and was on its way to a head-on collision. According to the researchers, MadRadar detects and learns radar types "in microseconds" and adapts its attack instantly. This type of attack can be used to fool adaptive cruise control systems that use radar, into thinking the car in front of it is speeding up, when it is not, resulting in a frontal collision.[^31]
In March 2024, security researchers from the University of California–Irvine and Japan’s Keio University detected 15 vulnerabilities in 9 commercially available, first- and next-gen LiDAR systems that can allow direct spoofing of fake cars and pedestrians and the vanishing of real cars in the AV’s eye. These attack capabilities on LiDAR sensors can be used to directly trigger various unsafe AV driving behaviors such as emergency brakes and front collisions.[^32]
In May 2024, security researchers from Singapore proved that it was possible to interfere with AVs by exploiting their reliance on camera-based computer vision, making them ignore road signs using LEDs. The researchers were able to distort the appearance of road signs repeatedly in a stable manner, ensuring that every frame captured was distorted. The team tested their system using a real road and car with a camera used by a prominent Chinese AV developer. Two versions of this stabilized attack were developed by the team. GhostStripe1, which does not require access to the vehicle, employs a tracking system to monitor the target vehicle's real-time location and dynamically adjusts the LED flickering accordingly to ensure a sign isn't read properly. GhostStripe2 requires access to the vehicle and involves placing a transducer—an electronic device that converts energy from one form to another—on the power wire of the camera to detect framing moments and refine timing control. The researchers claim GhostStripe1 and GhostStripe2 had success rates of 94% and 97%, respectively.[^33]
In May 2024, security researchers from the University of Buffalo uncovered a vulnerability in multi-sensor fusion systems—a technology that integrates data from LiDAR, cameras, and radar sensors, and is commonly used in AVs. The researchers introduced a sophisticated attack method capable of simultaneously compromising all three sensor types using a single adversarial object. This object can be easily and inexpensively fabricated, allowing the attack to be executed with a high degree of stealth and flexibility. By deploying just two small adversarial objects, the researchers demonstrated that the attack could effectively render a target vehicle invisible to the victim AV’s perception systems.[^34]
Multi-sensor fusion has long been considered an adequate cybersecurity counter measure as multiple sensor types provide redundancy, compensating for any compromised sensor. The researchers findings show that this is no longer the case—with attackers capable of simultaneously compromising multiple sensor types.
In June 2024 (published in September 2024), security researchers discovered vulnerabilities in a Korean OEM's dealer API, allowing them to take over vehicles using only their license plates.
The researchers went as far as building a proof-of-concept attack UI consisting of a VIN Retriever tool that converts license plate number to VIN using a third-party API; an Exploit module which can be used to takeover a victim’s vehicle—or passively steal vehicle owner PII including name, email and phone number; and a Garage module, which can be used to issue commands and locate impacted vehicles.[^35]
According to the researchers, “from the victim’s side, there was no notification that their vehicle had been accessed nor their access permissions modified. An attacker could resolve someone’s license plate, enter their VIN through the API, then track them passively and send active commands like unlock, start, or honk.”[^36]
The researchers informed the OEM, which fixed the vulnerabilities and validated that they were never exploited maliciously. This incident highlights the massive impact of API vulnerabilities and demonstrates how they would affect SDVs at scale.
In June 2024, a security researcher identified a severe vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-35213 and assigned a CVSS score of 9.0 (critical), in the SGI Image Codec of a popular vehicle software development platform used in various automotive parts including infotainment, ADAS, telematics, and autonomous driving. Successful exploitation of CVE-2024-35213 could lead to software-driven system crashes, disruptions in image processing services, or the execution of unauthorized code.[^37]
In September 2024, security researchers published research investigating the impact of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, specifically Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flood attacks, on Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, focusing on their control modules. Two experimental setups were created: the first involved an ICMP flood attack on a Raspberry Pi running an AD software stack, and the second examined the effects of single and double attacker ICMP flood attacks on a Global Navigation Satellite System Real-Time Kinematic (GNSS-RTK) device for high-accuracy positioning of an autonomous vehicle that is available on the market. DoS attacks only had a marginal impact on the AD stack, indicating a degree of resilience to these types of attacks. GNSS devices, however, showed significant vulnerabilities: under DoS attacks, sample rates dropped to about 50% and 5% of the nominal rate, respectively, for single and double attacker configurations.[^38]
The results of this research have significant implications, as it shows that while the AD software stack can handle DoS attacks with minimal performance degradation, critical external components like GNSS-RTK devices are highly vulnerable. The GNSS system's vulnerability highlights a critical gap in AD system resilience, especially for real-time positioning hardware that could lead to incorrect vehicle positioning, directly affecting the safety and operational reliability of autonomous vehicles.
Recently and with the rising impact of geopolitical conflicts, Upstream’s vSOC team identified GNSS spoofing at multiple OEMs across various regions worldwide.[^39] False coordinates negatively impact consumer experience of being unable to properly track their vehicles, but may also disrupt customer operations, particularly related to fleet management.Furthermore, GNSS spoofing may introduce safety risks, for example preventing first responders from providing assistance in case of an accident due to false location coordinates.[^40]
