## Executive Summary
The explosive growth of SaaS, the surge in Shadow IT, and the rapid adoption of AI have created a tsunami of 
risks that many organizations are unprepared to handle. Businesses are now heavily reliant on SaaS, and as 
these apps become more accessible, employees are increasingly bypassing IT departments, resulting in a flood 
of unmonitored and unsecured software. 

This report takes a comprehensive look at how shadow SaaS and shadow AI are reshaping the security 
landscape. Using anonymized data from the SaaS Security Control Plane (SSCP) deployments, Grip analyzed 
over 29 million SaaS user accounts, 1.7 million identities, and 23,987 distinct SaaS applications to understand the 
scale and nature of these risks. The findings highlight a growing challenge: traditional security measures are no 
longer enough to protect organizations from "SaaS risk creep," the slow but steady accumulation of 
vulnerabilities that arise from unmanaged apps and the user accounts tied to them. 
As organizations increasingly manage more SaaS apps and user accounts than ever before, a new strategic 
approach is essential. Gartner projects that by 2027, 75% of employees will use technology outside of IT's 
purview. This shift demands more than just monitoring—it requires a complete rethinking of SaaS security to 
address the nuances of shadow SaaS and shadow AI. Without adapting to these changes, enterprises face an 
expanding gap between perceived security and the reality of unmonitored risk. A flexible, identity-centric 
approach that empowers employees while controlling risk is the only way forward in this evolving landscape.

tech optimization
Shadow SaaS and shadow AI are grossly 
underestimated and pose more significant risks than 
most organizations realize. As the number of 
unsanctioned apps and AI grows, so does the 
organization's exposure to potential security breaches. 
While tech consolidation has been a popular strategy, 
employee behavior tells a different story. As employees 
independently adopt new SaaS tools, many of the SaaS 
licenses provisioned for them go unused. This creates a 
dual problem of risk exposure and financial waste, 
underscoring the need to optimize tech usage rather 
than just reduce tools.

## SaaS Adoption Continues to Grow
As the SaaS market grew, so did adoption in the workforce.  

A trend that started during the pandemic has led to a surge in employees acquiring their own SaaS tools, 
driving a spike in SaaS usage organization-wide. Remote workers found it easy and convenient to start 
cloud subscriptions independently without consulting IT. According to industry data, SaaS adoption 
skyrocketed 62% in the first year of COVID lockdowns (2019-2020) and grew another 28% the following 
year. Despite previous efforts to consolidate technologies, decentralized SaaS gained momentum, a trend 
that continues today. Consequently, organizations now have more SaaS apps and identities than ever 
before, most of which were procured by employees or functional teams outside of IT’s visibility. 

## SaaS App Stats
In 2023, small companies used 411 apps, 
medium companies 582 apps, and large 
companies 1,437 apps. These figures 
represent a substantial increase from 2022, 
an average increase of 40%.  
Analyzing the data by company size reveals that medium-sized companies adopted SaaS at the highest 
rate, a 47% increase, compared to 35% for small companies and 37% for large companies. This variance 
may be attributed to the unique position of medium-sized companies, as they often lack the robust 
governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) functions that large companies possess, making them more 
agile and open to adopting new tools. Conversely, they are not small enough to rely on a single team's 
consensus for tool usage, necessitating a broader range of applications to meet diverse needs.

## SaaS Adoption by Industry
SaaS adoption surged across all industries, reflecting a broader trend as companies strive to stay 
competitive, adapt to changing market demands, and increasingly rely on cloud-based solutions. Between 
Q1 2023 and Q1 2024, sectors like software, insurance, and business services substantially increased SaaS 
usage, driven by the need for scalable solutions to enhance efficiency and foster innovation. 
Director of IT and Security
> What surprised us was just how 
much our SaaS and identity 
landscape changed day-to-day 
and week-to-week.

The software industry, already at the forefront of technological advancements, relies on SaaS to enhance 
collaboration and streamline development processes. Insurance companies leverage SaaS tools to improve 
customer service, claims processing, and regulatory compliance. Meanwhile, business service organizations 
are adopting SaaS to optimize operational workflows and offer more dynamic service offerings. As these 
sectors expand their SaaS portfolios, implementing strong security and governance measures becomes 
critical to managing the associated risks.

## SaaS per Employee - Provisioned vs. Used
The number of SaaS applications per employee has steadily risen, marking an 85% increase in 
managed SaaS tools usage when broken down by individual users. In 2022, employees used an 
average of 7 tools, which rose to 11 in 2023 and increased to 13 by early 2024. This trend 
highlights the growing reliance on SaaS applications as an integral component of an employee’s 
daily workflow. 
However, the data also reveals discrepancies between provisioned SaaS licenses and actual usage. While 
IT teams provision 30 SaaS tools on average for employees, they use only 13 on average. This gap between 
the number of tools employees are given and the number they actually use results in overspending on 
licenses for software that isn't fully utilized. This discrepancy becomes even more critical at a time when 
tech spending is under intense scrutiny.  

To illustrate, a large enterprise leveraged Grip to audit the usage of Adobe licenses. Based on their findings, 
they were able to reclaim unused SaaS licenses and re-negotiate their software contract, saving them 
almost a million dollars annually. 

The above example is not uncommon. When isolating usage data for managed applications, Grip research 
shows that, on average, 73% of provisioned users never utilized their application license. This indicates that 
even managed SaaS tools are not adequately monitored and maintained, leading to significant security 
and compliance risks, wasted budget dollars, and operational inefficiencies.  
![Managed SaaS Apps per Employee]
P.7
Grip 2025 SaaS Security Risks Report
Organizations must prioritize gaining visibility into all identities across the enterprise to reduce security risks 
and optimize tech expenditures. It is also essential to implement ongoing monitoring to regularly prune 
unused accounts and identify account usage and activity changes to ensure that all managed applications 
and identities remain secure. Through comprehensive SaaS management practices, organizations can 
protect against potential breaches and control technology spending even as the SaaS landscape changes 
and identities grow.  

## Sprawling SaaS Accounts & Identities
While the number of SaaS applications in use has experienced explosive growth, an equally important trend 
is the significant increase in the number of SaaS accounts. Unlike the sheer count of different apps, SaaS 
accounts refer to the number of individuals accessing a single application. This figure is typically higher than 
the number of SaaS applications within an organization, as a single tool can have multiple users. For instance, 
consider Microsoft Office—while it's counted as one SaaS application, it can support many users within the 
same organization, reflecting a much larger user base than the number of applications alone. 

While the average SaaS portfolio or number of applications used within an enterprise illustrates the growing 
reliance on cloud-based solutions to manage diverse business functions, the exponential growth in accounts 
demonstrates the increased risks to an organization’s attack surface. Each account signifies a user with 
specific roles, responsibilities, and access levels, contributing to the overall complexity of SaaS identity risk 
management. As organizations onboard more users onto these applications, the challenges of securing, 
managing, and optimizing SaaS accounts become more pronounced. 
P.8
Grip 2025 SaaS Security Risks Report
Head of Information Security 
> It’s a difficult balance to enable 
a highly distributed workforce 
with such diversity of tools and 
SaaS apps in use.

Managing this surge in SaaS accounts means organizations must prioritize effective account 
governance to safeguard their digital assets and maintain operational integrity. The growing 
number of accounts also necessitates regular audits and reviews to identify inactive or redundant 
accounts, which can pose additional security vulnerabilities and inflate technology costs. 

## SaaS Realizations
The heightened adoption of SaaS emphasizes three key realizations: 
1. Organizations need streamlined, comprehensive, and systematic security 
measures to manage the expanding SaaS landscape, particularly the apps 
acquired outside IT’s visibility and bypass traditional security reviews. 
2. CISOs, responsible for mitigating risks and safeguarding their organization, now 
face increased exposure and liability from SaaS employees adopt independently, 
outside their knowledge. 
3. As SaaS procurement behaviors shift, CISOs must transition from gatekeepers to 
secure innovation enablers. By embracing a programmatic approach towards 
decentralized SaaS adoption, CISOs can mitigate the risks while empowering 
business units to meet their technology needs. This means fostering collaboration, 
improving visibility into departmental technology acquisitions, and implementing 
robust governance frameworks that allow for secure and compliant use of 
unsanctioned tools.  
Grip 2025 SaaS Security Risks Report

## Organizations Struggle to Manage SaaS Growth
“Unmanaged SaaS” refers to any application not centrally monitored, 
maintained, or controlled by the organization's IT department, posing 
significant security risks and operational inefficiencies. The data clearly shows 
that SaaS management is a universal problem.  

Regardless of an organization's size, securing SaaS environments is a struggle, 
especially as the use of SaaS tools skyrockets and employees start new 
subscriptions. Isolating baseline averages before adopting Grip, the data 
reveals that unmanaged SaaS far exceeded managed applications: managed 
SaaS hovered around 10-15%, and 85-90% of SaaS tools were unmanaged.  

While the importance of SaaS security is well-recognized, organizations face 
difficulties addressing it effectively. Technical debt, or the backlog of software 
and systems that have not been adequately managed, documented, or 
integrated over time, has long been thought to be the primary driver behind 
the high proportion of unmanaged SaaS. However, it is only one of the 
contributing factors. Looking at the initial baseline average and isolating SaaS 
onboarded in 2023 shows that 82-90% of new applications were unmanaged, 
a consistent trend across different company sizes. Underlying causes include a 
lack of awareness of the SaaS tools used across an enterprise, understaffed IT 
teams, and, once SaaS is discovered, technical limitations such as applications 
not supporting SAML or imposing high premiums for it.  

Digging deeper and further analyzing both managed and unmanaged 
applications, we found that 27% of unmanaged apps were verified to support 
SAML, though it wasn’t enabled. Of the managed applications, 63% have 
semi-managed user access, meaning a social login is being used, and 53% are 
accessed using local app credentials or a user-defined login and password.

The data paints a clear picture: there’s a massive gap in SaaS governance. 
Users independently acquire applications that are not federated and create 
their own credentials, which often fail to comply with strict organizational 
policies. This practice opens up significant security vulnerabilities, exacerbated 
by common issues such as password reuse, weak password choices, and 
access from unmanaged or personal devices. Industry data cites that only 12% 
of users consistently use different passwords, and over half of users (52%) use 
easily guessable information, such as pet names or “123456”, making it easy for 
cybercriminals to crack their passwords.   
P.9
Grip 2025 SaaS Security Risks Report
Governance gaps expand when unmanaged or personal 
devices are used to access corporate applications. 
Compromised credentials were responsible for 19% of data 
breaches in 2023, showcasing the significant impact weak 
password practices can have on overall security. Improving 
password hygiene and implementing robust identity 
security governance are essential steps to mitigate these 
risks and protect organizational data. 

As the "business-led IT” trend grows, organizations must 
approach SaaS identity management using systematic, 
data-driven processes to mitigate SaaS risk creep and 
address operational inefficiencies. The primary challenge 
stems from a lack of visibility into the applications used 
across an organization. Shadow SaaS—tools that 
employees adopt independently without IT oversight—
means that IT departments are often unaware of the full 
scope of SaaS applications in use, making it difficult to 
implement comprehensive security measures and 
governance protocols. 

Additionally, security teams frequently rely on SaaS 
Security Posture Management (SSPM) tools, which, while 
useful for managing known SaaS applications, fail to 
detect shadow SaaS. Similarly, Cloud Access Security 
Brokers (CASBs) are designed to provide visibility and 
control over cloud services but often generate excessive 
data noise and false positives, which are overwhelming 
and time-consuming for security teams to sift through. This 
makes it challenging to extract actionable insights and 
address SaaS security risks effectively, often resulting in a 
reactive response vs. a proactive one. Only by addressing 
these core issues can organizations manage their 
expanding SaaS environments, contain risk creep, and 
mitigate the associated risks. 
P.10
Defining Unmanaged, 
Managed, and Tolerated SaaS 
The terms used to describe the status of SaaS 
within an organization are defined as: 
**Tolerated SaaS** includes applications that are known 
and approved (sanctioned) but are deemed to 
represent low risk, so they are not actively managed. 
- Known and approved by the organization, though 
the organization has opted not to take action.
- Considered low risk, hence not actively monitored.
- Sanctioned, but not centrally governed like 
managed SaaS.
- Can still pose risks as SaaS usage changes. 
**Unmanaged SaaS** includes shadow IT and SaaS 
applications that the organization does not centrally 
monitor or govern access. These apps are often 
called "unfederated" SaaS.
- Shadow SaaS and unapproved applications.
- Not monitored or governed by IT.
- Poses significant security and compliance risks. 
**Managed SaaS** refers to applications known and 
governed by the organization. These applications 
use Single Sign-On (SSO) or Identity Providers (IdP) 
and are often termed "federated" SaaS.
- Known and governed by IT.
- Uses SSO or IdP for secure access.
- Actively monitored and managed for 
security and compliance. 
P.11
Grip 2025 SaaS Security Risks Report

## SaaS Risk Management Varies by Industry
Managed applications vary significantly across industries, reflecting their distinct operational needs, 
priorities, and SaaS adoption rates.  

As an example, only 4.2% of SaaS applications in the construction industry are managed, suggesting 
a substantial gap in oversight and control. However, SaaS adoption is also lower than in other 
verticals, indicating that this industry may be less dependent on SaaS and, therefore, less concerned 
about managing it. 

Conversely, a major SaaS adopter, such as the insurance industry, demonstrates a much higher level 
of SaaS management, with 21% of applications actively managed. This contrast highlights the 
varying maturity levels in SaaS governance across industries. Sectors subject to regulatory 
compliance standards prioritize SaaS security more rigorously than others.  
P.12
Grip 2025 SaaS Security Risks Report

## Some Apps are Better Managed Than Others
Analyzing SaaS applications by type vs. their management status reveals a distinct pattern.  The data 
shows a slightly higher concentration of managed IT, production, and security apps, with management 
rates between 16% and 22%. In contrast, marketing apps, many of which are niche apps with few users, are 
among the lowest concentration of managed apps (5.8%) and a high volume of shadow SaaS (94.2%). 
Other sensitive applications, such as those containing financial data, are also managed significantly less 
often (7%), highlighting a critical oversight in SaaS risk management.
The data suggests that IT and security teams, which are usually part of the procurement process, are more 
apt to follow SaaS review protocols. However, they lack awareness of SaaS usage in other areas, likely 
from functional teams sidestepping the established procurement and security reviews. As a result, IT and 
security teams may not fully grasp the extent of shadow SaaS and the risks within their organization. 

The 2024 MarTech Composability Survey found that 83% of marketers chose an alternative app even 
though the primary, sanctioned tool had the same functionality. The survey also found that SaaS app 
selection varied by individual preference, explaining the high amount of shadow SaaS in our findings.

## The Prevalence of Shadow SaaS
Organizations often misjudge the volume of shadow SaaS that 
exists in their SaaS environment, leading to significant oversight 
in managing risks and maintaining security. These unapproved 
applications fly under the radar, bypassing traditional security 
protocols, undetected by identity management tools, and 
leaving critical data vulnerable. The lack of visibility into these 
tools means that organizations may not fully understand the 
scale of shadow SaaS within their environment, which can 
include hundreds or thousands of unmonitored apps. 

As evidence, Okta’s Businesses at Work 2024 report cites that, 
on average, organizations use 93 SaaS applications, all of 
which are managed. However, Grip’s research uncovered an 
average of 835 SaaS applications, almost ten times more. The 
delta, 742 applications, represents unmanaged shadow SaaS, 
illustrating the vast gap in SaaS visibility.

### Shadow SaaS is Grossly Underestimated
Shadow SaaS is a more significant issue than most 
organizations realize. Shadow SaaS proliferates as 
employees and functional teams acquire tools outside 
of IT’s visibility, now exceeding the known SaaS 
applications in an organization’s SaaS ecosystem. 

As an example, Grip uncovered nearly seven times 
more SaaS applications than a mid-size company’s 
security team was aware of, along with active 
accounts belonging to former employees. 
In addition to shadow SaaS, employees are also 
adopting other resources, such as IaaS tenants and 
AWS tenants independently; in an engagement with a 
Fortune 300 organization, the security team believed 
they had 35 AWS accounts. Grip uncovered ten times 
that amount, or 350 active tenants. 

These examples illustrate how widespread 
shadow SaaS has become and the limited 
visibility security teams have.

## The Shadow AI Boom: Rapid Growth and Unseen Risks
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has taken the world by storm, starting with the ChatGPT craze and 
followed by a flurry of AI-powered features in other apps. GenAI is now mainstream, and users are indulging. 
Bloomberg predicts the AI market will skyrocket from $40 billion in 2022 to $1.3 trillion by 2032. However, as GenAI 
adoption soared, company policies lagged. The Conference Board reports that 57% of organizations lack an AI 
policy to guide their employees, highlighting a critical gap in GenAI app governance.

## Accelerated Adoption: Tools and Users
The accelerated adoption of AI tools across industries is reshaping how businesses operate and compete. 
Grip’s research highlights a steady and consistent rise in personal usage of AI apps over the last two years, 
with a slight upward trend in new users. This steady increase suggests that AI adoption is not just a spike of 
interest but a sustained and linear growth in active usage. 

What’s particularly noteworthy is that this trend pertains to actual usage, not just provisioned or granted 
access. This means that the focus is on active users who are engaging with and sharing data through AI 
tools, highlighting the practical integration of AI into daily workflows. As AI becomes more embedded into 
business operations, organizations need to be aware of the potential risks associated with widespread 
adoption. While AI offers numerous benefits, the rapid growth in its use and the challenges of managing AI-
driven data present new security and governance concerns that cannot be overlooked.

P.15
Grip 2025 SaaS Security Risks Report
This chart highlights the user growth of AI tools, excluding AI features within large SaaS applications 
like Microsoft, Adobe, Atlassian, and Google. In the 3rd quarter of 2022, coinciding with the launch of 
ChatGPT, there were only 1,876 users of AI tools. By the following quarter, that number had risen to 
4,641; by the 1st quarter of 2024, the user count had surged to 44,440. This surge represents another 
significant challenge: many of the smaller, niche AI apps remain undetected and unmanaged by 
legacy security tools, further expanding an organization’s attack surface. 

## The Most Widely Used AI Tools
Looking at all AI tools, the most widely used AI tools are embedded within corporate-sanctioned 
platforms, although they aren't explicitly recognized as "AI tools." Major players like Microsoft, 
Google, Zoom, and Adobe lead the pack, with the data showing that 97-100% of organizations 
analyzed have provisioned usage of these tools.  

Other commonly provisioned AI tools include GitHub and Canva (83% each), Grammarly (82%), 
Notion (73%), and Jasper (39%). 
P.16
Grip 2025 SaaS Security Risks Report

### ChatGPT
ChatGPT has been criticized for security concerns, including data privacy issues and potential data leaks, 
leading to a ban in several prominent public organizations and government agencies. However, it was still 
present in 96% of the organizations analyzed. 

Here, we can see ChatGPT’s user adoption trend since its launch in December 2022; ChatGPT usage has 
increased 24x in less than two years. Yet, despite its capability to be more tightly controlled, it is managed 
at a slightly lower rate (9%) than the average SaaS application (13%). 

## AI Apps are Hot but Remain in the Shadows
Grip’s research also found that “major” or corporate SaaS applications with AI features, those with large user 
bases and subject to traditional procurement and security reviews (examples: Salesforce, Zoom, and 
Microsoft), are managed at a higher rate compared to the smaller, niche apps with fewer users, such as 
Canva and Grammarly.  

Additionally, Grip data reveals that 42% of popular AI apps have SAML capabilities; however, 80% of AI apps 
that could be centrally managed and federated with the SAML protocol are not. The low management rate 
may stem from the security team's lack of visibility into which apps have AI capabilities or the app is low 
risk, so it is tolerated but not centrally managed. 
P.17
Grip 2025 SaaS Security Risks Report
The high percentage of AI applications that lack SAML 
support (58%) introduces significant security challenges, as 
identity management systems cannot govern or secure 
these apps. Many of the newer AI tools, particularly those 
not primarily focused on enterprise customers, haven't yet 
integrated this essential security feature. As a result, 
organizations allowing employees to use these AI apps for 
productivity gains risk expanding their attack surface and 
introducing blind spots into their identity security programs. 
Without proper governance, these tools become potential 
entry points for threat actors, making it critical for 
companies to weigh the benefits of AI apps against the 
security risks they pose. 

## Managed Apps Still Present Risks
High-profile breaches such as Microsoft Midnight Blizzard and Snowflake illustrate the dangers of 
forgotten and abandoned software accounts and dangling user access. Grip data revealed that 16% of 
managed applications were abandoned in 2023 yet remained connected to core systems.  
P.18
Grip 2025 SaaS Security Risks Report
Abandoned user accounts are likely resulting from two key trends. With workforce reductions 
surging in 2023, labor-intensive manual offboarding processes often couldn't keep up. The problem 
was further worsened by a lack of visibility into shadow IT, preventing security teams from revoking 
access to unknown accounts. 

The other contributing factor to the high abandon rate is the easy access to apps, enabling 
employees to trial multiple apps and choose the one they prefer. Then, when a new option is 
introduced, they may again try the alternative and shift from one tool to another. 

By failing to manage abandoned accounts and revoking dangling access, companies expose 
themselves to heightened security risks and undermine their financial health. Abandoned accounts, 
often left active after employees leave or roles change, can be exploited by cybercriminals to gain 
unauthorized access to sensitive data. The Microsoft breach, in which a forgotten test account was 
inadvertently left active, is a harsh reminder that no organization is immune to the risks posed by 
unmonitored accounts.

## Conclusion
As the SaaS landscape evolves, so must the security measures organizations use to protect their 
environments. Despite billions spent on addressing SaaS-related risks, the data shows that the 
problems haven’t been solved.  

The high volume of shadow SaaS underscores the primary issue: a lack of visibility into SaaS usage. 
Additionally, the prevalence of SAML-supporting apps without enabled security features highlights 
the challenge of prioritizing which applications pose the most significant risks and determining the 
right actions to mitigate them.

P.19
Grip 2025 SaaS Security Risks Report
Traditional tools like CASBs have been relied upon but have proven ineffective because SaaS 
applications disrupt conventional network and endpoint monitoring models. Furthermore, the 
excessive data noise and false positives generated by these tools prevent teams from identifying 
and addressing the issues that genuinely demand their attention. 

Organizations today are SaaS-reliant, and employees want the freedom and flexibility to choose 
their tools. According to analysts, business-led IT is one of the top drivers impacting information 
security, emphasizing the urgent need for organizations to adopt a more pragmatic approach to 
managing the risks of the new SaaS era. 

Responsibility can no longer rest solely on IT and security teams; a collaborative effort involving the 
appropriate stakeholders, including business app owners and end users, is essential to effectively 
manage SaaS risks at scale. 

Without a change in strategy, organizations will remain vulnerable to significant security breaches. 
High-profile incidents like those at Snowflake and Microsoft are stark reminders of the potential 
consequences of unmanaged SaaS environments, shadow SaaS, and dangling access. Enterprises 
that proactively adapt to changing SaaS trends will be better positioned to protect their sensitive 
data, ensure compliance with evolving regulations, optimize their financial resources, and enable 
innovation while mitigating the associated risks of a SaaS-driven business world. 

## Methodology
The SaaS Adoption and Security Risks Report provides an in-depth view of SaaS usage trends, 
security practices, and risk management across a wide range of industries and organization sizes. 
This report is based on anonymized customer data from Grip SaaS Security Control Plane (SSCP) 
deployments, encompassing over 29 million SaaS user accounts, 1.7 million identities, and 23,987
