Homeland Threat Assessment 2025

Scope

Note

The Office of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security presents the 2025 Homeland Threat Assessment, which provides insights from across the Department and other homeland security stakeholders to identify the most direct, pressing threats to our Homeland during the next fiscal year (FY). This Assessment organizes evolving threats to homeland security missions arising from the dynamic terrorist threat, the increasing complexities straining the immigration system, transnational organized crime, proliferating cyber threats, and geopolitical strategic competition into four sections: Public Safety and Security, Border and Immigration Security, Critical Infrastructure Security, and Economic Security. This Assessment employs a traditional intelligence assessment format in which summary assessment paragraphs are followed by bullets with additional details that underpin the assessment.

We note that many of the threat actors and efforts addressed in this Assessment appear in multiple sections as they cut across mission areas and interact in complex and, at times, reinforcing ways. Throughout this Assessment, we also examine enduring issues, such as the development and proliferation of new technologies and climate change, which involve various mission areas and impact multiple threats. Definitions for terms and additional contextual notes are included at the end of this document.

Executive Summary

The Homeland faces a complex set of threats to our public safety, border security, critical infrastructure, and economy from violent extremists, transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), adversarial nation-states, and malicious cyber actors. These threats, while varied in scope and intended purpose, at times compound one another in unexpected ways, harming our communities and generating costly disruptions to the US economy. Meanwhile, technological advances, climate change, and natural disasters have the potential to exacerbate many of the aforementioned threats.

PUBLIC SAFETY AND SECURITY: Over the next year, the terrorism threat environment in the Homeland will remain high. We are particularly concerned about a confluence of factors this year, including violent extremist responses to domestic sociopolitical developments—especially the 2024 election cycle—and international events that domestic and foreign violent extremists likely will use to justify or encourage attacks in the Homeland. Lone offenders and small groups continue to pose the greatest threat of carrying out attacks with little to no warning. Meanwhile, foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs) and their supporters will maintain their enduring intent to conduct or inspire attacks in the Homeland.

In addition, the production, trafficking, and sale of illegal drugs by transnational and domestic criminal actors will continue to pose the most lethal threat to communities in the United States. Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids remain the most lethal of drugs trafficked into the country, but small increases in overdoses linked to cocaine and methamphetamine highlight the danger from other drug types.

We expect the Homeland also will face threats to public safety from state actors using subversive tactics in an effort to influence and divide the American public and undermine confidence in our institutions. Many of these actors—in particular, the People’s Republic of China (PRC)—also target
v
U.S. Department of Homeland Security

ethnic and religious minorities, political dissidents, and journalists in the United States to silence and harass critical voices, violating our sovereignty and the rule of law.

The 2024 election cycle will be an attractive target for many adversaries. Some domestic violent extremists (DVEs) likely view a wide range of targets indirectly and directly associated with elections as viable targets for violence with the intent of instilling fear among voters, candidates, and election workers, as well as disrupting election processes leading up to and after the November election. Nation-state-aligned foreign malign influence actors almost certainly will continue to target democratic processes with the aims of affecting US voter preferences, exacerbating social tensions, and undermining confidence in our democratic institutions and the integrity of the electoral process.

BORDER AND IMMIGRATION SECURITY: Migrant encounters at our border have declined over the last year, but migrants are still arriving in high numbers, complicating border and immigration security. As overall encounters have declined, so too have encounters with individuals in the Terrorist Screening Data Set, also known as the “terrorism watchlist,” which includes individuals associated with information indicating they may be directly engaged in or supporting terrorist activities as well as known associates of watchlisted individuals, such as family members. For several years prior to this year's decline, terrorism watchlist encounters had increased, a trend consistent with the overall increase in migrant encounters at the southwest border.

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY: Domestic and foreign adversaries almost certainly will continue to threaten the integrity of our critical infrastructure with disruptive and destructive cyber and physical attacks, in part, because they perceive targeting these sectors will have cascading impacts on US industries and our standard of living. The PRC, Russia, and Iran will remain the most pressing foreign threats to our critical infrastructure. Most concerningly, we expect the PRC to continue its efforts to pre-position on US networks for potential cyber attacks in the event of a conflict with the United States. Nation-states, criminal hacktivists, and financially motivated criminals will likely hone their techniques to disrupt US services or to conduct espionage focused on gaining access to US networks, including critical infrastructure entities. We assess that domestic and foreign violent extremists will continue to call for physical attacks on critical infrastructure in furtherance of their ideological goals and, at times, in response to international conflicts and crises.

ECONOMIC SECURITY: Multifaceted and diverse economic threats—primarily from the PRC—will likely continue to harm US producers and consumers and degrade the competitiveness and future health of US companies and industries. The PRC likely will remain our greatest economic security threat because of its aggressive use of anticompetitive, coercive policies and theft of US intellectual property, technology, and trade secrets. Lastly, we expect our supply chains will remain vulnerable to foreign manipulation abroad, which could harm global productivity and consumer demand.

# PUBLIC SAFETY AND SECURITY

1
U.S. Department of Homeland Security

Overview: Within this section, we examine lethal threats to the Homeland from terrorism and illegal drugs, and national security threats from nation-state efforts to malignly influence US audiences and suppress critical voices.

Over the next year, domestic and foreign violent extremist actors, the harmful effects of illegal drugs, and adversarial states seeking to exacerbate our divisions as well as silence criticism from diaspora communities will pose a threat to public safety and security in the Homeland. Specifically, we expect the terrorism threat environment in the United States over the next year will remain high due to a confluence of factors. These factors include violent extremist responses to domestic sociopolitical developments and the 2024 election cycle, the enduring intent of FTOs to conduct or inspire attacks in the Homeland, and the galvanizing effect that successful terrorist attacks abroad and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East have had on a range of violent actors.[^1],[^2] Despite the lethal

and destabilizing threat terrorism poses to our country, the production, trafficking, and sale of illegal drugs by transnational and domestic criminal actors remain the most lethal and persistent threats

to US communities. Concurrently, adversarial states are intent on sowing distrust in our institutions, as well as confusion and division in our communities, through their malign influence campaigns, with some actors seeking to boost these efforts during the 2024 election cycle. These state actors also violate our rule of law and undermine freedom of speech in their efforts to suppress dissidents living in the United States. (For more information on threats to the 2024 US election cycle, see page 10.)

Homeland Threat Assessment 2025

## Terrorism

Looking into 2025, the threat of violence from US-based violent extremists—including DVEs who are motivated by various ideologies and FTO-inspired homegrown violent extremists (HVEs)—will remain high.[^3],[^4] The threat will continue to be characterized primarily by lone offenders or small cells motivated to violence by a combination of racial, religious, gender, or anti-government grievances; conspiracy theories; and personalized factors.[^5],[^6] We particularly are concerned about the likelihood of violence motivated by developing domestic and global events, including the 2024 election cycle and the ongoing Israel-HAMAS conflict. A number of violent extremists embrace multiple, sometimes competing motivations, challenging our ability to identify their potential targets in advance because their pre-attack statements online are often unrelated or only loosely related to the targets they ultimately choose.

- Between September 2023 and July 2024, DVEs driven by various anti-government, racial, or gender-related motivations have conducted at least four attacks in the Homeland, one of which resulted in a death.[^7] US law enforcement disrupted at least seven additional DVE plots. Two HVE attacks, partially motivated by the Israel-HAMAS conflict, also occurred during this timeframe, and law enforcement disrupted at least three other HVE plots.
- Over the last year, DVE efforts have focused on a range of targets, including ethnic and religious minorities, government officials, and ideological opponents, while HVEs have mostly targeted faith-based organizations. Some of these incidents focused on less secure targets, like houses of worship, a store, and a university. DVEs motivated by various ideologies have also used online messaging to increasingly promote the swatting and doxxing of ideological opponents, including public and private officials at their residences.[^8] Other DVE-related violent threats have targeted court officers associated with divisive sociopolitical cases; migrants and government officials linked to immigration grievances; and Jewish, Muslim, and Arab communities, partly in response to the Israel-HAMAS conflict.
- DVEs and HVEs will continue to be influenced by sociopolitical drivers emphasized in popular discourse, particularly those related to current events, which are used to amplify existing narratives and justify violence. HAMAS’s terrorist attack against Israel on 7 October 2023 and the subsequent conflict between Israel and HAMAS and its regional allies have spurred violent extremists across the ideological spectrum to promote attacks against Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and Arab communities in the United States. These events will likely be referenced in FTOs’ official and unofficial messaging and contribute to the radicalization and mobilization of US-based individuals to violence into at least 2025.[^9]

Targeted Violence

In contrast to DVE and HVE attacks, most mass casualty attacks in the Homeland
3
U.S. Department of Homeland Security

over the last year were not motivated by an ideology, but were rather associated with suspected or confirmed mental illness or driven by relationship grievances; however, these factors alone are not diagnostic indicators of likely violence.[^10] Over the last year, at least eight mass casualty attacks primarily motivated by reasons other than an ideology have occurred in the United States, killing at least 38 and injuring 68. Individuals acting alone conducted most of these attacks while using firearms and targeting commercial and education facilities. At least one of these attackers cited the 1999 Columbine School shooting as inspiration, suggesting that tragic incident will continue inspiring threat actors in the years to come.

FTOs, like ISIS and al-Qa‘ida, maintain the enduring intent to conduct or inspire attacks in the Homeland and have leveraged the conflict in the Middle East to reaffirm this intent. These organizations maintain worldwide networks of supporters that could target the Homeland. FTO media outlets promote violent rhetoric intended to inspire US persons to mobilize to violence, while foreign terrorists continue engaging online supporters to solicit funds; create and share media; and encourage followers to attack the Homeland, US interests, and what they perceive as the West. Additionally, individuals with terrorism connections are interested in using established travel routes and perceived permissive environments to facilitate their access to the United States. (For more information on terrorist watchlist encounters at the US border, see page 15.) Among state actors, we expect Iran to remain the primary sponsor of terrorism and continue its efforts to advance plots against individuals—including current and former US officials—in the United States.

- Following ISIS’s loss of territorial control in the Middle East in 2019 and three of its most senior leaders in 2022, ISIS’s branches have taken a greater role in conducting operations on behalf of the group. ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K)—ISIS’s regional branch in Afghanistan and Pakistan—has been increasingly active outside of Afghanistan this year and will likely try to capitalize on its notable 2024 attacks in Iran and Russia to recruit followers in the Homeland and the West, as well as inspire individuals to mobilize to violence. These attacks, which killed more than 95 and 140 people, respectively, were the first major attacks conducted outside of the group's traditional operating area in several years, and were the most recent examples of ISIS-K’s successful recruitment of Central Asian supporters for attacks abroad. ISIS-K’s online media, particularly its multilingual Voice of Khurasan magazine, continues to emphasize the group’s intent to reach global audiences and galvanize supporters among Central Asian communities, including diaspora populations in other countries. ISIS online media groups have also used the Israel-HAMAS conflict to encourage attacks against the West and Jewish and Christian communities, and ISIS media outlets have capitalized on recent attacks in Europe to inspire more violent action.
- Al-Qa‘ida remains committed to striking the Homeland and has reinvigorated its outreach to Western audiences. In December 2023, al-Qa‘ida’s affiliate in Yemen released its first Inspire-branded video and the first Inspire publication since 2021, which encouraged attacks against civil aviation and prominent individuals, urged retaliation against the West for supporting Israel, and provided bomb-making instructions. Al-Qa‘ida has also been inspired by the HAMAS attack against Israel and directed its supporters to conduct attacks against the Homeland, Jewish targets, and Israel.
- Iran maintains its intent to kill US government officials it deems responsible for the 2020 death of its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)-Qods Force Commander and designated foreign terrorist Qassem Soleimani. In August 2024, a Pakistani national with ties to Iran was indicted for a planned assassination of US government officials. In June 2023, the US Department of the Treasury designated six IRGC members for their role in assassination plots targeting former US government officials, dual US and Iranian nationals, and Iranian dissidents.

Threats To Endure

Homeland Threat Assessment 2025

U.S. Department of Homeland Security

We expect predominantly aspirational and rudimentary interest in CBRN attacks will continue in 2025. Among foreign and domestic threat actors, we assess that DVEs and criminals will remain the most likely perpetrators of deliberate CBRN-related attacks. Over the last year, there were 18 known deliberate chemical- or biological-related incidents in the Homeland, four of which were linked to political or ideological motives while the rest were criminal in nature. All of the incidents employed simple methods, and one incident caused at least one death. Two of the 18 incidents involved the alleged use of ricin, while 14 of the incidents employed easily obtainable chemicals—including a range of pesticides, chlorine, bear spray, and other chemical irritants. Fentanyl was weaponized in two instances. Foreign and domestic threat actors maintain aspirational interest in radiological and nuclear attacks, but these attacks remain unlikely.

We expect threat actors will continue to explore emerging and advanced technologies to aid their efforts in developing and carrying out chemical and biological attacks. Over the last year, foreign and domestic extremists online expressed interest in using DNA modification to develop biological weapons to target specific groups. We remain concerned about the potential exploitation of advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to proliferate knowledge that supports the development of novel chemical or biological agents. (For more information on AI and threat actors, see pages 26–27.) Such advances could be exploited by state and state-sponsored adversaries, but the necessary expertise for such exploitation most likely exceeds that of most nonstate actors. We also remain concerned about the potential for threat actors to use unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in chemical or biological attacks due to the continued advancement of UAS technology and the growing availability of UAS.

## Illegal Drugs

6
Homeland Threat Assessment 2025

We expect illegal drugs smuggled into and sold in the United States will continue to kill more Americans than any other harmful security threat. Drug consumption kills tens of thousands of Americans each year, although drug overdoses tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declined in 2023 for the first time since 2018. While fentanyl seizure volumes are significantly below those of methamphetamine and cocaine, fentanyl remains a top concern due to its potency, lethality, and availability.[^11] Fentanyl seizures have declined this year from record high seizures in FY 2023, but still remain elevated. DHS still seized enough fentanyl to kill the entire American population many times over. Criminal actors and criminal drug manufacturers are responding to increased US and partner nation efforts targeting the precursor chemicals needed for fentanyl production by modifying existing chemicals and substituting different chemicals in their drug compositions. Criminals also are adapting their smuggling methods to circumvent US customs regulations aimed at blocking the import of these chemicals and drug manufacturing equipment into the United States. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in FY 2024 year-to-date has also seized more methamphetamine at the US-Mexico border than in all of FY 2023, and we noted small increases in overdoses related to both cocaine and methamphetamine.

- We expect US-bound fentanyl smuggling and seizures to remain high into 2025 as Mexico-based TCOs seek to meet user demand and the drug remains profitable. So far into FY 2024, CBP and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) seizures of fentanyl and pill presses—which traffickers use to make toxic drug mixtures that often include fentanyl—have declined compared to 2023, but still remain elevated. In the first 10 months of FY 2024, DHS seized over 27,000 pounds of fentanyl, compared to the over 43,000 pounds seized in 2023, a decline of nearly 40 percent. In this same timeframe, DHS seized 2,200 pill presses bound for the United States, down from the 3,600 pill presses seized in 2023. We note that seizure totals alone are not necessarily reflective of drug flow volumes.
- The Sinaloa Cartel and New Generation Jalisco Cartel, two large Mexico-based TCOs, remain the primary smugglers of fentanyl, methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin into the United States.[^12] These TCOs and others almost certainly will continue to rely on their vast illicit networks to obtain chemicals and finished drugs for the illicit US drug market. (For more information on TCO exploitation of the US border, see page 16.) Primarily US-based traffickers are also increasingly augmenting their fentanyl-related products with additives, such as xylazine, and fentanyl alternatives, such as nitazenes—both of which are sourced from China-based firms. Nitazene can be 10 times more potent than fentanyl alone. These addictive, inexpensive fentanyl combinations and alternatives increasingly contribute to overdoses in the Homeland.

- China-based companies that supply chemical precursors and pill pressing equipment, and the drug traffickers that seek to acquire these drug supplies, continue to adapt and use alternative routes and chemical compounds to mitigate increased US and third-country law enforcement efforts targeting the sale and import of these items. For example, this year, China shut down 25 companies selling fentanyl precursors and sent a warning to its pharmaceutical industry, which prompted suppliers to change tactics, such as modifying customs labeling on packages to avoid scrutiny. In 2024, traffickers increasingly used South Korea as an alternative transit point en route to Mexico or the United States in an attempt to obscure the origins of pill pressing equipment and evade law enforcement interdictions.
- In FY 2024, CBP seizures of methamphetamine have surpassed amounts seized in FY 2023, and we expect this will continue into the next year. Meanwhile, cocaine seizures remain high relative to other drugs but below totals for FY 2023. Drug traffickers will continue to produce and smuggle these drugs to meet sustained US consumer demand as long as they remain lucrative for TCOs. In contrast to overall overdose numbers, overdoses linked to methamphetamine and cocaine increased about 4 percent in 2023, in part due to consumer co-use of these drugs with fentanyl. In 2025, we expect that drug traffickers will continue to adulterate cocaine and methamphetamine to make them more potent and addictive.

## Nation‑States: Influence Operations and Transnational Repression

8
Homeland Threat Assessment 2025

We expect state actors will continue to pose a host of threats to the Homeland and public safety. Specifically, China, Iran, and Russia will use a blend of subversive, undeclared, criminal, and coercive tactics to seek new opportunities to undermine confidence in US democratic institutions and domestic social cohesion. Advances in AI likely will enable foreign adversaries to increase the output, timeliness, and perceived authenticity of their mis-, dis-, and malinformation designed to influence US audiences while concealing or distorting the origin of the content.[^13] (For more information on the use of AI by threat actors, see pages 26–27; for more on influence operations against the 2024 US election cycle, see pages 10–11.)[^14]

- Russia likely will continue to use traditional state-sponsored media, inauthentic websites, social media networks, online bots, trolls, and individuals to amplify pro-Kremlin narratives and conduct information operations targeting the United States. For example, over the past year, Russian influence actors have amplified stories regarding US migration flows to stoke discord in the United States. One Russian malign influence campaign used generative AI to create current event news articles on inauthentic websites designed to appear as recognizable Western and US-based media outlets.[^15]
- Since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s information operations have focused on justifying its actions and seeking to reduce US domestic and Western support for Kyiv. In support of these efforts, Moscow is also leveraging “influence-for-hire” firms—allegedly independent, nongovernment-linked entities—likely to reach larger US audiences and bolster operational security by concealing Moscow's ties with these firms’ promotion of pro-Kremlin narratives.
- Iran is becoming increasingly aggressive in its foreign influence efforts, seeking to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions. Over the last year, Iranian information operations have focused on weakening US public support for Israel and Israel’s response to the 7 October 2023 HAMAS terrorist attack. These efforts have included leveraging ongoing protests regarding the conflict, posing as activists online, and encouraging protests. Prior to the 2020 US presidential election, Iran also attempted to amplify divisive narratives to incite violence, influence the US electorate, and degrade trust in the electoral process.
- The PRC largely focuses its influence operations on discrediting the US government and enhancing Beijing’s global standing. To this end, it is improving its ability to develop, tailor, and disseminate disinformation using increasingly sophisticated tactics and technologies, including AI. For example, AI has enabled Beijing to improve the authenticity of social media accounts used in disinformation campaigns. The PRC is also conducting information operations targeting US disaster response operations, which could impact recovery activities and place emergency management personnel, facilities, and survivors at risk. PRC disinformation campaigns that seek to exploit US disasters, as when it blamed the Hawaii wildfires on US military activity, may also reduce trust in US institutions and officials and dissuade survivors from pursuing federal recovery response and support. (For more information on the PRC’s disinformation efforts, see pages 11 and 26.)

[^13]:
[^14]:
[^15]:

Nation-states also continue to engage in transnational repression activity targeting ethnic and religious minorities, political dissidents, and journalists in the United States.[^16] We expect China and Iran to remain the foremost transnational repression threats in the United States.

- The PRC continues its efforts to control and silence dissent and criticism abroad of the Chinese Communist Party and its General Secretary, Xi Jinping. In March 2024, the Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted seven China-based Chinese nationals for their involvement in a PRC-backed criminal hacking group targeting US-based critics, businesses, and political officials with malicious cyber operations intended to intimidate and silence dissidents and steal from their businesses. This group has been active for approximately 14 years, demonstrating the PRC’s commitment to monitoring and targeting US and foreign critics and bolstering our confidence that the PRC will continue to pursue perceived enemies in the Homeland.
- Iran almost certainly will continue to target US-based Iranian dissidents because Iran views their anti-regime activities as an existential threat. In the past several years, Iran has used US persons, Iranian diaspora members, and third-country nationals to surveil, harass, and intimidate regime dissidents. Iran’s use of violence—to include murder—against US-based regime opponents since the early days of the Iranian Revolution, and the regime’s global persecution of opponents, strengthens our assessment that it will continue to pursue dissidents in the Homeland.

[^16]:

Threat Actors Likely To Focus on 2024 Election Cycle

Our electoral processes are an attractive target for threat actors, and we expect many will seek to influence the 2024 election cycle, while some others may seek to access or interfere with election systems. While law enforcement is still investigating the motives behind the apparent assassination attempts on a former US President, these incidents highlight the magnitude of the threat surrounding the election cycle. Some DVEs, particularly those motivated by anti-government or partisan issues, will likely view a wide range of targets indirectly and directly associated with elections as viable targets for violence with the intent of instilling fear among voters, candidates, and election workers, as well as disrupting election processes leading up to and after the November election. Foreign malign influence actors almost certainly will target democratic processes across federal, state, and local governments, aiming to affect US voter preferences, exacerbate social tensions, and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions and processes, including election operations. Separately, foreign state-affiliated cyber actors and cyber criminals almost certainly view network infrastructure that supports US elections as attractive targets. There is no reporting, however, to suggest that foreign adversary targeting of such systems has ever prevented an eligible voter from casting a ballot, compromised the integrity of any ballots cast, or disrupted the ability to tabulate votes or transmit election results in a timely manner.

- We expect DVEs will pose the most significant physical threat to government officials, voters, and elections-related personnel and infrastructure, including polling places, ballot drop box locations, voter registration sites, campaign events, political party offices, and vote counting sites. In particular, anti-government or anti-authority DVEs, many of whom likely will be inspired by partisan policy grievances or conspiracy theories, will pose the most significant threat. We have also recently observed a rise in disruptive tactics targeting election officials and offices—like those observed in past election cycles—including hoax bomb threats, swatting, doxxing, and mailing white powder letters, intended to instill fear and disrupt campaign and election operations. We remain concerned that the use of these tactics will increase particularly as we approach Election Day, with the intent of disrupting voting and ballot counting processes. Some DVEs could also react violently should their preferred candidate lose, or they could seek to exploit possible civil unrest if there are perceptions of election fraud.
- Online users in forums frequented by some DVEs have increasingly called for violence linked to the 2024 election cycle and seek to promote violence in response to politically and socially divisive topics, like immigration, abortion rights, and LGBTQIA+ issues or significant current events. We expect DVEs will continue to rely on these issues to justify violence and promote their causes into the coming year.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security

- As the election approaches, we expect foreign malign influence actors to increase their overt and covert use of media outlets, networks of inauthentic social media accounts, and agents of influence to launder and spread their preferred narratives and further their election-related goals. We are beginning to see Russia target specific voter demographics, promote divisive narratives, and denigrate specific politicians. Russia seeks to shape electoral outcomes, undermine electoral integrity, and amplify domestic divisions, while using a variety of approaches to bolster its messaging and lend an air of authenticity to its efforts. Iran, meanwhile, perceives this year’s elections as particularly consequential for its own national security interests, and we have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting presidential campaigns. Iran, the PRC, and Russia have also increasingly used generative AI to create more believable text, inauthentic synthetic audio, and video that may enhance their ability to reach US audiences while hiding their origins.[^17]
- US election infrastructure—including voter registration databases and associated information technology (IT) infrastructure and systems—may be targeted by a broad swath of opportunistic malicious cyber actors. These critical elections components and systems typically hold sensitive personally identifiable information of US persons, much of which may also be publicly or commercially available, that could be used to facilitate follow-on foreign malign influence campaigns or other illicit activity. Financially motivated cyber criminals may penetrate and steal information from these systems to sell online or use the information obtained for other illicit or criminal purposes like fraud, scams, or additional cyber operations. Malicious cyber actors are also likely to employ election-themed spear-phishing—targeted phishing—and smishing—phishing using text messages—against individuals like election workers, political party and campaign staff and volunteers, and state and local government employees to gain access to networks of interest, including election-related targets, to collect intelligence or other sensitive information.[^18] The Intelligence Community is confident that Iranian actors have—through social engineering and other efforts—sought access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns of both political parties. Such activity, including thefts and disclosures of information, are intended to influence the US election process. Iran and Russia have used these tactics not only in the United States during this and prior federal election cycles, but also in other countries around the world.

# BORDER AND IMMIGRATION SECURITY

13
U.S. Department of Homeland Security

Overview: Within this section, we examine the threats posed by TCOs, terrorists, and other threat actors seeking to exploit our borders and migration system. The complex irregular migration trends complicate our ability to identify and thwart these threats.

The challenging border and immigration security trends we have faced over the last several years are likely to continue. Encounters with migrants have declined from monthly record highs in December 2023, with US-Mexico border encounters in July reaching the lowest monthly encounters in over three years. Still, the factors that have driven the surge in migration numbers, including persistently poor economic, social, and political conditions in migrants’ home countries and the relative strength of the US economy, remain in place. As part of this flow of migrants, we are also encountering individuals in the Terrorist Screening Data Set, known as the “terrorist watchlist.” Individuals on this list are associated with information indicating they may be directly engaged in or supporting terrorist activities as well as known associates of watchlisted individuals. Inclusion on the list triggers increased scrutiny when such an individual is encountered during the immigration process. TCOs similarly exploit this complex environment to smuggle deadly drugs across our borders, often through ports of entry, and to extort and mislead migrants seeking to enter the United States. We expect TCOs will continue to evolve their tactics, use new technologies, and work to corrupt and undermine our partner nations’ security forces and rule of law.

## Migration and Watchlist Encounter Trends

14
Homeland Threat Assessment 2025

While FY 2024 year-to-date overall migrant encounters at the US-Mexico border remain high compared to pre-pandemic historical trends, monthly encounters have declined since December 2023 and, as of July, were the lowest in over three years.[^19] This trend is probably explained, in part, by increased Mexican enforcement efforts and migrant reactions to shifts in US asylum policy. As in FY 2023, migrants continue to come from a broader set of countries than in years past, often leveraging other countries’ lax visa policies to enter the Western Hemisphere en route to the United States. Migration often results from a complex mix of factors, including persistently poor economic, social, and political conditions in migrants’ home countries and the relative strength of the US economy. Factors that could impact and cause fluctuations in migrant encounters over the next year include real or perceived changes in US or regional immigration policy, as well as unforeseen events that change conditions in home, host, and transit countries.

- Encounters at the US-Mexico border peaked in December 2023—probably due, in part, to a brief pause in Mexican enforcement measures—before declining throughout 2024 after Mexico restored and heightened these enforcement measures. Following US policy changes in June 2024, which restricted asylum eligibility and increased the consequences for crossing the border without authorization, public posts online suggested that prospective migrants perceived an increased risk of repatriation, which probably drove further decreases in migrant encounters and spurred more migrants to seek lawful pathways to enter the United States. Encounters with migrants from Eastern Hemisphere countries—such as China, India, Russia, and western African countries—in FY 2024 have decreased slightly from about 10 to 9 percent of overall encounters, but remain a higher proportion of encounters than before FY 2023.
- Over the next year, we expect migrant reactions to real or perceived changes in both US and regional immigration policies to influence some potential migrants’ decisions to attempt irregular entry into the United States. In July, some US-bound migrants told news media that they hoped to reach the US-Mexico border before the 2024 election, perceiving that a change in administration might result in border closures and the end of CBP One appointments. Misinformation—sometimes peddled by human smugglers—about changes in immigration policy can prompt sudden influxes of migrants to the border with little warning.
- While the US-Mexico border remains the primary destination for irregular migration, migrant encounters along the US-Canada border continue to increase, with over 181,000 migrant encounters in FY 2024 through August, compared to about 170,000 encounters at the same time in FY 2023. US Coast Guard maritime migrant interdictions have dropped significantly, with only 3,132 migrants interdicted in FY 2024 through August compared to 12,128 in the same timeframe in FY 2023.
