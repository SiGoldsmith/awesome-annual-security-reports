## Introduction

In 2024, we witnessed a surge in sophisticated cyber threats. Driven by global
digitization, the number of ransomware attacks and breaches continued to
grow across multiple industries. Threat actors more frequently exploited
zero-day vulnerabilities, targeting both public and private sectors, and
leveraged AI to automate reconnaissance, vulnerability exploitation, data
exfiltration, and malware generation.

Additionally, Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) has continued to evolve, with
a marked rise in AI-generated phishing campaigns that bypassed traditional
security measures. In response, organizations adopted more proactive
defense mechanisms, including deep learning–based threat detection
and real-time anomaly detection.

Key events shaping the threat landscape included the global surge in supply
chain attacks and several massive, high-profile breaches, exposing millions of
users’ sensitive data. In particular, the healthcare and financial sectors faced
unprecedented challenges during 2024, with ransomware groups using
advanced and constantly evolving malware that adapted in real time to
evade signature-based defenses. Additionally, several zero-day vulnerabilities
in widely used enterprise software were exploited, underscoring the need
for timely patch management and threat intelligence sharing.

Collaborations between cybersecurity firms and government agencies led
to the successful takedown of a major ransomware network in late 2024,
highlighting the power of global cooperation in cybersecurity. Despite these
notable successes, cyberattacks still rose during the final months of 2024,
as they do at the end of each year.

The trends observed this year emphasize the need for a paradigm shift in data security strategies.
Organizations must adopt a layered strategy that features preemptive
cybersecurity capabilities, combining deep learning models for predictive
threat analysis and prevention to effectively fight back against Dark AI.
Proactive threat hunting powered by AI-driven insights and continuously
improving threat intelligence platforms is crucial in mitigating future threats.
As adversaries refine their tactics, the focus must shift to proactive prevention
and zero-day data security frameworks to safeguard sensitive data.

## The Top Malware Trends of 2024

As cyber threats continued to evolve, 2024 experienced a surge in malware activity,
with ransomware remaining a dominant force. While the overall number of
attacks has increased, the rate of growth slowed compared to previous years,
reflecting both the persistence of cybercriminal tactics and the growing
sophistication of organizational defenses.

## Ransomware Trends

Reports show a 30% increase in overall global cyberattacks
in Q2 2024 compared to the same period in 2023[^1]

![Image description: Ransomware attacks 2024 graph]

The total number of ransomware attacks in 2024 was higher than in previous
years, but the growth rate slowed, especially compared to the dramatic
growth between 2022 and 2023.

Between 2022 and 2023, ransomware incidents skyrocketed due to a
confluence of factors, including increased digitization, more sophisticated
attack tools, and more widespread targeting of critical infrastructure.
Global ransomware payouts also increased significantly.

Reports show a 30% increase in overall global cyberattacks in Q2-24
compared to Q2-23.

While ransomware attacks remain a key driver of these incidents, RaaS and
the emergence of AI-enhanced tactics have also contributed to the rise.

### Ransomware Surge

![Image description: Quarterly ransomware victims discovered over the last 3 years.]

Industry data reveals a steady increase in
ransomware victims from 2022 to 2024, with 2024
showing the highest numbers in Q1, Q2, and Q3,
underscoring the growing severity of the threat.
The number of victims in Q2 and Q3 of 2024 was
more than double the 2022 numbers during those
same quarters.

Notably, across all three years, the highest victim
counts were consistently in Q4, indicating a surge
in attacks toward the end of the year.

This year-over-year growth highlights ransomware
campaigns’ expanding reach and sophistication,
likely driven by advanced tools, broader targeting
methods, and gaps in defenses preventing
unknown threats.

## Global Ransomware Impact: The Most-Targeted Countries in 2024

![Image description: Targeted countries by ransomware frequency map]

Ransomware attacks have
targeted countries
worldwide, but some are
hit harder than others.

While the United States is targeted more by
ransomware than any other country in the world,
France is the most affected, with upwards of 74% of
organizations reporting ransomware incidents in
2024. South Africa, Italy, and Austria were also
heavily affected, with 69% of organizations in each
country reporting ransomware incidents.

**Top Targets by % of Organizations**

- France: 74%
- South Africa, Italy, and Austria: 69%
- United States: Most frequent target of ransomware attacks

## Top Sectors Targeted by Ransomware in 2024

The most expensive ransomware
attacks of 2024 predominantly targeted
the healthcare sector, highlighting its
vulnerability to such threats.

- **India’s Regional Cancer Center (RCC):** A ransom demand of $100 million.
- **Synnovis (UK Pathology Services):** A ransom demand of $50 million.
- **Change Healthcare (United States):** A ransom demand of $22 million was paid, underscoring the financial impact on healthcare technology providers.
- **Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital:** A ransom demand of $3.4 million was not paid, highlighting ongoing resistance efforts within the sector.

![Image description: Ransomware targets by sector pie chart]

These examples illustrate how ransomware groups prioritize sectors that
manage critical services and sensitive data, leveraging operational urgency
to pressure victims into paying, showcasing the sector’s susceptibility
to high-stakes attacks and underscoring the risks to critical
healthcare operations.

While other sectors such as technology (e.g., CDK Global – $25 million
ransom) also experienced significant attacks, healthcare stood out due
to the number of high-profile cases and the operational impact.

Attackers target healthcare for its critical services and often limited
cybersecurity measures. They know disruptions can have life-threatening
consequences, encouraging prompt ransom payments to restore
operations quickly.

## Ransomware Threat Actors

The majority of prominent ransomware groups in 2024 operated under a RaaS model, allowing them to
scale operations by recruiting affiliates who conduct attacks using the group’s infrastructure and tools in
exchange for a percentage of ransom payments. This business model has proven highly effective,
with groups like LockBit offering up to 80% of ransom proceeds to affiliates, helping explain the
continued proliferation of ransomware attacks despite increased law enforcement pressure.

![Image description: Top ransomware threat actors of 2024 bar chart]
![Image description: Top ransomware threat actors of 2024 with comparison to their all-time activity bar chart]

### Top Ransomware Groups in 2024

#### Lockbit 3.0

**RANSOMWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (RAAS) MODEL**

LockBit is a sophisticated ransomware group known for its highly
targeted attacks on businesses, critical infrastructure, and government
entities worldwide.

Operating under a RaaS model, LockBit provides malicious affiliates with
tools and infrastructure to compromise victims, encrypt their data,
and demand substantial ransoms.

Their tactics frequently include double extortion— first encrypting critical
files and then threatening to leak sensitive information if payment isn’t made.
This creates substantial pressure for organizations to comply.

LockBit has been active since at least 2019. It has refined its malware over
time, improving evasion techniques, and continuously adapting to security
measures, making it one of the more persistent and formidable ransomware
threats in the cyber landscape.

In response, international cybersecurity disclosures have provided
technical details, indicators of compromise, and defensive measures to
help organizations detect and prevent LockBit infections. In parallel,
governments and regulatory bodies imposed sanctions on individuals and
entities linked to LockBit, aiming to freeze assets, disrupt financial operations,
and deter future attacks. Combined with law enforcement actions and
cross-border cooperation, these measures seek to weaken LockBit’s
influence and reduce the profitability of the ransomware ecosystem.

LockBit’s influence stems from its affiliate program, which operates
as a RaaS model, providing cybercriminals with access to its ransomware
toolkit and infrastructure in exchange for a modest share of the proceeds.
Notably, LockBit only takes 20% of the ransom payments, allowing affiliates
to keep the remaining 80%, making it one of the most attractive profit-sharing

models in the cybercrime ecosystem. This profit-sharing model, meshed with
user-friendly tools and robust technical support, has contributed to LockBit’s
widespread appeal among cybercriminals.

![Image description: Affiliate rules from LockBit RaaS Website]

#### RansomHub

**RANSOMWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (RAAS) MODEL**

RansomHub is a relatively new, rapidly evolving ransomware group that
appears to have emerged as an updated iteration of the older Knight
ransomware operation.

RansomHub is one of three new entrants this year—
alongside Dispossessor and KillSec—that have placed
among the top 20 ransomware operators in 2024.

They have garnered attention for their use of sophisticated attack techniques,
including leveraging the Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) to gain an
initial foothold in targeted environments. A key differentiator in RansomHub’s
approach is the introduction of a unique affiliate prepayment model, requiring
would-be partners to pay upfront for access to their ransomware strains,
command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, and negotiation portals.
This approach, combined with their marketing efforts in cybercriminal forums,
has attracted former affiliates from established groups like ALPHV (BlackCat),
effectively broadening RansomHub’s network and increasing their
operational capacity.

As a RaaS provider, RansomHub assists affiliates in conducting “double
extortion” attacks—first encrypting victims’ files and then threatening to leak
stolen data if the ransom demand isn’t paid. This pressure tactic, coupled with
the group’s ongoing efforts to refine its tools, distribution methods—and
negotiation strategies—makes RansomHub an emerging and concerning
player in the ransomware ecosystem. Victims range from small businesses to
larger organizations in various sectors.

#### Dispossessor

**RANSOMWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (RAAS) MODEL**

The formerly globally active criminal ransomware group
Radar/Dispossessor, which targeted dozens of companies in various
industries, including healthcare and transportation, was taken down
in early 2025 following an FBI investigation.

Dispossessor appeared to follow a RaaS model, similar to LockBit.
This approach allows RaaS groups to distribute ransomware through
affiliates, who then execute attacks on various targets. The decentralized
nature of this model makes it challenging for law enforcement to
completely dismantle their operations.

Dispossessor does not appear to have actually possessed ransomware
capabilities; instead, it functioned more as a data broker. Since no
instances of their ransomware have been observed, it is clear that they
were primarily publishing data leaks from other groups, including those
that are now defunct or have been shut down. This makes them
“opportunistic” rather than “direct” threat actors.

The group, founded in August 2023 and led by the online moniker “Brain,”
targeted small- to medium-size companies, first focusing on the US
before expanding globally.

#### Play

**RANSOMWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (RAAS) MODEL**

The Play Ransomware group, often simply referred to as “Play,” is a
financially motivated threat cluster that has monetized access via
PLAYCRYPT (aka “Play”) ransomware. Play has been active since at
least March 2023, with suspected activity dating to September 2022.

Known for leveraging vulnerabilities and employing stealthy infiltration
methods, the group quickly encrypts victims’ data and appends a
distinctive “.play” extension to compromised files. Victims are
pressured into paying large ransoms not only for file decryption keys
but also to prevent the public release of sensitive stolen information.
This double-extortion tactic increases the urgency to comply. With a
range of targets and shifting tactics, Play Ransomware exemplifies the
fluid, evolving threat landscape that modern enterprises face.

#### Akira

**RANSOMWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (RAAS) MODEL**

Akira is a RaaS group that has been especially active throughout 2024.
Last year, Akira compromised over 250 organizations across North America,
Europe, and Australia, amassing more than $42 million in ransom payments
early in 2024.

Initially, Akira targeted Windows systems, but in April 2023, the group
expanded its operations by deploying a Linux variant aimed at VMware ESXi
virtual machines. In August 2023, they introduced “Megazord,” a Rust-based
encryptor that appends the .powerranges extension to encrypted files while
continuing to use their original C++-based ransomware with the .akira
extension. Both variants have been used interchangeably in their attacks.

#### Hunters

**RANSOMWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (RAAS) MODEL**

Hunters International is a RaaS group that emerged in late 2023,
coinciding with international law enforcement’s disruption of the
Hive ransomware group.

Despite their recent inception, they have quickly risen to prominence,
claiming responsibility for at least 134 attacks in the first seven months
of 2024, making them the 10th-most active ransomware group during
this period.

One of the notable tools in their arsenal is SharpRhino, a custom Remote
Access Trojan (RAT) written in C#. SharpRhino is distributed through
typosquatting domains, impersonating legitimate tools like IP Scanners
and aiming to deceive IT professionals into downloading the malware.

Despite the claims, Hunters International denies being a rebrand of the
defunct Hive group. It states that it is an independent entity that acquired
Hive’s source code and infrastructure.

#### Medusa

**RANSOMWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (RAAS) MODEL**

Medusa is also a RaaS group that has significantly intensified its operations
throughout 2024. Unlike many ransomware operators, Medusa maintains a
presence on both the dark web and the public web, publicizing its activity
on platforms like X and Telegram.

Once inside a network, Medusa employs sophisticated tactics to
maintain persistence and evade detection. They utilize compromised
Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools, such as ConnectWise
and AnyDesk, which are often trusted within organizational environments,
allowing them to operate without raising immediate suspicion.

Medusa’s ransom demands have been substantial, with the average ransom
in 2024 reported to be approximately $668,000. The group employs
a double-extortion strategy, not only encrypting victims’ data, but also
exfiltrating sensitive information and threatening to publish it if the
ransom is not paid.

#### Qilin

**RANSOMWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (RAAS) MODEL**

Qilin, also known as Agenda, is a suspected Russian-speaking ransomware
group that focuses on high-value targets and demands steep ransom prices.
Qilin operates as a RaaS and employs double-extortion tactics.

The first instances of Qilin, originally developed in the Go language, surfaced
around August 2022. In December of that year the malware was rewritten in
Rust. It usually infiltrates the system via phishing and exploits exposed
applications like Citrix and RDP.

Security researchers found code similarities with the Black Basta,
Black Matter, and REvil ransomware families, implying a possible link.

The group is also known for being politically motivated: Following attacks on
hospitals in the UK, it stated the attacks were executed to protest the British
government’s involvement in an unspecified war (presumably Russia–Ukraine).

#### BianLian

**DOUBLE-EXTORTION RANSOMWARE GROUP**

The BianLian Group targets public-facing applications on Windows and
ESXi infrastructure. It gains access to victims’ systems primarily through
valid Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials. Once inside, they use a
combination of open-source tools and command-line scripts to perform
system discovery, harvest credentials, and exfiltrate sensitive data. Data is
typically exfiltrated via protocols like File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Rclone,
or Mega. Before exfiltration, the group often runs PowerShell scripts to
compress or encrypt the collected data.

BianLian actors have exploited CVE-2022-37969, a vulnerability impacting
Windows 10 and 11 systems, to escalate their privileges. They use external
proxies like Rsocks to establish SOCKS5 network tunnels, masking the
destination of their C2 traffic.

The group initially operated under a double-extortion model, encrypting
systems after data exfiltration. However, starting in January 2023, they shifted
primarily to an exfiltration-based extortion approach and moved to exclusively
extorting victims through data theft around January 2024. They typically
threaten to release stolen data unless the victim pays a ransom.

BianLian’s ransomware is written in Go and includes several anti-analysis
techniques. For example, they rename binaries and create scheduled
tasks that mimic legitimate Windows services or security products.
Additionally, they often pack executables using UPX to conceal their
code and evade heuristic detection.

For persistence and lateral movement, the group created domain admin
accounts, compromised Azure AD accounts, and used them to move across
networks. They have also installed web shells on compromised Exchange
servers to maintain access.

#### Black Basta

**DOUBLE-EXTORTION RANSOMWARE GROUP**

Black Basta has impacted over 500 organizations across multiple
industries—including critical infrastructure—in North America, Europe,
and Australia. The group typically gains initial access through phishing and
exploiting known vulnerabilities, then employs a double-extortion tactic,
encrypting systems and exfiltrating data. Ransom notes generally don’t
include a payment demand but provide a unique code and a .onion URL
for victims to contact the group via Tor. Victims are given 10–12 days to pay
before their stolen data is published on the Black Basta site, Basta News.

> Victims are given 10–12 days to pay before their
> stolen data is published on the Black Basta site,
> Basta News.

In May 2024, Black Basta affiliates launched a social engineering campaign
targeting users with spam emails from legitimate sources, such as
subscriptions and website registrations. They followed up with phone
calls, posing as technical support, and persuaded victims to download
remote access tools such as AnyDesk or Microsoft Quick Assist.

By October 2024, this campaign expanded to include Microsoft Teams.
Attackers used legitimate Teams accounts to message victims, once again
posing as technical support and urging them to install remote access tools.
The goal remained consistent: to gain unauthorized access to victim’s systems.

#### BlackSuit

**DOUBLE-EXTORTION RANSOMWARE GROUP**

BlackSuit is a high-profile double-extortion
ransomware group that emerged in early
April 2023 and is known for attacking healthcare
and educational sectors, along with various
other industries.

It shares many code similarities with the
Royal ransomware, which is itself an offshoot
of the infamous Conti ransomware used by
WizardSpider, an advanced, financially motivated
Russian cybercrime group responsible for
countless attacks since 2016.

BlackSuit uses advanced encryption and stealth
techniques that evade most security tools by
implanting shellcodes in legitimate software.
An example can be found in our blog.

They also operate a dark web leak site where
they publish stolen data from their victims to
add extortion pressure to pay the ransom.

#### 8base

**DOUBLE-EXTORTION RANSOMWARE GROUP**

8Base’s malware gains access to target systems
primarily through phishing emails. Once infected,
it acts as double-extortion ransomware,
encrypting and stealing data. It enumerates
connected drives, identifies data files, and
encrypts them with AES-256 in CBC mode,
appending the .8base extension to the files.
The group then threatens to expose the
stolen data if the victim refuses to pay.

They use their leak site to release confidential
information in an attempt to damage the victim’s
reputation and brand.

Most of 8Base’s targets are in the professional
services industry, including accounting, legal
services, and business service providers.
However, companies in retail, manufacturing,
construction, finance, insurance, and healthcare
have also been affected.

8Base has drawn attention for its similarities
to the RansomHouse ransomware group,
particularly regarding its ransom notes and
content on its leak sites.

## Top Banking Trojans/Stealers/Spyware

Banking Trojans, stealers, and spyware remained persistent threats throughout
2024, with threat actors continuously evolving their tactics to bypass security
measures and steal sensitive financial data. These malware families primarily
focused on credential theft, banking information extraction, and cryptocurrency
wallet targeting, with some variants incorporating advanced evasion techniques
and modular architectures to enhance their effectiveness.

- **Pony (35.7%):** Pony Stealer is a dangerous password-stealing malware that can decrypt or unlock passwords for various applications, including VPNs, FTP, email, instant messaging, and web browsers. The malware collects information about the system and users, steals credentials, and can download additional malware or send stolen data to a C2 server. Since 2011, Pony Stealer has been primarily used by criminal groups aiming to steal data and money. It continues to target users in Europe and America, leveraging its ability to steal credentials, persist on infected devices, and serve as a bot for further attacks.
- **Grandoreiro (35.7%):** Grandoreiro is a banking Trojan that spreads via phishing emails. It often uses malicious attachments or links to fake websites to impersonate legitimate organizations like banks. Operated as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS), it has evolved significantly. Updates include improved decryption and domain-generation algorithms, as well as the ability to use Microsoft Outlook on infected machines to send further phishing emails. In 2024, Grandoreiro targeted 1,800 banks and crypto wallets across about 50 countries, accounting for about 5% of banking trojan attacks. The malware has improved its evasion tactics, mimicking real user behavior by recording and replaying mouse movements to bypass machine learning–based security systems. It also introduced a CAPTCHA mechanism before executing its main payload to avoid detection by sandbox analysis tools.
- **Berbew (20.6%):** Berbew is a Trojan designed to steal user passwords, with a particular focus on banking and financial institutions. It operates as both an infostealer, capturing and transmitting stored passwords to a remote server, and as a proxy, enabling attackers to use the compromised system for C2 functions or to deliver additional malware. The Trojan spreads through users opening suspicious email attachments, running downloaded programs, or utilizing peer-to-peer file sharing. A notable feature of Berbew is its use of COM hijacking. This technique ensures persistence and allows the malware to escalate privileges on the infected system, giving attackers ongoing access.
- **Cryxos (8%):** Cryxos is Trojan Scareware malware. It displays alarming notifications in an attempt to fool users into calling tech support scam centers. It uses JavaScript to display messages inside legitimate websites to add a layer of credibility and compel action. This happens after it is deployed by a dropper, another malware responsible for the initial infection.

## Other Notable Malware

- **Expiro:** Expiro is a family of file-infecting malware that embeds itself into legitimate executables. It often enables the theft of sensitive data and grants unauthorized access to infected systems.
- **IFramer:** iFramer is malware that silently injects hidden iframes into compromised websites, redirecting unsuspecting visitors to harmful content or exploit kits.
- **Cobalt Strike Beacon:** Cobalt Strike is a commercial red-team penetration testing tool that is frequently misused by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access, deliver malicious payloads, and coordinate sophisticated attacks.
- **Snojan:** Snojan is a type of Trojan malware that infiltrates systems to steal sensitive data and enable remote attackers to access compromised devices. It disguises itself within legitimate software, making detection and removal more difficult for users and security tools.
- **Cosmu:** Cosmu is a Trojan malware family that typically downloads malicious components, collects sensitive information, and provides attackers with unauthorized remote control over compromised systems.

## Top Takeaways

The cybersecurity landscape of 2024 was marked by several
significant shifts in how threat actors operate and how the global
community responds. The following key developments highlight
the evolving nature of cyber threats and the increasing
sophistication of both attacks and defensive measures.

## Ransomware Disclosures, Sanctions, and Their Impact on Criminal Groups

Governments use ransomware disclosures and sanctions to combat
cybercriminal groups.

Disclosures by agencies like the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and
international partners provide public information about ransomware tactics,
operations, and specific threat actors. These efforts often accompany
sanctions, such as freezing assets, blocking cryptocurrency transactions,
and targeting infrastructure used by ransomware groups.

Sanctions aim to disrupt these groups’ financial networks, making it harder
for them to profit from attacks. High-profile actions, like dismantling
Hive’s infrastructure and sanctions against LockBit affiliates, weaken groups’
operational capabilities and deter affiliates. However, these measures are
not foolproof; many groups adapt, rebrand, or shift operations to evade
law enforcement.

While disclosures and sanctions do not eliminate ransomware,
they reduce its effectiveness and signal increased accountability for
cybercriminal activities.

## The Impact of Sanctions and Disclosures on the LockBit Ransomware Group

**LOCKBIT 2021-2024 ACTIVITY**
![Image Description: Activity timeline with key actions and publications about the LockBit ransomware gang]

- **November 2022:** Mikhail Vasiliev, a LockBit affiliate, was charged by U.S. authorities for his involvement in LockBit ransomware operations.
- **May 2023:** The U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against Mikhail Matveev for deploying LockBit ransomware and other ransomware variants. He was tied to attacks on various entities, including the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. A $10 million reward was announced for information leading to his arrest.
- **February 2024:** In a coordinated operation across 11 countries called “Operation Cronos,” law enforcement agencies delivered a major setback to the notorious LockBit ransomware group through a joint initiative.
- **May 2024:** The U.S. Treasury, in collaboration with the U.K. and Australia, sanctioned Dmitry Khoroshev, a senior leader of LockBit. This included unsealing an indictment and revealing his role in developing and deploying LockBit ransomware.
- **September 2024:** A coordinated U.S. and U.K. law enforcement operation disrupted LockBit’s infrastructure, including U.S.-based servers used to facilitate data exfiltration. This operation was presented as a major blow to LockBit’s global operations

![Image description: Law enforcement announcement on “Operation Cronos”]

Sanctions and public disclosures about the group do make an impact.
However, typically, each time a task force targets LockBit, the group
quickly bounces back, much like a persistent game of whack-a-mole.
Since the recent sanctions and publications in the Cronos operation,
however, we have seen a steady decline in the group’s activities.
From this, we can conclude that it can be effective when a coalition
of countries works together to target ransomware groups, and not
all hope is lost in the fight against cybercrime.

## The Rise of Data Brokers as an Adaptation to Sanctions and Disclosures

As government enforcement measures, sanctions, and arrests target
ransomware groups, the criminal ecosystem adapts by employing specialized
data brokers to handle stolen data. These brokers serve as intermediaries,
facilitating the sale of sensitive information on darknet markets and reducing
the operational complexity for smaller or fragmented criminal crews.
This shift in roles and compartmentalization helps the ransomware economy
persist despite heightened pressure from international law enforcement.

As shown earlier in this report, Dispossessor, one of the top ransomware
players this year, does not appear to have ransomware capabilities.
Instead, it functions more accurately as a data broker. Since no instances
of their ransomware have been observed, it is evident that they primarily
publish data leaks from other groups, including those that are now defunct
or have been shut down. This positions them as opportunistic threat actors.

Although the group never maintained active ransomware capabilities and
primarily publicizes attacks carried out by affiliates of dismantled groups,
there are still actions that can be taken. On August 12, 2024, the FBI’s
Cleveland office announced the disruption of the group, which included the
dismantling of three U.S.-based servers, three UK-based servers, 18 German
servers, eight U.S.-based criminal domains, and one German-based criminal
domain. German authorities have identified twelve suspects from Germany,
Ukraine, Russia, Kenya, Serbia, Lithuania, and the United Arab Emirates.

## The Rise in Cyberattacks Driven by Geopolitical Events

Major geopolitical conflicts in 2024 have increasingly
moved into the cyber domain, with state and non-state
actors weaponizing digital capabilities to advance their
strategic objectives.

From the Israel–Hamas war to ongoing Russia–Ukraine and China–Taiwan
tensions, cyber operations have become a critical theater of modern warfare,
enabling everything from infrastructure disruption to information warfare.
These cyber campaigns demonstrate how digital attacks now
serve as both a precursor to and extension of physical conflict, while also
providing nations with options for achieving strategic goals without direct
military engagement.

### Israel–Hamas War

Cyberterrorism has become a key element in the conflict between Israel
and Hamas. Attacks from hackers and nation-state-backed groups, often
operating through proxies influenced by Iran and others, have sharply
increased. These cyberattacks target Israel’s critical infrastructure,
including media, energy, utilities, telecommunications, and transportation.
Following the October 7th escalation, there has been a rise in cyber
operations and threats directed at Jewish, Muslim, and Arab-American
communities and institutions as well.

Hamas’s cyber activities have been heavily supported by Iran, which has
provided funding and assistance to bolster Hamas’s online capabilities.
In addition, international hacking groups from countries such as Sudan,
Pakistan, and Russia have participated in cyberattacks against Israel.

Before the October 7, 2023, attacks, Hamas’s cyber unit, Gaza Cybergang,
gathered critical intelligence on Israeli military targets, which helped facilitate
the assault. Hamas also employed phishing campaigns to steal personal data.

Other tactics included deploying wiper malware to destroy data, breaching
databases to expose personal information, and hijacking digital billboards to
display Palestinian flags and spread false news about military victories.
These cyber efforts are designed to disrupt Israel and manipulate public
opinion through misinformation.

Israel, a global leader in cyber warfare with advanced capabilities, has faced
challenges in using these tools effectively against Hamas, as the group does
not rely heavily on the internet. Israel’s primary strategy has been to control
Gaza’s internet connectivity, as it oversees the region’s electricity and
internet infrastructure.

On October 27, 2023, Israel imposed a 34-hour telecommunications
blackout in Gaza, severely disrupting communication and medical services,
which drew criticism from international organizations. Since then,
similar internet shutdowns have occurred, leaving Gaza with only 15%
of its usual internet connectivity.

When internet access was available, pro-Israeli hacktivists targeted
Palestinian websites, including the Gaza Now news site. According to
Cloudflare, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks accounted for 60% of the traffic
to Palestinian websites, mostly targeting banks and tech companies.

### Russia–Ukraine War

In 2024, Russian operatives intensified their cyber campaigns against Ukraine and its allies, strategically aligning these efforts
with their military goals and wider geopolitical objectives. They also significantly escalated their cyberattacks on the UK and
other NATO countries, especially those providing military assistance to Ukraine, aiming to weaken global support for Ukraine.
The UK, in particular, has faced an increase in attacks and a more sophisticated cyber threat landscape, with state-backed
groups like Sandworm and APT29, as well as private groups operating with the Kremlin’s approval, focusing their attacks on
the UK. These attacks have intensified amid rising geopolitical tensions, focusing on critical infrastructure, government
agencies, defense organizations, and supply chains. Tactics have included espionage through spear-phishing, the deployment
of destructive malware, and disruptions to supply chains.

In response, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre responded to more than 430 cyber incidents in 2024, highlighting a
marked increase in both the scale and severity of these threats.

### China–Taiwan Tension

The conflict between China and Taiwan revolves around China’s claim that Taiwan is part of its territory. China is pursuing
what it claims is reunification, while Taiwan prioritizes its independence and sovereignty. As tensions rise, cyberattacks have
escalated, primarily because China is attempting to influence Taiwan and achieve its goal of annexation without resorting to
military invasion. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) considers cyber dominance essential, not just in the early
stages of a conflict, but as a continuous advantage to maintain.

Taiwan has been targeted by numerous cyberattacks from Chinese hacking groups such as Earth Lusca and RedJuliett, with a
particularly sharp increase in attacks during Taiwan’s January 2024 elections. This ongoing cyber strategy aligns with China’s
broader goal of reunification, using cyber tactics to weaken Taiwan’s defenses, influence its political landscape, and
discourage international support.

Taiwan is primarily focused on improving the defense of its systems and networks, and occasionally, Taiwanese hacking
groups launch attacks against China. One group, known as “Anonymous 64,” has targeted China, Hong Kong, and Macau,
executing attacks to disseminate anti-China messages.

## AI-Based Attacks

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have
revolutionized various industries by enabling unprecedented efficiency
and innovation. However, cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting these
capabilities to conduct more sophisticated, efficient, and scalable attacks,
representing a growing threat.

AI enables attackers to automate tasks that previously required human
expertise. For instance, AI-powered malware can dynamically adapt to evade
detection by learning from the behavior of security tools. Attackers are also
leveraging AI to identify vulnerabilities in networks and systems, reducing the
time required for reconnaissance. Phishing campaigns have also benefited
from the use of AI, becoming more convincing and personalized as AI models
analyze social media and other public data to
