Cybersecurity Forecast 2025 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Introduction

When looking at the year ahead, we never make predictions. 
Instead, we look at the trends we are already seeing, and provide 
realistic forecasts of what we expect to see in the wide world 
of cybersecurity.

The Cybersecurity Forecast 2025 report is filled with forward\-
looking insights from Google Cloud security leaders, including 
Sunil Potti, VP/GM, Google Cloud Security, Sandra Joyce, VP of 
Google Threat Intelligence at Google Cloud, Charles Carmakal, 
Mandiant CTO, Google Cloud, and Phil Venables, VP, TI Security \& 
CISO, Google Cloud.

The report also features insights from more than a dozen 
researchers, analysts, responders and experts across 
numerous Google Cloud security teams, including Google 
Threat Intelligence, Mandiant Consulting, Google Security 
Operations, Google Cloud’s Office of the CISO, and VirusTotal. 
These individuals are regularly on the frontlines, and know what 
organizations and security teams should be prioritizing next year.

Technology advances, threats evolve, the cybersecurity 
landscape changes, and defenders must adapt to it all if they 
want to keep up. The Google Cloud Cybersecurity Forecast 2025 
report aims to help the cybersecurity industry frame its fight 
against cyber adversaries in 2025\.

SPECIAL REPORT: MANDIANT M\-TRENDS 2023EMBARGOArtificial
 Intelligence

“2025 is the first year 
where we’ll genuinely see 
the second phase of AI in 
action with security.”

Sunil Potti. VP/GM, 
Google Cloud Security

Attacker Use of AI

Next year we anticipate malicious actors will continue their rapid adoption of 
AI\-based tools to augment and assist their online operations across various 
phases of the attack lifecycle. We will see continued use of AI and large 
language models (LLMs) to develop and scale more convincing phishing, 
vishing, SMS, and other social engineering attacks. We expect to see cyber 
espionage and cyber crime actors continue to leverage deepfakes for 
identity theft, fraud, and bypassing know\-your\-customer (KYC) security 
requirements. We expect to observe more evidence of malicious actors 
experimenting with LLMs and deepfake applications for other use cases, 
including vulnerability research, code development, and reconnaissance. 
Additionally, we anticipate more demand in underground forums for LLMs 
that lack security guardrails, allowing threat actors to query for illicit topics 
without limit. As AI capabilities become more widely available throughout 
2025, enterprises will increasingly struggle to defend themselves against 
these more frequent and effective compromises.

AI for IO

Information Operations (IO) threat actors will increasingly leverage gen AI 
tools to support their efforts. Deployment of AI capabilities has expanded 
beyond early use of generative adversarial network (GAN)\-created profiles 
to backstop inauthentic personas, and has shifted to include the use of large 
language models (LLMs) to support content creation, and the manufacturing 
of seemingly genuine articles published to inauthentic websites. This 
is a significant force multiplier that increases the scale at which actors 
engaged in this space can produce content, and create additional layers of 
obfuscation. We expect this trend to continue; actors likely using increasingly 
available gen AI tooling for a variety of ends, including scaling content 
creation, producing more persuasive content, and backstopping 
inauthentic personas.

Next Phase of AI and Security

In 2025, we expect to see a second phase of AI and 
security in action. This past year, practitioners have 
been using AI to democratize security, meaning 
they’ve begun using AI\-driven tools to automate 
the summarization of complex reports, querying 
vast datasets with ease, and obtaining real\-
time assistance for a multitude of tasks, thereby 
augmenting their capabilities and streamlining 
workflows. Reducing the toil on defenders 
performing repetitive tasks by integrating AI 
into processes and procedures is allowing 
investigations to run more efficiently, and 
security decision\-makers see AI as a key tool 
in combatting threats. Before AI helps us get 

closer to fully autonomous security operations, 
2025 will usher in an intermediate stage of semi\-
autonomous security operations. This will require 
enough capabilities in our security workflows that 
are being done by the system itself, smartly, but 
there still needs to be a human being who can 
now accomplish much more with AI support. This 

includes being able to parse through 
alerts—even with false positives—to 
create a list of the highest priority 

items, enabling security teams to further triage and 
remediate the risks that matter most.

Cybersecurity Forecast 2025 The 
 Big Four

“Geopolitical conflicts 
will continue driving cyber 
activity around the world, 
creating more complexity.”

Sandra Joyce. 
VP of Google 
Threat Intelligence 
at Google Cloud

Russia

In 2025, the Ukraine conflict will likely remain a primary focus of Russian 
cyber espionage, cyber attack, and information operations efforts. In 2024, 
we tracked increased targeting of Ukrainian soldiers’ mobile devices, with 
operators likely seeking tactical insight to support kinetic operations and 
other conventional military activities. While less frequent than in 2022 
and 2023, we continued to observe disruptive attacks, including a range 
of different critical infrastructure operators, as well as use of hacktivist 
personas such as CyberArmyofRussia\_Reborn to publicize threat activity. We 
expect these types of operations to continue into next year. 

Outside of Ukraine, Russian cyber espionage will almost certainly continue to 
support Moscow’s global interests, targeting governments, politicians, civil 
society, journalists, media outlets, and technology organizations primarily 
in Europe and NATO member countries. Pro\-Russian information operations 
will continue to use a variety of tactics to promote Russian interests and 
undermine perceived opponents, and capitalize on high\-profile events as we 
observed during the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.

China

We anticipate that institutional investments China has made in equipping 
its cyber threat operators over the last decade will continue to fuel the 
volume of threat activity and capability development trends into 2025\. We 
will continue to observe Pro\-People’s Republic of China (PRC) actors using 
stealthy tactics, including operational relay box (ORB) networks to obscure 
operator traffic to and from target environments, targeting of network edge 
devices to take advantage of vulnerable Internet\-exposed attack surface 
and reduce their footprint in target environments, and exploitation of zero\-
day vulnerabilities as a byproduct of industrializing collection of software 
vulnerabilities at a national scale. Additionally, we expect Chinese state\-
sponsored actors to continue to be aggressive, and demonstrate a high 
risk tolerance. 

Cybersecurity Forecast 2025 

6

Pro\-PRC information operations (IO) are expected 
to directly target elections and voters in countries 
and regions viewed as top strategic priorities for the 
PRC, most notably Taiwan and the U.S. This activity 
is expected to include impersonation of voters, 
promotion of disinformation about rigged votes, 
and video content featuring AI\-generated news 
hosts. Pro\-PRC IO have been largely ineffective 
at generating authentic engagement, except for 
isolated successes. However, narratives and tactics 
will remain aggressive, including use 
of ad hominem attacks and intimidation.

Iran

So long as it remains active, the Israel\-Hamas 
conflict will likely continue to dominate Iranian 
state sponsored cyber threat activity, fueling 
cyber espionage, disruptive and destructive 
attacks, and information operations. However, this 
focus will not prevent Iranian threat actors from 
continuing operations consistent with long\-term 
patterns, including targeting government and 
telecommunications organizations across the Middle 
East and North Africa, or dabbling in cyber crime. 
We are confident that longstanding objectives 
of regime stability, economic development, and 
regional influence will continue to drive monitoring of 
dissidents, key individuals and organizations linked 
to Iranian or regional politics, and technologies that 
could support Iran’s military capabilities.

North Korea

We expect geopolitics and economic need will 
drive North Korean cyber operations into 2025 
and beyond.

North Korean cyber espionage operations will 
continue to support the country’s geopolitical 
objectives, including targeting government, 
defense, education, think tank targets primarily in 
South Korea, and the U.S., with some interest in the 
UK, Germany, Australia, China, and Russia. North 
Korean actors placed heavy emphasis on supply 
chain compromises in 2023 and 2024, usually 
using trojanized open source software packages in 
social engineering operations targeting software 
developers, and we expect these tactics to 
continue into next year. 

North Korean actors will continue to pursue revenue 
generation through IT workers and cryptocurrency 
theft. IT workers will use stolen and fabricated 
identities to apply for high paying software 
development jobs. Significantly, IT workers have 
also leveraged privileged access to their employers’ 
systems to enable malicious cyber intrusions, and 
that trend will continue into next year. 

7

Cybersecurity Forecast 2025 Global 
Forecasts

PRC Actors Will Continue to Deploy 
Custom Malware Ecosystems for 
Embedded Systems

Endpoint detection and response (EDR) platforms continue to be a vital 
component of an organization’s security architecture and enable visibility into 
endpoint activity that is critical for effective security monitoring. In order to 
evade detection, People’s Republic of China (PRC)\-nexus espionage actors 
have continually demonstrated their proclivity and adeptness in developing 
highly customized malware ecosystems for embedded systems where EDR 
solutions are not readily available, and traditional digital forensics and incident 
response can be difficult. Examples include edge devices like firewalls and 
VPN gateways, or internal network devices like switches and routers. PRC 
actors design such malware ecosystems with additional capabilities that are 
specific to the targeted platform or operating system, and take advantage of 
native functionality in the underlying operating systems. These ecosystems 
can consist of several different components that work in unison to achieve 
their desired functionality.

In 2025, PRC actors will continue to employ this strategy to deploy custom 
malware that enables them to achieve stealthy backdoor access into 
environments, such as trojanizing legitimate services to listen for attacker 
connections. They will also leverage low\-level malware like rootkits in order to 
hide evidence of their activities and hinder investigation efforts.

No End in Sight: Ransomware and 
Multifaceted Extortion

“Without question, 
multifaceted extortion and 
ransomware will continue in 
2025, likely with an increase 
outside the U.S.”

Charles Carmakal. 
Mandiant CTO, 
Google Cloud

Ransomware, data theft extortion, and multifaceted extortion are, and will 
continue to be in 2025, the most disruptive type of cyber crime globally—both 
due to the volume of incidents and the scope of potential damage for each 
event. The impact of ransomware and extortion operations will also continue 
to extend far beyond the initial victim. 2024 saw significant ransomware 
incidents in the healthcare sector that negatively impacted patient care 
at hospitals, blocked patients from refilling important prescriptions, and 
prevented doctors from running vital laboratory tests or billing insurance.

8

Cybersecurity Forecast 2025 Based on available evidence, ransomware and 
extortion operations to date in 2024 have affected 
more than 100 countries and every industry vertical. 
The number of newly identified data leak sites (DLS) 
doubling in 2024 over 2023, and the emergence 
of multiple new ransomware as a service (RaaS) 
offerings, illustrate the thriving and prolific nature of 
the ransomware and extortion threat landscape.

Post U.S. Election Activity

A variety of campaigns targeted the U.S. presidential 
election throughout 2024, and we don’t expect 
operations to immediately cease now that the 
election is over. China, Russia, and Iran will continue 
to target the U.S. government throughout the rest of 
the year and into 2025, likely taking advantage of the 
administration change to seek a decision advantage. 
We anticipate seeing continued state\-sponsored 
cyber espionage, as well as information operations 
promoting politically divisive content on social media 
and other platforms. Gen AI tools will enable these 
actors to increase the scale and effectiveness of 
these operations, so these campaigns may feel more 
prevalent now than in previous elections.

Uncovering Operations 
From Years Past

We anticipate discovering and helping remediate 
a number of intrusions in 2025 that had been 
transpiring for quite some time before. In particular, 
we expect to identify more China\-nexus intrusion 
operations and espionage campaigns that originally 
occurred in 2024, or perhaps even prior. What we 
find today is that China\-nexus espionage groups are 
so good at hiding their tracks, and staying buried 
in networks for long periods of time, that our teams 
sometimes just stumble upon them years after the 
threat actors initially broke into an organization.

The Rising Threat of 
Infostealer Malware: 
A Gateway to High\- 
Impact Data Breaches

Infostealer malware, though not a novel threat, has 
demonstrated a concerning surge in sophistication 
and effectiveness. In 2024, threat actors leveraged 
stolen credentials, obtained through widespread 
infostealer campaigns, to infiltrate a significant 
number of prominent organizations, resulting 
in various high impact intrusions. The alarming 
accessibility of credentials from these tools, even to 
low\-skilled threat actors, amplifies their potential for 
widespread impact.

We anticipate the use of stolen credentials to 
persist into 2025, with infostealers continuing 
to serve as a primary vector to obtain them, 
particularly in environments where two\-factor 
authentication remains unenforced. The absence of 
this additional security layer leaves organizations 
susceptible to data breaches of varying degrees 
of severity. Furthermore, the sophistication of 
infostealer malware has escalated in recent years, 
with advancements in anti\-evasion techniques 
and capabilities to bypass endpoint detection 
and response (EDR), rendering them even more 
formidable challenges in the cyber threat landscape.

9

Cybersecurity Forecast 2025 Democratizing of Cyber 
Capabilities Will Continue 
to Lower Barriers to 
Entry for Less\-Skilled 
and Newer Actors

In 2025, organizations will continue to be challenged 
by a landscape in which an increasing number of 
barriers to entry will be eroded for cyber criminals 
and state actors with less sophistication. As more 
tools, phishing kits, and “as\-a\-service” resources 
incorporate advanced capabilities, less skilled threat 
actors and new entrants into malicious cyber activity 
will have opportunities to carry out operations with 
greater efficiency and skill. From web skimming 
to multifactor authentication (MFA) bypass, the 
growing professionalization of such services will 
expand the number of threat actors defenders 
will have to contend with. Additionally, increasing 
experimentation by threat actors with gen AI at 
different parts of the attack lifecycle will also start 
playing a greater role in increased efficiencies on the 
adversary side of the security equation.

Rising Impact of 
Compromised Identities 
in Hybrid Environments

With today’s hybrid integration of identities that 
span on\-premises and multi\-cloud architectures, 
the overall impact of a compromised identity will 
result in elevated risks for organizations. In 2025, 
it is important that organizations align processes, 
security controls, and validation efforts to minimize 
the overall impact of a single compromised identity 
resulting in downstream consequences, and also to 
reinforce the strategy of strong authentication. 

Historically, authentication for an established 
identity was based upon a singular transaction, 
which typically consisted of password\-based, 
single\-factor authentication. Now, based on the 
distributed nature of operations, organizations 
need to transition from a singular action to one that 
includes multiple criteria for validation as part of the 
authentication transaction. The multiplier element 
should not only include the identity (user) performing 
the authentication request, but can also require 
strong phishing\-resistant multifactor authentication 
(MFA) verification of the device associated with the 
identity, shorter session lifetime (re\-validation) when 
accessing sensitive resources or applications, and 
identity risk reviews and verifications.

Following this model, organizations can not only 
enforce proper guardrails to minimize impacts, 
but increase the confidence of a successful 
authentication transaction correlating to an 
authorized and expected activity.

10

Cybersecurity Forecast 2025 Maturing Security 
Operations in the Cloud

In 2025, we expect to see more widespread adoption 
of cloud\-native security information and event 
management (SIEM) solutions. Scalability and cost\-
effectiveness will drive mass adoption, even by 
those hesitating to move away from on\-premises 
deployments. We expect SIEM to reemerge as the 
central nervous system to the security operations 
center (SOC), ingesting everything from cloud 
logs to endpoint telemetry. Security orchestration, 
automation, and response (SOAR), usually a part 
of SIEM, will likely move beyond basic playbook 
execution to handle more complex incident response. 
This includes automated malware analysis, phishing 
takedowns, and even patching of vulnerabilities 
before they’re exploited. Additionally, cloud\-specific 
risks such as identity and access management (IAM) 
misconfigurations, serverless vulnerabilities, and 
container escapes will be better tackled head\-on 
with purpose\-built tools and strategies.

Criticality Drives More 
Regulations for Cloud 
Providers

We expect that as more critical infrastructure moves 
onto hyperscale cloud services, more and more 
regulators will be directly targeting cloud providers 
around the world rather than just coming through 
customers to drive the expected levels of control and 
resilience on the cloud. In 2025, cloud providers are 
going to be dealing with more regulation, and also 
increased expectations. This is appropriate given 
the extent of their criticality, and how in general an 
increasing number of services have been moving on 
to hyperscale cloud, including Google Cloud.

More Interest in Web3 
and Crypto Heists

As Web3 and cryptocurrency organizations continue 
to grow into 2025 and beyond, we expect that 
attackers will continue targeting smart contract 
vulnerabilities and private key theft to conduct 
heists. Web3 organizations are high\-value targets for 
attackers. Since 2020, there have been hundreds of 
Web3 heists reported, which has resulted in over $12 
billion in stolen digital assets. 

We anticipate Democratic People’s Republic of 
Korea (DPRK) threat actors will continue to leverage 
social engineering tactics when targeting Web3 
organizations, as well as targeting the supply chain 
to gain an initial foothold. Web3 companies will 
need to invest in enhanced security controls and 
24x7 monitoring to help detect attacks earlier in the 
lifecycle to help prevent heists.

11

Cybersecurity Forecast 2025 Faster Exploitation and 
More Vendors Targeted

In our 2024 analysis of exploited vulnerabilities 
disclosed in 2023, the average time\-to\-exploit (TTE), 
which we define as the time between disclosure and 
exploitation of a vulnerability, was five days, down 
significantly from our previous analysis’ average of 
32 days. This pace of exploitation is expected to 
continue, if not quicken, in 2025 and beyond. This 
average continues to be driven by both n\-day and 
zero\-day usage, as both remain lucrative to threat 
actors. Even when n\-day exploitation timelines are 
observed alone, we still see faster exploitation, as 
seen by the drop from 23 n\-days first exploited after 
six months in 2021\-2022, to only two first exploited 
after six months in 2023\. 

Additionally, the number and variety of targeted 
vendors in these attacks is expected to continue 
growing in 2025 and beyond, as we have seen 
increases in the number of vendors targeted for 
exploitation almost every year since 2018\. The 
number of targeted vendors reached an all\-time high 
of 56 in 2023, over double the 25 observed in 2018\. 
We expect that the number of targeted vendors will 
continue expanding beyond historically observed 
targets, requiring more awareness around attack 
surfaces and their components.

Preparing for an Age 
of Post\-Quantum 
Cryptography

Many organizations in 2025 will be starting their 
journeys towards adopting new post\-quantum 
cryptography standards finalized by the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2024\. 
The latest guidance from NIST on quantum\-safe 
encryption/key transport and cryptographic signing 
is designed to help mitigate attacks by adversaries 
with large\-scale quantum computers. These attacks 
could potentially break encryption, and ultimately 
compromise sensitive data.

Although quantum threats likely won’t have a 
widespread impact next year, organizations in 2025 
will need to start understanding the risks posed by 
quantum computing, planning their transitions to 
quantum\-resistant solutions, inventorying where they 
are using cryptography, regularly rotating encryption 
keys, and generally staying informed of quantum 
developments using threat intelligence and 
other guidance.

12

Cybersecurity Forecast 2025 EMEA 
 Forecasts

A Pivotal Year for Compliance

NIS2, the updated Network and Information Security Directive, will 
significantly reshape cybersecurity practices across EMEA in 2025\. It 
introduces stricter security requirements, and expands its scope to 
include a wider range of sectors and organizations, including essential and 
important entities. This means more businesses will need to implement 
robust security measures, conduct risk assessments, and report incidents 
promptly. NIS2 emphasizes risk management, incident response, and 
supply chain security, forcing organizations to adopt a more proactive and 
comprehensive approach. Increased oversight and enforcement will lead to 
greater accountability for cybersecurity failures. Organizations will need to 
invest in staff training, security technologies, and incident response planning 
to comply with NIS2\. The directive promotes collaboration and information 
sharing, fostering a stronger cybersecurity ecosystem in EMEA. NIS2 aims to 
harmonize cybersecurity standards across member states, improving overall 
resilience against cyber threats. By setting a higher bar for security practices, 
NIS2 will drive significant improvements in cybersecurity posture across the 
EMEA region.

13

Cybersecurity Forecast 2025 Geopolitical Conflicts 
Drive Threat Activity

More Focus on 
Cloud Security

In 2025, cloud security will be paramount for EMEA 
enterprises. While cloud security is a global concern, 
Mandiant incident response teams have observed 
a significant increase in EMEA investigations 
stemming from misconfigurations, inadequate 
monitoring, credential reuse, and weak security 
practices within unmanaged cloud environments. 
This trend is expected to continue next year. 
Organizations in the EMEA region are experiencing 
rapid cloud adoption, and the division of 
responsibilities between business owners, DevOps, 
and SecOps teams have a tendency to exacerbate 
these issues and challenges. Organizations in the 
EMEA region will have to prioritize cloud security 
to protect sensitive data and maintain customer 
trust. They will also need to invest in robust security 
solutions, implement stricter access controls, and 
enhance monitoring capabilities.

Geopolitical conflicts will continue to be a major 
driver of 2025 threat activity in EMEA, impacting 
entities all across the region. The ongoing conflict 
in Ukraine and the persistent tensions in the Middle 
East are key factors contributing to this trend, and 
so long as they continue into next year, organizations 
and countries in the region will feel direct and 
indirect effects.

While private entities and individuals have limited 
direct influence over geopolitical challenges, 
countries that align themselves with one side or 
another in conflicts can face consequences. One 
of the ways we see this is through the targeting 
of digital services and infrastructure. Increasing 
reliance on these technologies has made them more 
attractive targets to opposition, and consequently 
more vulnerable to disruption.

There is no evidence to suggest this trend will 
decrease in 2025\. We anticipate more targeting of 
digital services by opposing patriotic forces, such as 
hacktivists or state\-sponsored campaigns that disrupt 
or compromise digital infrastructure. Therefore, 
organizations must prioritize understanding and 
staying informed about geopolitical events as they 
unfold in the cyber domain.

14

Cybersecurity Forecast 2025 JAPAC 
 Forecasts

North Korea Threat Actors Setting Their 
Sights on JAPAC

As cryptocurrency investments continue to grow in the JAPAC region, we 
expect to see increased targeting of cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly 
from North Korean threat actors. Throughout 2024, North Korea has 
continued its attacks against cryptocurrency exchanges, and in September 
2024 the FBI issued an alert on the problem. JAPAC has among the highest 
adoption and growth rates for cryptocurrencies, and this past year there 
were reports of significant cryptocurrency breaches in the region—including 
theft of tens and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of digital assets. 

One of the ways North Korea is targeting JAPAC countries is by 
impersonating remote IT workers. The U.S. Department of Justice 
and other agencies warned “of attempts by Democratic People’s Republic 
of Korea (DPRK, a.k.a. North Korea) information technology (IT) workers to 
obtain employment while posing as non\-North Korean nationals”. As part 
of these operations, some of the fake IT workers worked for organizations 
located in JAPAC countries.

15

Cybersecurity Forecast 2025 Cyber Criminals in Southeast 
Asia Continue to Innovate

In 2025, we anticipate seeing continued innovation 
by Southeast Asia cyber criminals. A new report by 
the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime found 
that Asian crime syndicates are now integrating new 
service\-based business models and technologies—
including malware, gen AI, and deepfakes—into their 
operations, while establishing new underground 
markets and cryptocurrency solutions for their 
money laundering needs. According to the report, 
organized cyber crime in the region is evolving 
rapidly, and this trend will likely lead to an escalation 
of activity in the JAPAC region. It is critical for 
governments and enterprises to formalize regular 
intelligence\-sharing to understand these tactics, 
techniques and procedures in greater detail, and to 
be able to trace it to illicit financial flows.

Chinese\-Controlled 
Websites Posing as Local 
News Outlets Target 
Global Audiences with 
Pro\-Beijing Content

In 2022, we exposed the HaiEnergy campaign, 
which consisted of a network of 72 suspected 
inauthentic news sites and a number of suspected 
inauthentic social media assets, used to 
disseminate content strategically aligned with the 
political interests of the People’s Republic of China 
(PRC). The sites published content in 11 languages. 
Since then, we have uncovered at least two other 
campaigns where third\-party companies or PR 
firms have been hired to promote government 
narratives via fictitious “Local News” outlets. 

This threat poses a heightened risk of inadvertent 
amplification by other local media outlets owing 
to a lack of due diligence or readers who chance 
upon these fake “Local News” outlets. Even though 
these campaigns have not been very effective in 
changing the global perception towards China in 
2024, we believe these campaigns will persist into 
2025, and it is crucial that we continue to uncover 
and track these fake news outlets to educate 
global readers. Therefore, organizations must 
prioritize understanding and staying informed 
about geopolitical events as they unfold in the 
cyber domain.

“2025 is going to be the 
year when AI moves from 
pilots and prototypes into 
large\-scale adoption.” 

Phil Venables. 
VP, TI Security \& CISO, 
Google Cloud

In 2025, the cybersecurity industry will continue to innovate, 
while organizations will face evolving challenges across the 
vast threat landscape. 

Rapid advancements in technology, particularly in artificial 
intelligence, are reshaping tactics for both defenders and 
adversaries. While AI is rapidly bringing new tools for threat 
detection and response, it also provides malicious actors with 
powerful capabilities for social engineering, disinformation, 
and other attacks.

We will continue to see activity from The Big Four—Russia, 
China, Iran, and North Korea—who will pursue their respective 
geopolitical goals through cyber espionage, disruption, and 
influence operations. Additionally, ransomware and multifaceted 
extortion, as well as the proliferation of infostealer malware, 
pose significant risks to organizations worldwide.

In 2025, organizations must prioritize a proactive and 
comprehensive approach to cybersecurity. This includes 
adopting cloud\-native security solutions, implementing robust 
identity and access management controls, and staying ahead 
of emerging threats through continuous monitoring and threat 
intelligence. It also means preparing for the post\-quantum 
cryptography era, and complying with evolving regulations.

The Cybersecurity Forecast 2025 report aims to equip 
organizations with the insights and knowledge they need to 
navigate this complex landscape. By understanding evolving 
trends and potential threats, organizations can strengthen their 
defenses, and build a more resilient future.
