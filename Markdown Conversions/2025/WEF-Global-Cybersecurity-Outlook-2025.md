## Foreword
Following decades of relative stability, the world today is marked by increased geopolitical conflicts. The fallout of this turbulence in the digital realm – the growing prowess of cybercriminals, rapid advances in emerging technologies and widening cyber capabilities – have led to a cyberspace that is more complex than ever before. Against this backdrop, the Global Cybersecurity Outlook serves as an indispensable tool to help leaders navigate such complexity and identify essential actions to build resilient ecosystems.

Last year’s report brought to the fore the prevailing inequity between the cyber haves and have-nots. Despite increased executive awareness of cybersecurity risks, the complexity in cyberspace is further exacerbating cyber inequity as resilient organizations pull ahead, while others struggle with limited resources. Amid increasingly interdependent supply chains, this cyber inequity is resulting in systemic points of failure with significant consequences for the overall resilience of the ecosystem.

The transformative potential of AI technologies presents both unprecedented risks and unmatched opportunities for cybersecurity. As organizations race to adopt AI, cybercriminals are moving at breakneck speed to exploit vulnerabilities while enhancing the efficacy of their methods. Cyber defenders, too, are leaving no stone unturned in harnessing the potential of these technologies to shift the balance in this growing AI arms race.

Looking to the future, the level of complexity shows no signs of abating. In a borderless cyberspace, greater collaboration between actors in the public and private sectors is crucial for safeguarding the benefits of digitalization for all. This is a call to action, and the time to act is now.

## Executive summary
While the 2024 edition of the Global Cybersecurity Outlook highlighted the growing inequity in cyberspace, this year’s report shines a light on the increasing complexity of the cyber landscape, which has profound and far-reaching implications for organizations and nations.

This complexity is driven by a series of compounding factors:

- Escalating geopolitical tensions are contributing to a more uncertain environment.
- Increased integration of and dependence on more complex supply chains is leading to a more opaque and unpredictable risk landscape.
- The rapid adoption of emerging technologies is contributing to new vulnerabilities as cybercriminals harness them effectively to achieve greater sophistication and scale.
- Simultaneously, the proliferation of regulatory requirements around the world is adding a significant compliance burden for organizations. All of these challenges are exacerbated by a widening skills gap, making it extremely challenging to manage cyber risks effectively.

In a complex cyberspace characterized by geopolitical uncertainties, widening cyber inequity and sophisticated cyberthreats, leaders must adopt a security-first mindset.

The growing complexity of cyberspace is exacerbating cyber inequity, widening the gap between large and small organizations, deepening the divide between developed and emerging economies, and expanding sectoral disparities.[^1] Some 35% of small organizations believe their cyber resilience is inadequate, a proportion that has increased sevenfold since 2022. By contrast, the share of large organizations reporting insufficient cyber resilience has nearly halved.

![Organizations reporting insufficient cyber resilience](Image description)

This disparity in cyber resilience is further highlighted by regional differences in preparedness: while only 15% of respondents in Europe and North America lack confidence in their country’s ability to respond to major cyber incidents targeting critical infrastructure, this proportion rises to 36% in Africa and 42% in Latin America.

![Regional differences in cyber resilience](Image description)

The public sector is disproportionately affected, with 38% of respondents reporting insufficient resilience, compared to just 10% of medium-to-large private-sector organizations. This inequity extends to the cyber workforce, with 49% of public-sector organizations indicating they lack the necessary talent to meet their cybersecurity goals – an increase of 33% from 2024.

The Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2025 report includes a deeper analysis of the most important drivers of complexity and provides valuable insights into the most pressing cyber challenges in the year ahead and their potential implications for executives.

Of large organizations, 54% identified supply chain challenges as the biggest barrier to achieving cyber resilience. The increasing complexity of supply chains, coupled with a lack of visibility and oversight into the security levels of suppliers, has emerged as the leading cybersecurity risk for organizations. Key concerns include software vulnerabilities introduced by third parties and propagation of cyberattacks throughout the ecosystem.

Nearly 60% of organizations state that geopolitical tensions have affected their cybersecurity strategy. Geopolitical turmoil has also affected the perception of risks, with one in three CEOs citing cyber espionage and loss of sensitive information/intellectual property (IP) theft as their top concern, while 45% of cyber leaders are concerned about disruption of operations and business processes.

![The effects of geopolitical tensions on organizations’ cybersecurity strategies](Image description)

These are the key findings from this year’s report and the main trends that executives will need to navigate in 2025:

While 66% of organizations expect AI to have the most significant impact on cybersecurity in the year to come, only 37% report having processes in place to assess the security of AI tools before deployment. This reveals the paradox of the gap between the recognition of AI-driven cybersecurity risks and the rapid implementation of AI without the necessary security safeguards to ensure cyber resilience.

Some 72% of respondents report an increase in organizational cyber risks, with ransomware remaining a top concern. Nearly 47% of organizations cite adversarial advances powered by generative AI (GenAI) as their primary concern, enabling more sophisticated and scalable attacks. In 2024 there was a sharp increase in phishing and social engineering attacks, with 42% of organizations reporting such incidents.

Regulations are increasingly seen as an important factor for improving baseline cybersecurity posture and building trust. However, their proliferation and disharmony are creating significant challenges for organizations, with more than 76% of chief information security officers (CISOs) at the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting on Cybersecurity in 2024 reporting that fragmentation of regulations across jurisdictions greatly affects their organizations’ ability to maintain compliance.

Since 2024, the cyber skills gap has increased by 8%, with two out of three organizations reporting moderate-to-critical skills gaps, including a lack of essential talent and skills to meet their security requirements. Furthermore, only 14% of organizations are confident that they have the people and skills they need today.

## 1 Understanding complexity in cyberspace
As cyberspace becomes increasingly complex, it has the potential to exacerbate cyber inequity for organizations that are unable to meet growing challenges.

Cybersecurity is entering an era of unprecedented complexity. Geopolitical tensions are intensifying, new technologies are emerging at breakneck speed and threats are evolving into ever more sophisticated attack vectors. At the same time, expanding regulatory demands, vulnerabilities in interwoven supply chains and a widening cyber skills gap are compounding the challenges organizations face in staying secure. The stakes have never been higher.

The Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024 revealed significant cyber inequity, exposing stark disparities in resilience between small and large organizations.[^2] The World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 2024 found that cyber insecurity is a global risk over multiple time horizons, with cyber risks such as malware, deepfakes and misinformation threatening supply chains, financial stability and democratic systems.[^3] Additionally, the Chief Risk Officers Outlook from October 2024 ranked cyber risk among the top three threats severely affecting organizations.[^4] A striking 71% of chief risk officers anticipated severe organizational disruptions due to cyber risks and criminal activity.[^5]

In 2024 the world witnessed the largest IT outage in history, disrupting airlines, banks, broadcasters, healthcare providers, retail payment systems and ATMs globally and causing an estimated $5 billion in losses.[^6] This incident underscored the vulnerabilities stemming from dependence on a limited number of critical providers. Cyberthreats continued to escalate, with 72% of respondents to the Global Cybersecurity Outlook (GCO) survey (see Appendix: Methodology) reporting a rise in cyber risks. The survey further revealed that cybercrime grew in both frequency and sophistication, marked by ransomware attacks, AI-enhanced tactics – such as phishing, vishing and deepfakes – and a notable increase in supply chain attacks.

### 1.1 Major disparities and disruptions
The 2025 report finds that a series of compounding factors are driving an escalating complexity in the cyber landscape:

- Geopolitical tensions are contributing to a more uncertain environment.
- Increased integration and dependence on more complex supply chains are leading to a more opaque and unpredictable risk landscape.
- The rapid adoption of emerging technologies is contributing to new vulnerabilities and new threats.

Meanwhile, the proliferation of international regulatory requirements adds an additional compliance burden for organizations. All of these challenges are compounded by a widening skills gap, further complicating the ability to manage cyber risks effectively.

Together, these factors drive increasing complexity and unpredictability in the cyber landscape, which affects organizations in many ways. First, it drives inequity throughout the cyber ecosystem, undermining resilience by creating a divide between those organizations that have the resources to adapt and those that do not and subsequently fall behind. This affects the resilience of the ecosystem, because many larger and more mature organizations typically depend on extensive networks of smaller, often less-mature suppliers, and any incident affecting them could also impact the entire supply chain. Second, it drives greater demand for more specialist skills in cybersecurity, further exacerbating the skills gap. Keeping up with technological advances requires more specific skills that are in greater demand in the cyber skills market. At the same time, complexity puts increasing pressure on often already stretched cybersecurity teams.

These challenges demand a comprehensive re-evaluation of cyber strategies at the organizational and ecosystem level to address the complexity that has become inherent in the cyber landscape.[^7] A broader understanding of cyber risk is necessary that goes beyond mere “IT” and considers cyber from an overall business risk perspective.

### 1.2 The challenge for the year ahead
> 72% of GCO survey respondents reported a rise in cyber risks.

![Factors compounding the complex nature of cybersecurity](Image description)

> Against a backdrop of growing cyberthreats and expanding attack surfaces, network defenders are drowning in the operational complexity of a legacy security mindset. They struggle to stitch together dozens of disparate security solutions and enforce security policies across an enterprise’s network, cloud and endpoint environments. As a result, people – our most precious cyber resource – are left manually triaging alerts from increasingly automated attacks. To stay ahead of adversaries, we need to reimagine cybersecurity operations, leverage the power of AI and deprive attackers of any technological advantage.

## 2 Decoding complexity
As cybercriminals embrace advanced tools, the evolving threat landscape demands innovative strategies to combat increasingly sophisticated and far-reaching attacks.

### 2.1 The cyberthreat landscape
Ransomware remains the top organizational cyber risk year on year, with 45% of respondents ranking it as a top concern in this year’s survey. According to leaders at the Annual Meeting on Cybersecurity 2024, significant innovations in ransomware attacks should be expected. This is compounded by the continued adoption of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), entrenching the commoditization of the ransomware model.[^8]

Cyber-enabled fraud ranks as the second-highest organizational cyber risk for 2025, viewed by CEOs as a significant threat alongside ransomware and supply chain disruptions. At the same time, identity theft climbs to the top of the agenda, emerging as the primary personal cyber risk for both CISOs and CEOs.

![Organizational cyber risks ranked – 2025](Image description)

![Changes in view of personal cyber risk, 2024–2025](Image description)

Cyberattackers are adopting new tools to increase the effectiveness and scope of familiar forms of attack, such as ransomware and business email compromise (BEC). GenAI tools are lowering the cost of the phishing and social engineering campaigns that give attackers access to organizations. Therefore, while the core character of cyberattacks has remained stable, organizations may need to place additional emphasis on protecting themselves against well-developed phishing and cyber-fraud campaigns.

Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) platforms continue to be a dominant and rapidly growing business model in the criminal landscape, allowing individuals or groups without technical expertise to engage in illicit online activities by purchasing the necessary tools and support.[^9] This model, which is already well established among criminal groups, has progressively been adopted in other areas of cybercrime, such as AI-enhanced phishing attacks. These platforms present a challenge, as they remove the barriers for entry into cybercriminal activities. While progress has been made in dismantling some of the platforms, enforcement efforts remain inconsistent as CaaS platforms continue to thrive.

> The rapid advancements and increasing adoption of digital platforms globally is matched by an equally evolving cyberthreat landscape. Cybercrime today is increasing not just in scale but also in sophistication. As our digital footprints widen, so does the potential attack surface for nefarious actors. It is essential that we work together to address this growing menace. The borderless nature of the internet necessitates collaboration across various jurisdictional limitations to ensure that threat actors have no safe haven for their evil activities.
>
> Ivan John E. Uy, Secretary of Information and Communications Technology of the Philippines

The surge in the volume and value of cyber-enabled fraud has attracted “traditionally” violent organized crime groups into the cybercrime market. The interaction of organized cybercrime with organized violent crime groups is changing the nature of cybercrime and greatly increasing their social impact.

This is perhaps most starkly shown by the trafficking of more than 220,000 people to forcibly work in online scam-farms in South-East Asia.[^10] With such farms engaging in the harvesting of data, disinformation and social engineering to name a few capabilities, they are essentially becoming “criminal service providers”.[^11] According to the Global Anti-Scam Alliance, scammers have siphoned away more than $1 trillion globally in the past year, costing certain countries losses of more than 3% of their gross domestic product (GDP).[^12]

The entry of traditional organized crime groups into the cybercrime arena changes the character of the criminal market. Organized crime groups are accustomed to causing physical harm and are arguably less concerned about the risk created by attacking critical social services such as medical services.[^13] When this cultural change is paired with the scale provided by CaaS platforms, the range of organizations that could be targeted by attacks such as ransomware becomes wider.[^14]

> Cybercrime has persistently evolved alongside the threat landscape, and its reach extends beyond financial loss, becoming a disruptive force that threatens our societies. We must remain vigilant and collaborate across sectors to safeguard the future of our digital world. Cybercrime’s impact is far-reaching – it can halt operations, undermine confidence and permeate to our operational technology and critical infrastructure. In the year ahead, we must prioritize not only defence but proactive and systemic disruption of these criminal networks as part of our collective effort to ensure cyber resilience and protect our digital future.

GenAI tools are reshaping the cybercrime landscape by enabling criminals to refine their methods, and automate and personalize their techniques. With 47% of organizations citing their top concern surrounding GenAI as the advance of adversarial capabilities, cybercriminals are harnessing the efficiency of AI to automate and personalize deceptive communications. Some 42% of organizations experienced a successful social engineering attack in the past year, a number that can only increase with advances and the malicious adoption of AI.

![Cybersecurity issues linked to GenAI](Image description)

Cybercriminals are using GenAI to convincingly replicate the communication styles of an organization’s senior leaders. These tools harness contextual data from sources such as social media, public statements or leaked documents, making social engineering attempts much more sophisticated and challenging to identify. GenAI also supports attackers in developing credible social engineering attacks in a wider range of languages, which helps threat actors target a greater number of people in more countries at a lower cost.

> Finally, GenAI lowers the barriers to entry into the cybercrime arena in terms of cost and required expertise. GenAI is expected to streamline the process from the exploitation of vulnerabilities to the deployment of malware, scaling up operations that were previously reliant solely on human capabilities.

By understanding the complexity of the cyberthreat landscape as well as the behaviour and motivations of cybercriminals, organizations can better assess the risks facing them and then tailor and prioritize security strategies to enhance resilience against such threats.

> The complexity of today’s cyber threats and evolving criminal methodologies requires a unified response. This response requires coordination not only from the global law enforcement community, but with cybersecurity experts who provide their own talents, experiences and expertise. In 2024, INTERPOL’s Cybercrime Directorate supported several regional and global cybercrime operations that were very successful in large part due to these collaborations. As we move into 2025, our team will continue to pursue new partnerships and strengthen existing ones to have even greater impact disrupting cybercriminal activity.
>
> Neal Jetton, Director, Cybercrime Directorate, International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL)

> As global leaders, we see cyber challenges as more than just a threat – they’re a chance to make a real difference in how we protect people and businesses. Malicious cyber activity takes a significant toll on the most vulnerable populations, so we must urgently drive ecosystem-level solutions that bring everyone together, from small local companies to big global corporations. By collaborating like never before, we can turn the tables in 2025, make systemic change and create digital defences that work for everyone.

When augmented with GenAI, threat actors can create convincing impersonations of the voice, video, images and writing styles of senior leaders. When these deepfakes are maintained over prolonged interactions with targeted staff, they can be used to defraud organizations or help attackers gain access to their IT systems. Accenture’s research has noted a 223% rise in the trade of deepfake-related tools on dark web forums between Q1 2023 and Q1 2024.[^15]

Additionally, 55% of CISOs polled during the Annual Meeting on Cybersecurity 2024 stated that deepfakes pose a moderate-to-significant cyberthreat to their organization. With staff remaining the real target of deepfake attacks, as well as phishing campaigns in general, organizations will need to rethink how they train and protect everyone, from employees to the C-suite and board, about new patterns of cybercrime.

Old scams and new technology – Arup
> Arup hit the headlines for the wrong reasons when the firm was targeted by criminals who succeeded in pulling off a major fraud. “Fraudsters use deepfake technology to trick employee into paying millions” ran one headline, but the story is more subtle than that.
>
> Clearly, media attention was driven by the fact that the fraudsters used manipulated videos and voicemails to convince people they were talking to genuine colleagues. But as Arup’s Chief Information Officer, Rob Greig, pointed out, the interesting part is that the criminals did not penetrate the firm’s IT networks or disrupt business operations. Rather, they used “technology enhanced social engineering” to convince people to process transactions.
>
> It was a sophisticated, preplanned attack that used tactics such as phishing, vishing and smishing, all backed by fake documentation and a false sense of urgency. At its heart, though, this was an old-fashioned payment scam with a modern makeover.
>
> Since the incident, the firm has reviewed every aspect of its systems and processes. Among the key lessons learned is that cybersecurity alone is not enough. Building real resilience requires a culture of critical assessment and the ability to spot red flags across the organization.
>
> The most important lesson, though, is that industry, the police and public authorities all need to find better ways to share information and frustrate the fraudsters.

Escalating geopolitical tensions and increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats pose significant risks to critical infrastructure, which depends on networks of interconnected devices and legacy systems. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine exemplifies these vulnerabilities, with critical sectors such as energy, telecommunications, water and heating repeatedly targeted by both cyber and physical attacks.[^16] These attacks often focus on disrupting control systems and compromising data, highlighting the critical risks associated with operational technology (OT). As cyberthreats continue to evolve, they not only threaten system functionality but also jeopardize human safety, increasing the severity and consequences of disruptions to vital infrastructure. Some critical, high-risk areas to monitor are:

**Water facilities**
Cyberattacks on water facilities pose significant risks to public safety, infrastructure and national security. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) of the United States outlined these risks in a toolkit, emphasizing the vulnerabilities in OT systems used in water facilities, such as remote access points and outdated software.[^17] Cybercriminals can exploit these weaknesses to disrupt water-treatment processes, causing potential contamination, loss of service or other hazardous consequences. A notable example of these threats occurred in October 2024, when a cyberattack targeted the largest water utility in the United States, disrupting operations and raising alarms about the security of critical infrastructure.[^18]

**Biosecurity**
Rapid technological advances have redefined the biological threat landscape, with biosecurity coming to the forefront. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that advances in artificial intelligence, cyberattacks and genetic engineering could pose potentially catastrophic risks to global biosecurity.[^19] A 2024 WHO report highlighted several ways in which cyberthreats could compromise biosecurity, including accessing sensitive data or research, disruption of laboratory security systems, theft or sabotage of biosecurity-relevant information and espionage for competitive or harmful objectives.[^20] Furthermore, cyberattacks could incapacitate essential laboratory systems, interrupting operations and causing loss of data integrity, which would delay critical research or compromise safety protocols. Over the course of 2024, two laboratories were targeted in South Africa and the United Kingdom.[^21] These vulnerabilities underscore the need for advanced cybersecurity measures in biosecurity strategies to address these growing risks.

Simultaneously, the sensitive nature of genomic data poses new risks due to its unique qualities, such as the ability to identify individuals and reveal their familial ties.[^22] These characteristics expose genomic data to threats such as reidentification from seemingly anonymous datasets, unauthorized access leading to privacy violations and potential misuse. The breach of a genetic-testing company in late 2023 that exposed the data of nearly 7 million people has already trained the spotlight on these risks.

> With emerging technologies reshaping the landscape, cyber is no longer limited to the CIA triad: confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Cybersecurity now encompasses human safety and needs to address the real risk to people’s lives when a system is attacked or compromised.
>
> Bushra AlBlooshi, Director of Cybersecurity Governance Risk Management Department, Dubai Electronic Security Centre

> As genomics continues to evolve as a critical field, securing sensitive biological data, the interconnected systems and the users becomes essential. The protection of bioinformatics platforms, along with the prevention of misuse in biotechnical applications, is vital. This includes safeguarding data analytics and securing the broader ecosystem of interconnected systems to mitigate risks across sectors. As these emerging technologies grow, the need for robust security in bioinformatics, their analytics and cyber-physical systems will only increase, creating new resiliency challenges for cybersecurity leaders.

**Communications infrastructure**
From large-scale state-sponsored cyber espionage via telecommunications infrastructure to the targeting of satellites and undersea cables, geopolitical tensions continue to manifest through the increasing number of attacks on critical communications infrastructure.[^23]

Following the 2022 attack on ViaSat’s satellite network that highlighting the consequences of a cyberattack on military communication and civilian life in Europe, there were 124 further recorded cyber operations against the space sector in the context of the conflict in Ukraine.[^24] With the increased reliance on space technologies, it is a prime target for espionage, operational disruption and weaponization.

Undersea cables are crucial for global data flow and economic exchange. Their strategic role makes them vulnerable to monitoring and disruption, especially with limited defence measures and rising geopolitical tensions. Incidents in the Baltic Sea since the start of the conflict in Ukraine highlight the urgent need to protect these critical pieces of infrastructure.[^25]

**Climate and energy**
As the global climate crisis intensifies, its implications for cybersecurity are becoming increasingly significant. Modern technology relies heavily on substantial energy consumption, rendering power grids highly attractive targets for cybercriminals. Simultaneously, energy systems are undergoing a profound transformation as societies transition to renewable technologies. It is essential that these emerging energy systems are designed with security as a foundational priority; otherwise, in the effort to address an existential crisis with urgency, there is a risk of introducing vulnerabilities that could undermine the reliability of this new energy infrastructure, with far-reaching consequences for the economy and society.

### 2.2 Security in the Intelligent Age
> “The Intelligent Age – driven by rapid advancements in AI, quantum computing and blockchain – is transforming everything and changing it right now, in real time.” The advent of the Intelligent Age brings unprecedented opportunities and unprecedented risks; the importance of security in safeguarding the promise of these transformative technologies cannot be overstated.[^26]

> The security of AI systems (or lack thereof) can have far-reaching implications given the increasing adoption of AI. My belief is that AI should be developed and deployed in a safe, secure and trustworthy manner for the public good. Advancing this will need an inclusive, multilateral and multistakeholder approach. Digital technology like AI is borderless and global. We must cooperate and work together to secure AI, even in the face of ongoing geopolitical tensions and strategic competition in critical and emerging technologies.
>
> David Koh, Commissioner of Cybersecurity and Chief Executive, Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA)

Emerging technologies present significant opportunities for organizations to enhance efficiency and optimize operations. As a result, many organizations are actively developing strategies to integrate these technologies into their infrastructure. However, the cyber risks associated with the underlying technologies or their implementation in organizations often do not receive the attention and consideration they require.

While AI is not a new phenomenon, the advent of GenAI has accelerated the adoption of AI in organizations around the globe. Organizations are testing or adopting AI technologies to drive efficiencies and gain a competitive advantage. However, they do not always design strategies and processes for secure implementation. When adopting new technologies, it is critical for organizations to assess the cyber risks they entail and implement the related cybersecurity controls to ensure operational and wider business cyber resilience.

According to the GCO survey, 66% of organizations anticipate that AI will have the most significant impact on cybersecurity in the coming year. However, only 37% of respondents report having a process in place to assess the security of AI tools prior to deployment. This creates a risk that organizations may implement or adopt AI systems – whether developed internally or sourced from third-party providers – without fully considering the associated cybersecurity risks and associated mitigation measures, while potentially introducing vulnerabilities into their IT estate.

![Cybersecurity vulnerabilities in 2025 predicted by professionals](Image description)

This issue is particularly alarming for smaller organizations, of which 69% lack adequate safeguards for the secure deployment of AI technologies. These could include, for example, ensuring all new assets (devices and software) relating to AI infrastructure are inventoried, ensuring the security of training data and monitoring the behaviour of AI systems to detect manipulation in a timely manner.[^27] This contributes to the widening of cyber inequity as it leaves less-resourced entities more exposed to the risks of insecure AI models. It also increases the collective vulnerability of the ecosystem in which these smaller organizations operate.

A holistic approach is necessary for the secure adoption of AI: 74% of global CEOs surveyed by KPMG agree that building a strong cyber culture is central to integrating AI safely into their organization.[^28]

> The LLMs currently in use are constitutively insecure, and the adversarial attacks and supply chain sabotage that are possible are not being addressed in a sufficiently meaningful way. Integrating these models into critical infrastructure before such attack vectors are remedied is dangerous and needs to be reevaluated.

Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity: Balancing Risks and Rewards
> The AI Governance Alliance, launched by the World Economic Forum in June 2023, seeks to provide guidance on the responsible design, development and deployment of artificial intelligence systems. Its report, Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity: Balancing Risks and Rewards, equips top leaders with a set of questions that can help them define and communicate the key parameters within which decision-making on AI adoption and its associated cybersecurity can be made:
>
> 1. Has the right risk tolerance for AI technologies been set, and is it understood by all risk owners?
> 2. Is there a proper balancing of risks against rewards when new AI projects are considered?
> 3. Is there an effective process in place to govern and keep track of the deployment of AI projects within the organization?
> 4. Is there a clear understanding of organization-specific vulnerabilities and cyber risks related to the use or adoption of AI technologies?
> 5. Is there clarity on which stakeholders within the organization need to be involved in assessing and mitigating the cyber risks from AI adoption?
> 6. Are there assurance processes in place to ensure that AI deployments are consistent with the organization’s broader organizational policies and legal and regulatory obligations – for example, relating to data protection or health and safety?

AI holds the promise of transforming methods to defend against cyberthreats. It can give defenders the upper hand – with advanced tools able to quickly spot and respond to dangers – if they can keep up with the pace of AI integration. Simply put, AI can augment human abilities, making cyber defence stronger and more efficient.

AI is transforming cybersecurity by reducing toil and freeing up manpower, enabling systems to process vast amounts of data for early threat detection and uncovering hidden risks. This technology can enhance threat alert triage, prioritization, anomaly detection and pattern recognition. It can also classify vulnerabilities, automate patching, accelerate data processing and manage configurations.[^29] Moreover, AI can serve as a security adviser – like an “AI-CISO” or “virtual CISO” – improving software security and optimizing decision-making to make the most of limited resources. Given recent advances in AI agents, resource optimization and autonomous assistants that can help defenders to this end may certainly be on the horizon.[^30]

Large language models (LLMs) also offer the opportunity to collect richer intelligence, powering the threat-intelligence cycle. AI models can analyse and categorize the types of questions attackers ask, their interaction patterns and even linguistic markers that might identify specific groups or individuals. This data can then feed back into threat-intelligence systems, refining detection algorithms and providing achievable insights to cybersecurity teams by refining the content analysis and triage stages.[^31] Backed by AI and machine learning, defenders can use continuous monitoring and real-time visibility to better identify and address software vulnerabilities such as zero-day threats and exploits. Advanced threat detection systems using behavioural analysis, network segmentation and machine learning can contain potential breaches and limit the persistence of threat actors within compromised environments.

The integration of LLMs into honeypots represents a new frontier in deception-based cybersecurity.[^32] By embedding LLMs into these decoy environments, defenders can create sophisticated, dynamic interactions that adapt to adversarial behaviour in real time.[^33] At the core of this innovation is the ability of LLMs to simulate human-like responses, making honeypots far more convincing to attackers. Unlike static systems or preconfigured responses, LLMs can generate contextually appropriate, nuanced dialogues that respond appropriately to attacker queries, prolonging engagement and misleading attackers into thinking they are interacting with legitimate systems. This creates an environment in which malicious actors unknowingly reveal their intent, methods and even operational details while thinking they are making progress in their attack. One notable project, SPHINX, supported by the European Union (EU)’s 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, aims to lure attackers, learn from their attacks and deploy security controls to address them. The AI Honeypot uses advanced algorithms to process attack data for AI detection and management.[^34] LLMs can help create realistic “bait” assets, such as fake credentials, plausible system configurations or generated content that mirrors the sensitive data attackers seek. These assets, underpinned by LLMs, help maintain the illusion of authenticity, increasing the likelihood that attackers will stay in the honeypot longer, giving defenders more time to respond.

Quantum computing offers significant economic and scientific opportunities by unlocking unprecedented computing power. However, quantum computing advances also accelerate the emergence of security risks, particularly the potential to break public-key encryption, which is vital for securing digital systems such as online banking and government communications. While the timeline for quantum computing’s full potential remains uncertain, the associated quantum security risks are already at play.

In a focus group at the 2024 Annual Meeting on Cybersecurity, 40% of organizations indicated that they have started to take proactive steps by conducting risk assessment to understand the quantum threat. Many organizations have been increasingly vigilant about threats such as “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later”, where malicious actors collect encrypted data now with plans to decrypt it once quantum computing can break existing encryption, posing significant challenges for both current and future data security. However, some organizations are still awaiting support from industry standards, guidelines and government regulations.

Multiple efforts have been taken to spur action. The G7 Cyber Expert Group identified a list of risks to financial system security, providing governments and central banks with key recommendations while calling for action.[^35] The World Economic Forum in collaboration with the Financial Conduct Authority also developed recommendations to inform global regulatory procedures to help ensure a collaborative and globally harmonized approach to quantum security.[^36]

Recently, the National Institute of Standards and Cryptography (NIST) released three highly anticipated post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithm standards that were built to withstand cyberattacks from quantum computers.[^37] Beyond PQC standards, other technologies – quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum random number generation (QRNG) – have also been garnering attention because they could help mitigate, either individually or in combination, the risk posed by quantum to public-key cryptography.

A successful transition begins with strong cyber foundations and a clear quantum-readiness strategy, emphasizing the need for organizations to begin their quantum-readiness journey today.

### 2.3 Growing ecosystem interdependencies and risks
Since the launch of the Global Cybersecurity Outlook in 2022, the survey has shown a consistent concern among business and cyber executives about the state of the cyber ecosystem. At the 2024 Annual Meeting on Cybersecurity, cyber experts identified vulnerabilities within interconnected supply chains as the leading contributor to the growing complexity in cyberspace. This year’s Outlook will analyse how intricate supply chain dependencies, geopolitical risk, inequity and regulations are affecting the cyber resilience of ecosystems.

> As digitalization advances, cyber threats are becoming increasingly complex, particularly as interdependencies across third-party supply chains and broader ecosystems grow. Cyber attackers need only succeed once to cause significant harm, while our collective defences – spanning organizations, suppliers and global networks – must be robust and cohesive at all times. To effectively safeguard the energy infrastructure that supplies billions globally, we need closer collaboration and transparency between all stakeholders, both locally and internationally, to mitigate risks across the supply chain and digital ecosystem.

The growing complexity of supply chains and the limited control organizations have over them has become a primary concern for executives, emerging as the top cyber risk from an ecosystem perspective. This year, 54% of large organizations highlight supply chain challenges as the greatest barrier to achieving cyber resilience. By comparison, third-party risk management does not feature among the top five concerns for smaller organizations.
