Operational expenditure (OpEx) budgets in 2024 
didn’t align with 2023 predictions, where over 50% 
of respondents expected steady or increased OpEx 
budgets. Instead, 44% reported an increase or steady 
OpEx budget. Capital expenditure (CapEx) budgets also 
held stable, with only 17% of end users noting a decrease.

Cloud adoption in the physical security industry grew fast between 2022 and 2023 
while results in the most recent 2024 survey revealed a deceleration. In 2024, 38% of 
end users reported that over 25% of their physical security environment was cloud or 
hybrid cloud – down 6% from 2023.
### Cloud adoption meets physical security realities
![FIGURE G: PROPORTIONS OF RESPONDENTS PLANNING TO INCORPORATE CLOUD.]
Timeline towards the cloud
When end users were asked what has impacted their organization’s adoption of cloud 
solutions, budgetary reasons related to “cloud storage, data retention, and bandwidth 
costs” were reported. “Fear of data loss and overall control” was their second reason, 
further demonstrating that physical security practitioners are looking to move 
workloads to the cloud in an incremental fashion, at a pace suitable for their business.

Organizations with smaller physical security systems are more likely to use the cloud 
for storage, while those with larger systems are not adopting as fast. In fact, 41% of 
all respondents say they’ve slowed their cloud adoption due to costs for storage, data 
retention, and bandwidth.

Indicators point to smaller organizations with less storage and bandwidth concerns 
benefiting more quickly from the convenience and accessibility of video surveillance as 
a service (VSaaS). In the face of deploying larger, more complex systems to the cloud, 
it’s not surprising organizations are reviewing their investments in advance of starting 
work, or as the data comes in from early deployments. The need to find an optimal ROI 
in the cloud has become a pressing issue.
It is clear that managing cloud expenses is an emerging challenge in physical security 
and the issue of cloud waste is one that organizations are beginning to look at closely.
Insights 
 
Most organizations lack proactive cloud cost-saving strategies 
 
A Gartner survey shows that companies waste an average of 35% of their cloud 
spending, with waste levels ranging from 15% in well-optimized environments to 55% 
in unoptimized ones.

Looking at the future of cloud adoption, it’s clear from the 2024 survey results that the 
majority of organizations see the best way to leverage cloud successfully is through 
hybrid deployments. Smaller organizations, with presumably less hardware, retention, 
and data concerns, are predictably more interested and open to full cloud deployments.

## Key takeaways
Coming out of the market uncertainties 
of 2024, end users are making practical 
plans for 2025. They’re looking for 
reliable, value-driven solutions that 
enhance security without introducing 
unnecessary complexity or costs. 
The industry-wide focus is shifting to 
technology that meets day-to-day needs, 
while they continue to track innovative 
technology closely to gauge when it is 
right for them to implement.
The desire to innovate, adopt new 
technology, and deploy physical security 
in new ways persists, however, end users 
are looking for real-world solutions that 
can reliably improve their work and 
efficiency within their budget. The move 
to the cloud and adoption of AI tools 
remain top of mind but are grounded in 
business realities resulting in prioritizing 
hybrid-cloud deployments and a 
measured approach to finding strong use 
cases for new technology.
Access control is the top priority 
for the 5th year running. Projects 
focused on video surveillance 
ranked second.
Access  
control #1
### Takeaway 1 
Practicality over hype
At the heart of priorities and budget, 
is the ongoing need to build reliable 
access control and video surveillance 
systems. These remain the top of mind 
for physical security departments. 
Organizations are focusing on ways to 
adopt new technology into their existing 
infrastructure to help them improve 
operations, increase cyber resiliency, and 
deliver physical security in a more cost-
efficient way.

### Takeaway 2 
IT shapes decision-making
IT’s role is to protect digital networks and keep data 
safe. Physical security protects people, buildings, 
and other assets. But today these roles are more 
interconnected than ever. Results of the survey 
show that this partnership has resulted in greater 
collaboration with IT in buying decisions.
By combining expertise, these teams work together 
to the benefit of the organization to navigate the 
complexities of technology evaluation, and support 
the many parties involved in the buying process. 
Together, IT and physical security teams can bring a 
more complete security approach by combining the 
threat assessment and response expertise of physical 
security professionals with IT’s specialized skills in 
network design, data analytics, and cybersecurity. This 
collaboration strengthens both organizational safety, 
network security and operational efficiency, creating a 
more resilient and unified security posture.
- 50+% of all respondents say IT departments are 
involved in purchasing decisions.

STATE OF PHYSICAL SECURITY 2025
Physical security data is now commonly shared with 
IT departments but beyond this, there may be limited 
knowledge of its contents in an organization. With IT 
holding the keys to physical security and often system 
integration requests, physical security department 
leaders may not fully understand or control the 
additional organizational value that can be derived from 
their own systems.
Integrations between security systems, other 
IoT devices, and operational technologies can 
fundamentally provide value to business operations. 
Investment is required to identify problems and explore 
beneficial integrations and data sources from existing 
systems. When this concept is embraced it can turn 
a traditional cost center like physical security into a 
return on investment when its data is used to drive 
business decisions. This fact opens the door to the 
physical security team helping and influencing broader 
organizational strategy and decision-making.
