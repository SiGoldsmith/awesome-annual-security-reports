- The Frost & Sullivan’s 2023 Cloud User Survey surveyed 2,138 C-level executives in 13 countries across
the globe and found that 32% of respondents believed that the cloud is the most crucial part of their
digital transformation journey. Many decision-makers believe that cloud adoption can help improve
operational efficiency and customer experience, enabling organizations to realize sustainable growth in
the modern business landscape.
- As the cloud adoption rate increases exponentially, as-a-service technologies emerge, including
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications—Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Salesforce, and Slack,
for instance. These have become widely popular and are quickly becoming an integral component of
many organizations’ business operations.
- SaaS applications have received an enthusiastic reception among organizations globally. They reduce the
need for large upfront investments or lengthy implementation cycles because SaaS applications typically
operate on a subscription model and can connect easily with other cloud-based services through
application programming interfaces (APIs), minimizing the need for an extensive setup.
- Their ease of integration, scalability, and flexibility drive the adoption rate of SaaS applications among
organizations globally. However, as users benefit from SaaS applications, mass adoption of SaaS
applications has unintentionally caused SaaS sprawl.
- SaaS sprawl refers to the process of accumulating numerous SaaS applications across departments to
the point where security teams cannot have full visibility into their entire SaaS ecosystem because
business owners and department leaders procure new SaaS applications without informing the security
teams beforehand.

- On a micro level, each SaaS application comes with its own set of configurations, policies, and access
controls. Many business owners and department leaders often overlook this factor and do not inform the
security teams when they adopt new SaaS applications because they see security as an inhibitor to
growth. As a result, they are willing to sacrifice security for higher productivity and business goal
achievement.
- For security teams, manually managing these aspects for a small pool of SaaS applications is a viable
task, but performing across tens or even hundreds of SaaS applications becomes increasingly
impractical, and it is challenging for them to ensure the continuous protection of SaaS applications that
they are not aware of.
- As the SaaS ecosystem expands without check, it becomes difficult for organizations to have full
visibility into the applications used, their configurations, the identities using those SaaS applications, and
how those SaaS applications interact with each other. This lack of visibility limits the security teams’
ability to enforce consistent security policies and controls, creating blind spots and massive security gaps
that attackers can easily exploit.
- The rapidly increasing number of SaaS applications in the SaaS ecosystem effectively expands the attack
surface that security teams need to monitor. Each application represents a potential entry point for
attackers, especially if the application is poorly configured or lacks proper security controls. SaaS
applications onboarded without the knowledge of security teams are also a potential entry point because
those applications often do not have security policies and controls.
- This unchecked SaaS ecosystem growth has created an environment ripe for attacks, and SaaS
applications are becoming an increasingly attractive target. SaaS-related breach incidents in the past 12
months include high-profile victims, such as Microsoft Outlook, Activision Blizzard, and Snowflake.

- Organizations are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of full visibility and control over their
entire SaaS ecosystem, driving the need for a security solution that addresses these issues. At its core, a
SaaS security posture management (SSPM) solution provides a single-pane-of-glass view of an
organization’s SaaS ecosystem with centralized controls to identify and mitigate the risks and
misconfigurations of SaaS applications.
- SSPM solutions empower organizations to secure their rapidly expanding SaaS ecosystem by
continuously monitoring and identifying security risks and misconfigurations, identifying sanctioned and
unsanctioned SaaS applications, generating alerts based on prioritized risks, revoking excessive
permissions, and remediating identified risks and misconfigurations. Alert generation in an SSPM
solution often incorporates contextual analysis, analyzing vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, access
anomalies, and potential threats by factoring the broader context, such as the sensitivity of data inside
the SaaS applications, integrations with other SaaS applications, and the role of the SaaS applications
within the organization’s environment.
- The features below are the foundational capabilities of an SSPM solution.
- SaaS Applications Inventory and Visibility: This includes automatic discovery of SaaS applications and
regular maintenance of an up-to-date inventory that contains all SaaS applications in the organization’s
SaaS ecosystem.
- Configuration Monitoring and Management: SSPM solutions must continuously monitor and evaluate
SaaS application configurations to identify misconfigurations and risks, ensure compliance with
regulatory standards, and assess alignment with the organization’s broader security policies and
controls.

- Risk Management: SSPM solutions must assess risks associated with SaaS applications, configurations,
and access patterns and prioritize those risks based on severity, internal security controls, and potential
impact.
- Remediation Support: SSPM solutions must ensure an efficient remediation process that is not strictly
automated and, as a result, has the flexibility to adjust responses based on organizational preferences.
This includes providing remediation advice, manual remediation, or outsourcing remediation to third-
party security tools.
- SaaS-to-SaaS Applications Management: This includes tracking of app-to-app integrations and third-
party connections to ensure inactive SaaS-to-SaaS or third-party connections no longer have access to
the SaaS applications and the data in them.
- Identity Access Management: An SSPM solution must monitor and evaluate both human and non-human
identities to ensure secure and appropriate access.
- Streamlined Governance and Compliance: SSPM solutions ensure that SaaS applications comply with
regulatory standards and internal security policies.
- Reporting and Analytics: This includes providing a dashboard that offers a centralized overview of the
entire SaaS applications, with insights into the security posture of the SaaS ecosystem.
- Organizations may find it difficult to select an SSPM solution because the market is still developing, and
vendors are taking different approaches to achieve SSPM outcomes.
- The multi-faceted nature of SaaS security requires adaptive solutions. Vendors have taken the chance to
provide solid foundational SSPM capabilities and offer deeper expertise in specialized areas, such as
identity risk management, data-centric approach, and SaaS-to-SaaS governance.

- As a result, it is critical that organizations select an SSPM vendor that can address their security
challenges and does not disrupt their business operations during evaluation.
- Organizations consider the following features that extend the functionalities of a foundational SSPM
solution into a more comprehensive SSPM solution.
- Identity-driven SaaS security that provides comprehensive monitoring and control over all types of
identities, such as human users, API tokens, service accounts, OAuth keys, and connected devices within
the SaaS ecosystem. This includes continuously tracking identity life cycles, access patterns, and risk
levels while providing contextual risk scoring based on many factors, including device health, location,
data sensitivity, and behavior patterns. This ensures that all identities are continuously authenticated,
authorized, and monitored.
- Enhanced visibility into SaaS-to-SaaS connections that provides an in-depth look into the connections
between SaaS applications because these integrations let them share data. Enhancing visibility enables
the monitoring and identification of security risks, possible data exposure from data flows, and
compliance violations, which then allows relevant remediation actions, such as revoking permissions or
disabling inactive or redundant SaaS-to-SaaS applications.
- Real-time detection and response capabilities that continuously monitor application behaviors, user
activities, and data movements to identify security risks and misconfiguration in real time. Any identified
security risks and misconfigurations will immediately trigger response actions before escalating further,
without human intervention.

- Consolidation into broader SaaS security or Secure Access Secure Edge (SASE) platforms to capitalize on
the consolidation trend, because demand increases for a centralized platform that integrates security
capabilities. Using SSPM as a foundational component to build a SaaS Security Platform that addresses
use cases beyond security posture management enables a more holistic SaaS security approach.
Integrating into SASE enables more robust protection for modern organizations, ensuring secure
connectivity to enhanced SaaS security.
- Risk-based prioritization based on contextual and behavioral analysis that moves beyond static risk
assessments based on pre-defined or baseline rules and toward a more dynamic risk evaluation
(incorporating AI/ML to bring contextual awareness to SaaS activity monitoring) enables organizations to
understand how certain user behaviors, environmental factors, and SaaS activities results in risks and
misconfigurations. The additional context that this capability provides enhances the accuracy of its
prioritization capability, producing highly accurate risk scoring that reduces false positives and
accelerates remediation.
- Expansive breadth and depth of coverage for SaaS applications due to the increasingly expansive SaaS
ecosystem, resulting from the rapid utilization rate of SaaS applications, increases the need for SSPM
solutions to feature comprehensive SaaS application coverage to ensure consistent security policies and
controls across all SaaS applications in an organization, including industry-specific applications.

## Growth Environment

- Based on Frost & Sullivan’s 2023 Voice of the Enterprise Security Customer survey, which surveyed
more than 2,448 C-level executives across the United States, France, Germany, the United Kingdom,
Japan, Australia, and Brazil, 49% of respondents claimed that SSPM has been used in their daily security
operations, while 40% of them shared that they have plans to add the solution by the end of 2024. This
is in line with the projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 51% from 2024 to 2029.
- The rapid emergence of SSPM as a critical security solution to address risks and misconfigurations in the
SaaS ecosystem is the result of the growing awareness of its functionalities and benefits, particularly
among forward-looking regions such as North America, which will remain the largest revenue
contributor in the global SSPM market in the next five years. The region has a mature SaaS ecosystem
and a higher cybersecurity maturity level than others.
- Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), meanwhile, are increasingly recognizing the importance of
SaaS security and will explore SSPM in the coming years, but the region’s methodological and risk-
avoidant approach due to the need to comply with stringent regulations, such as the General Data
Protection Regulation, has resulted in a slightly slower adoption rate than North America.
- Asia-Pacific is experiencing a rapid digitalization trend that has accelerated its adoption rate of SaaS
applications. However, the market cannot be treated as a singular market because the maturity level
varies between countries. Countries with higher cybersecurity maturity levels, such as Singapore,
Australia, and Japan, will drive the adoption of SSPM while Indonesia and Malaysia may lag due to their
cost-effectiveness priority.
- Investments in SSPM in Latin America remain limited due to the region’s preference for on-premises
environments, resulting in lower cybersecurity maturity. Highly regulated sectors, such as banking,
financial services, and insurance (BFSI) will be the main SSPM growth driver in the region.

- Awareness of SSPM may benefit from the growing number of high-profile security incidents linked to
SaaS applications, such as Microsoft Outlook and Equifax, which have spooked many organizations,
forcing them to secure their SaaS application environments.
- This urgency has driven organizations of all sizes to invest in SSPM solutions. Large organizations
currently lead the way in SSPM adoption due to their vast SaaS ecosystems, which often span multiple
departments, countries, and regions, and have strict compliance requirements.
- Small organizations are also adopting SSPM but at a slower pace due to budget restraints and lack of in-
house security expertise. This forces them to focus on foundational security rather than embrace more
advanced tools, such as SSPM. Those two factors will continue to loom over small organizations, which
might hinder market growth over the next five years. Even so, the segment will still see rapid SSPM
adoption.
- The disparity in adoption between large and small organizations also extends to different sectors, such
as BFSI, retail/eCommerce, technology, and healthcare medical, which lead SSPM adoption due to
stringent compliance requirements, the urgent need to secure sensitive data within the SaaS
applications, and the critical urgency to ensure secure access to SaaS applications regardless of
geographical locations. Manufacturing and energy, meanwhile, are also adopting SSPM but at a steadier
pace due to the sectors’ unique operational needs.

- The growing urgency and horizontal/vertical-driven SSPM adoption has come after many business
owners and department leaders overlooked the security risks associated with SaaS applications. Many
decided to prioritize productivity and business goals by adopting SaaS applications without first
informing their security teams.
- As stated before, this has created SaaS sprawl, because the pace of SaaS adoption far outstrips the
security teams’ ability to keep track of all SaaS applications in their environment. They lack
comprehensive visibility across their entire SaaS ecosystem, leaving organizations with a massive
security gap.
- Organizations’ growing need for SSPM is one of the many factors driving the global SSPM market. In
2024, the market recorded an estimated revenue of $290.7 million with a strong year-on-year growth
rate of 75.3%.
- Frost & Sullivan projects that the global SSPM market will achieve a CAGR rate of 51% from 2024 until
2029—it will achieve a revenue of $2.28 billion at the end of the CAGR period in 2029 because the
utilization of SaaS applications will increase exponentially over the years, particularly in Asia-Pacific and
Latin America, increasing demand for SSPM.
- With organizations globally becoming more reliant on SaaS applications, the latter will become a prime
target for attackers seeking access to sensitive and critical data.

- While spending in the cybersecurity markets has grown steadily in the last few years, high inflation
rates and unfavorable exchange rates are forcing organizations to take a more conservative approach to
cybersecurity investments and focus on revenue-generating activities until the economic landscape
stabilizes. This will be a large factor in the slowdown of the SSPM market in the long run.
- Besides the economic slowdown, the volatile geopolitical landscape will play a big part in limiting the
growth of the SSPM market. The possible imposition of tariffs could strain organizations’ financial
resources, discouraging many organizations from investing in security tools, such as SSPM, which is
often treated as an emerging security solution with an unproven return on investment compared to
older, more established security solutions.
- A factor explaining the hesitancy that surrounds emerging technology adoption, such as SSPM, is
organizations’ belief that it can be costly and time-consuming. They consider that they lack the time to
properly develop their skills in an era where trends are rapidly evolving. However, failure to adapt to the
latest trends might cause them to lose customers to competitors that can adapt to the latest consumer
needs faster.

## Frost Radar Competitive Environment

- Frost & Sullivan has included more than 17 vendors in the Growth Opportunities in Global SaaS Security
Posture Management, 2024–2029 market study. Most of the players are start-ups specializing in
securing SaaS, unlike more mature cybersecurity markets where older cybersecurity vendors dominate.
The market very likely includes more than 17 vendors due to the rapid growth of the SSPM landscape.
- Frost & Sullivan has evaluated the top companies in this Frost Radar analysis. The factors considered to
select vendors and assess their performance on the Growth and Innovation Axes include end-user focus,
geographic presence, and solution portfolio. Companies must have recorded an estimated annual
revenue of at least $3 million in 2024 or have possessed a market share of at least 1% in the total SSPM
market in 2024.
- Frost & Sullivan has excluded certain vendors that meet the inclusion criteria for this Frost Radar but
were unable to share detailed insights into their business performance and container/K8s security
solutions to ensure a fair scoring and comparison. As a result, this Frost & Sullivan analysis features 11
vendors: Adaptive Shield, AppOmni, CheckRed Security, Check Point Technologies, DoControl, Grip
Security, SecureSky, Spin.AI, Suridata, Valence Security, and Varonis. These are the power players in the
SSPM market today.
- The SSPM market will see more participation from start-ups and established cybersecurity vendors
because the demand to secure SaaS environments will grow exponentially. It will become an
increasingly important component of organizations’ business operations, and more organizations will
need to have a better understanding of SSPM solutions’ functionalities and benefits.
- More established cybersecurity vendors will introduce SSPM as a feature of other security products to
expand its use cases, putting themselves in an advantageous position due to the massive consolidation
demand from customers. Start-ups, in turn, might want to capitalize on the growing demand for SaaS
security and offer more advanced capabilities that disrupt the current SSPM market.

- Growth Axis
- The SSPM market is still in its early stages of growth, with many players aggressively battling each
other to establish a solid presence. In that context, companies such as Adaptive Shield, AppOmni,
DoControl, and Valence Security have demonstrated excellent business performance and have emerged
as Growth Axis leaders.
- Adaptive Shield has experienced solid growth momentum. Its revenue is estimated to have grown at a
robust YoY growth of 101.7% in 2024. The company was able to record triple-digit growth because it
expanded its channel partner ecosystem, with more than 300 active business partners worldwide,
which, in turn, allows it to aggressively expand its customer base. The November 2024 announcement of
its acquisition by CrowdStrike will help the company maintain sustainable growth momentum because it
can capitalize on the wide reach that CrowdStrike has built for its other products.
- AppOmni is the second growth leader in the analysis thanks to its consistent performance in the SSPM
market, recording a steady 40.8% YoY growth in 2024. AppOmni’s SSPM solution is designed to meet
the needs of enterprise-level customers. This approach has proven successful in its vast customer
segments, including BFSI, technology, and healthcare, and it claims that 30% of the Fortune 100
companies are its customers.
- DoControl has also maintained a strong growth trajectory in 2024, recording a YoY growth of 90.3% in
2024 and solidifying its position as one of the leading players in the industry. The company has
remarkably highlighted its unique features, such as multi-contextual analysis, bulk remediation, and
employee management, which have helped it stand out in the market. DoControl will expand its
business into EMEA, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific, boosting the company’s growth trajectory in the
coming years.

Frost Radar Competitive Environment (continued)
Frost Radar: SaaS Security Posture Management, 2024
18
- Valence Security is the fastest-growing SSPM player in 2024, recording a tremendous YoY growth of
409.4%. This has helped the company increase its market share by 2% in 2024. It managed to record
triple-digit growth thanks to its strategic partnership with Microsoft which has given them a major
competitive advantage. The partnership enables business and product teams to collaborate closely to
develop joint offerings. This allows it to capitalize on Microsoft’s wide customer base to push its solution
to the market.
- Grip Security is a new SSPM market player that began to record revenue-generating activities in 2024.
However, the company has established itself as one of the top players in the market by registering a
remarkable YoY growth of 161.3%. Its reputation as a pioneer in SaaS identity risk management and its
focus on helping organizations discover shadow SaaS applications has helped Grip Security successfully
differentiate itself from competitors.
- Spin.AI is growing steadily, which reflects favorably on its Growth Axis score. The company offers its
SSPM solution as part of its flagship SpinOne platform. This enables it to upsell or cross-sell and bundle
a broader SaaS security solution featuring its SSPM offering. However, it is mainly perceived as a backup
and recovery company rather than an SSPM provider, which puts its growth momentum at risk.
- Check Point entered the SSPM market after acquiring Atmosec, an early-stage SaaS security company
that provided capabilities such as discovery of malicious SaaS applications, prevention of risky third-
party SaaS communications, and remediation of SaaS misconfigurations. Its SSPM solution can be
purchased as a standalone product but is available as part of its SASE, cloud security posture
management (CSPM), or email security product. This will have an enormous influence on its growth
momentum because Check Point is one of the most recognizable names in the cybersecurity market.

Frost Radar Competitive Environment (continued)
Frost Radar: SaaS Security Posture Management, 2024
19
- Varonis and SecureSky record a solid growth momentum and have a relatively similar approach to how
they position their SSPM solution in the market. Varonis is widely known for its flagship Data Security
Platform. The company has used its platform’s popularity to push for its SSPM solution by bundling it
into its data protection packages. This allows the company to cross-sell and upsell existing customers
who might need to enhance their SaaS security and protect their data.
- SecureSky provides services and products, with its SSPM solution being a part of its continuous threat
exposure management (CTEM) platform. Its position as a service provider that also offers patented
products has enabled the company to position itself uniquely in the market because it can leverage the
relationship it has built with its services to push for its SSPM.
- However, SSPM is not Varonis and SecureSky’s biggest priority. Varonis focuses on its data security
business while SecureSky mainly pushes its CTEM platform to the market. This will cause the market to
overlook their SSPM solutions, affecting their market perception, which can hugely impact their growth
momentum despite the company’s ability to cross-sell or upsell to wide customer bases.
- Suridata has a positive perception in the market thanks to the comprehensiveness of its SSPM solution,
which is integrated into SaaS detection and response (SDR) to form Suridata’s flagship SaaS Security
Platform. It has strong momentum because it is onboarding several Fortune 500 companies onto its
platform, but it has a small market share and revenue compared to other vendors in this analysis.
- CheckRed Security is a new player in the SSPM market. Its SSPM solution is part of its broader cloud
native application protection platform (CNAPP), and it is working closely with managed service providers
to push for its CNAPP. However, it is still mainly known as a CNAPP player, while its SSPM solution is
not as popular as those of other players in this analysis.

20
Frost Radar Competitive Environment (continued)
- Innovation Axis:
- Adaptive Shield, AppOmni, Grip Security, and DoControl are Innovation Axis leaders, with each platform
offering a unique approach to help organizations enhance their SaaS security posture.
- Adaptive Shield combines SSPM and identity threat detection and response (ITDR) to provide a
comprehensive security solution that remediates SaaS applications’ misconfigurations and ensures that
the identities accessing those SaaS applications are continuously monitored for suspicious behavior. Its
SSPM has two standout features that enhance its comprehensive protection across the entire SaaS
stack—the first is its extensive number of out-of-the-box integrations and the second is its device-to-
SaaS risk management. No other companies in this analysis offer integration support as expansive as
Adaptive Shield. It is the only vendor that provides comprehensive device-to-SaaS protection.
- AppOmni covers security for all SaaS applications by leveraging its experts’ insights to identify the latest
security trends and immediately address risks to prevent further damage. It offers a streamlined
compliance process that reduces compliance reporting time by 90% and helps protect top SaaS
applications that store 80% of their most sensitive data. It is particularly strong at securing Salesforce
applications.
- Grip Security is a pioneer in SaaS identity risk management. It offers end-to-end visibility into the identity
life cycle across SaaS applications from discovery to offboarding, using identity as a focal point for
managing SaaS risks. Its user-focused, identity-centric approach enables the company to discover and
minimize risks on sanctioned and unsanctioned SaaS applications.

Frost Radar: SaaS Security Posture Management, 2024
21
Frost Radar Competitive Environment (continued)
- DoControl is known for supporting a wide range of SaaS security use cases, such as data access
governance, ITDR, identity risk management, shadow application governance, SaaS misconfiguration
management, data loss prevention, and insider risk management. However, the strength of its SSPM
solution lies in its multi-contextual analysis that identifies risky user behavior through SaaS events by
pulling metadata from sources such as endpoint detection and response (EDR), identity provider (IdP),
human resources information system (HRIS), and employee interactions.
- This allows DoControl to have a deeper insight into user activity so it can classify threats accurately and
ensure effective insider threat management. The company lags slightly on the Innovation Axis due to its
limited support for identity security, making it less favored in a market that increasingly looks to ensure
secure access to SaaS applications.
- Valence is well-positioned on the Innovation Axis thanks to its expertise in securing SaaS-to-SaaS
connections. Valence specializes in providing visibility and control: it continuously monitors the topology
of an organization’s SaaS ecosystem and tracks the movement of sensitive data between applications,
ensuring that their relationships and data flows remain protected and comply with regulatory standards.
- However, it has a narrow coverage for integration support. This may complicate an organization’s efforts
to have a full topology of its SaaS ecosystem if Valence does not support its SaaS applications.
- Check Point has broad SSPM capabilities designed to continuously analyze the behavior of SaaS
applications and SaaS-to-SaaS communications. It utilizes AI/ML to automate remediation actions. The
company’s solution can leverage insights from its other products, such as firewalls and email security,
which enriches its threat intelligence capability to identify risks effectively. However, it has paid little
attention to its SSPM following the acquisition, raising questions about the company’s strategy for this
solution.

PFQO-74
Source: Frost & Sullivan

Frost Radar: SaaS Security Posture Management, 2024
22
Frost Radar Competitive Environment (continued)
- Suridata has demonstrated its ability to innovate with the integration of SSPM and SSDR into its SaaS
Security Platform that addresses risks and misconfigurations. However, the company does not have a
strong focus on securing identities even though the market is heading towards an identity-first approach,
which may cause the company to lag behind the other players in this analysis.
- Varonis is well-known for its data security platform and its user behavior analytics capability to identify
abnormal behavior. The company takes a data-centric approach to SSPM, analyzing the data inside SaaS
applications to identify excessive permissions and perform automated remediation on excessive access.
Given that it focuses largely on the data, it provides a more niche focus than other players that
concentrate on securing the entire SaaS ecosystem.
- Spin.AI built a formidable reputation in backup and recovery and forayed into the SSPM market with
SpinSPM. A standout feature of its SSPM solution is its ability to continuously monitor and evaluate
browser extensions based on 15 attributes, including business operations and security aspects to
generate risk scores for every extension.
- A major weakness of Spin.AI, however, is its limited coverage for integrations because it only allows four
of the most popular SaaS applications. This has limited its ability to provide comprehensive protection,
particularly because many organizations continue to add new SaaS applications to their ecosystems.
- SecureSky and CheckRed Security forged a similar path in the SSPM market. Both companies have
SSPM as part of their flagship platform, CTEM for SecureSky and CNAPP for CheckRed. Both vendors
are still primarily recognized for their flagship platform’s business, affecting their perception in the SSPM
market.

INNOVATION
Adaptive Shield (CrowdStrike)
- Adaptive Shield's platform takes an identity-first approach to offer real-time visibility into the security of
business-critical SaaS applications. The centralized platform offers SaaS misconfiguration management,
identity protection, automated alerts and notifications, streamlined remediation, posture-over-time
monitoring, compliance checks, custom security checks, frameworks, rules and integrations,
customizations, integration with third-party ticketing systems and security tools, threat detection, and
automated workflows and playbooks. With the CrowdStrike acquisition, a unified platform will deliver
complete protection against identity-based attacks across hybrid cloud environments, from on-premises
active directory to cloud-based identity providers and SaaS apps.
- The comprehensive coverage of the SaaS ecosystem fueled by solid threat prevention, detection, and
response capabilities helps customers accurately detect and prioritize critical risks posed to their SaaS
environment. By supporting a breadth and depth of integrations with more than 150 SaaS applications,
and custom or home-grown applications, Adaptive Shield empowers organizations to leverage its
platform and address risks in SaaS security.
- Joining forces with CrowdStrike enables the company to mitigate device-to-SaaS risks by identifying
users with poor cyber hygiene on their devices, non-compliant devices, and unmanaged devices.
- In 2023 and 2024, Adaptive Shield released several technology enhancements as part of its broader
SaaS security strategy. This enhancement includes the expansion to more than 150 integrations with
SaaS applications, the Integration Builder to monitor additional and homegrown applications, ITDR
expansion, enhanced automated workflows and playbooks, shadow IT discovery, flexible reporting
engine, generative AI SaaS security, and improved SaaS entitlement management.

GROWTH
Adaptive Shield (CrowdStrike) (continued)
- Frost & Sullivan estimates that Adaptive Shield experienced a tremendous YoY growth of 101.7% in its
SSPM business in 2024, which led to a market share increase of 1% in 2024.
- The company operates in North America, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific. North America and EMEA were the
key revenue contributors, with a combined 83% share of its global SSPM business. The company has
expanded its market reach to Asia-Pacific and has yet to establish an active presence in Latin America.
To support its international operations, the company provides localized customer support, including
engineering, sales, customer success, and support teams in the United States, Japan, Australia, France,
the United Kingdom, Germany, and other countries. The acquisition by CrowdStrike will accelerate

FROST PERSPECTIVE
Adaptive Shield (CrowdStrike) (continued)
- Adaptive Shield is an Innovation leader on this Frost Radar because of its comprehensive SSPM
capabilities that bolster its broader flagship SaaS Security Platform, enabling the company to offer a
holistic security posture management and threat protection across the SaaS ecosystem.
- The company stands out in the market thanks to its large catalog of supported SaaS applications—which
currently stands at more than 150—while providing organizations with the option to integrate with any
custom or home-grown applications through its Integration Builder. Through its extensive support,
organizations can streamline their SaaS security management by monitoring and securing their entire
SaaS ecosystem using the company’s single platform. This allows security measures to scale easily as
organizations adopt new SaaS applications. In that context, the company should expand its coverage to
cover more industry-specific SaaS applications.
- The company’s device-to-SaaS risk management is a standout feature that identifies devices with poor
security and correlates the device’s health with the risks those devices pose to the organization’s broader
SaaS ecosystem. By correlating device health with user privileges, it enables organizations to implement
a zero-trust security model
