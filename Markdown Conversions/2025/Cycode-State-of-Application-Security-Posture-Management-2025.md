The State of ASPM:
Navigating Gen AI, the Code Boom, ASPM, \& Modern AppSec Challenges
Written by Lior Levy, CEO of Cycode, and
signed by Roland Cloutier, Former CSO at TikTok. 
Over 93 billion lines of code were generated in the past year 
alone, driven by the transformative rise of generative AI (GenAI)
and machine learning. This unprecedented "code boom" has not 
only reshaped the speed and scale of software development, 
but also created an unmanageable attack surface, leaving 
organizations struggling to keep up with the pace of innovation. 
And things arent slowing down. Gartner predicts that 80% of 
enterprises will embed AI deeply into their operations by 2026\. 
In an attempt to rise to these new challenges, many 
organizations are adding more and more tools to their security 
stack. Unfortunately, this tool sprawl has led to a new set of 
problems. Security teams are fatigued by alerts, false positives 
waste valuable time and resources, and critical threats can 
get lost amongst all the noise. These inefficiencies strain the 
relationship between security and development teams, eroding 
trust and hindering productivity. Developers are burdened with 
addressing non\-critical vulnerabilities, while real threats slip 
through the cracks. This not only increases risk, but also drives 
up costs due to tool ownership and inefficiencies. 
Thats where Application Security Posture Management 
(ASPM) comes in.
By providing comprehensive visibility, prioritization, and 
remediation, ASPM platforms stop application risk before it 
starts. The result? A reduced developer productivity tax and a 
lower total cost of ownership and overhead. 
Importantly, the evolution of ASPM has mirrored the changing 
needs of the industry.
The first wave of ASPM was largely focused on aggregation
tools that brought together security data but lacked context, 
leaving teams struggling to act on fragmented insights. The 
second wave emerged in response to crises like Log4J, which 
exposed the vulnerabilities of modern software supply chains. 
These solutions tackled the critical need for supply chain security 
but often failed to address deeper, systemic issues. 
Now, weve arrived at the third and most transformative wave: 
Complete ASPM. 
Complete ASPM combines proprietary scanning tools with 
seamless third\-party integrations and advanced capabilities 
like AI\-powered risk prioritization. By unifying these elements, 
Complete ASPM helps teams overcome AppSec Chaos once
and for all. 
Of course, AppSec is just one piece of a much larger 
cybersecurity puzzle. Some vendors offer tools that attempt to 
solve several challenges \- like code security and cloud security. 
While cloud and code security should certainly integrate, relying 
on a single solution to address both will result in inadequate 
protection and increased risks. Thats why a "separation of 
duties is essential: if businesses want to ensure that security 
is an enabler of innovation and not a bottleneck, leaders must 
look for best\-in\-class solutions with expertise in their respective 
domains. In the realm of code security, Cycode is that solution. 
We dont believe organizations should have to choose between 
innovation and security. Our mission is to enable companies to 
deliver safe code, fasterand adding yet another tool to your 
tech stack wont help you unlock speed, agility, or resilience. 
Businesses need a platform approach to help them embed 
security into every phase of development. 
Ready to step into the future of application security, where clarity 
replaces chaos and collaboration drives success?

The 2025 State of ASPM
Executive Summary
The 2025 State of ASPM Report marks the second annual 
study from Cycode, building on the industrys first ASPM 
report released last year.
This years findings provide a deeper look into the critical 
challenges and opportunities shaping application security 
as organizations grapple with growing attack surfaces, 
tool sprawl, and the rapid adoption of generative AI. 
One thing is clear: 2025 will be a turning point for 
application security practices.
Other key takeaways include:
GenAI is Exacerbating the Unmanageable Attack Surface: 
59% of security professionals agree that todays attack 
surface is unmanageable, with GenAI and code security 
emerging as the top blindspots. 
Budgets Are Growing, But Oversight is Lacking: Security 
budgets are expected to grow by an average of 50% in the 
next 12 months, but 77% of security professionals admit their 
organization lacks a full understanding of where their annual 
budget is being spent. This disconnect is largely driven by 
the proliferation of point solutions, which address narrow, 
niche problems but often add complexity and hidden costs. 
Tool Sprawl is Crippling AppSec Teams: Organizations use 
an average of 50 security tools, with 67% of respondents 
saying managing them is a significant hurdle. Across the 
board, tool sprawl is reducing visibility, creating blindspots, 
and limiting collaboration between security and developer 
teams.
2025 Will Be the Year of Code Security: 73% of security 
leaders believe code is everywhere, but 63% say CISOs 
arent investing enough in code security. At the same time 
security leaders are pushing for a separation of duties, with 
86% agreeing that ASPMs and CNAPPs are complementary 
solutions that shouldnt come together as one platform.
Cycode commissioned an independent, vendor\-
agnostic survey of 701 CISOs, AppSec Directors, 
and DevSecOps managers across the UK, US, and 
Germany, with 50% of respondents working within 
companies with 5,000\+ employees.

GenAI is Exacerbating the 
Unmanageable Attack Surface
The growing complexity of todays attack surface has 
left security professionals struggling to maintain control, 
with over half (59%) of respondents agreeing that todays 
attack surface is completely unmanageable.
This highlights the urgent need for organizations to 
rethink how they manage and secure their applications.

GenAI is partly to blame, with 70% of respondents saying 
GenAI has exacerbated existing visibility challenges.
"GenAI has exacerbated existing visibility challenges."
Thats because GenAI has enabled an unprecedented 
increase in code volume, much of it written by individuals 
without a deep understanding of secure architecture. 
At the same time, bad actors are leveraging the same 
technology to deploy more sophisticated and large\-scale 
attacks at unprecedented speed.
Its no wonder 72% of security leaders agree that the 
age of AI necessitates a complete overhaul in how 
organizations approach application security.

AppSec Chaos continues to prevent organizations from 
managing risks, fostering collaboration, and delivering 
secure software at scale. 
To address this challenge, 35% of organizations are 
allocating the lions share of their security budget to
the evaluation of security tools and technology. 
Tool Sprawl Continues 
to Fuel AppSec Chaos
But this approach has created unintended consequences. 
The average organization now uses 50 security tools 
across their security and development teams, an increase 
compared to last year.
Paradoxically, the research shows that the more tools a 
company has, and the larger its AppSec team, the more 
unmanageable its attack surface becomes. 
The challenge doesn't end there. Over two thirds (67%) 
of security professionals surveyed say that managing all 
of these tools is a significant hurdle, and 33% rank tool 
sprawl as their top application security concern. 
This highlights a critical disconnect: teams often assume 
that adding more tools will help them gain control over 
their attack surface, but in reality, tool proliferation is the 
root of many application security teams problems.

Top 3 Biggest Application Security Concerns
According to the data, visibility into security and risk 
posture is the top application security concern among 
security professionals.
This once again highlights the negative impact of tool 
sprawl, as outlined in Insight \#02\. Instead of improving 
visibility, an overload of tools often introduces additional 
complexity and chaos, making it harder for teams to gain 
a clear understanding of their risk posture.
These findings confirm that its time for organizations 
to rethink their approach to AppSec by consolidating 
all their point solutions into a single Complete ASPM 
platform.
Blindspots are Growing 
as Code Volume Surges
And when it comes to their biggest blindspots, GenAI 
has emerged as the \#1 blindspot reported by security 
professionals, followed by the exponential growth in 
code. These two challenges are deeply intertwined: as 
generative AI accelerates development, the attack surface 
expands, making it harder for teams to maintain visibility 
and respond effectively.

about the exponential increase in code. This figure climbs 
to almost three quarters (73%) of respondents with 81\-100

Security teams are pouring significant resources into tools 
and technology evaluation, with this area consistently 
topping the list of priorities for security budgets. 
This disconnect becomes even more pronounced in 
organizations with large tool stacks. Among respondents 
with fewer than 20 tools in use, 57% report budget 
visibility challenges. However, this figure skyrockets to 
90% among those with 61\-80 tools and 87% among those 
with 81\-100 tools. This highlights a troubling trend: the 
more tools an organization uses, the harder it becomes to 
track and justify spending.

"Code is everywhere,
securing code is vital"
63% 
3 out of 4 stated
According to nearly 3 in 4 (73%) of those surveyed, 
code is everywhere, and securing it across 
applications is vital. Clearly, security professionals 
would welcome greater investment in code security.
Encouragingly, security professionals surveyed expect 
their budgets to increase by an average of 50% over 
the next 12 months. This presents an opportunity to 
reprioritize investments and allocate more resources 
toward securing code.
But code security demands expertise. While we 
advocate for a platform approach that reduces 
tool sprawl and complexity, its essential not to 
consolidate tools to the point where organizations are 
left with sub\-par solutions. Code security is too critical 
to be handled by generic platformsit requires 
specialized expertise, and Cycode is the leader in this 
domain.
Security leaders seem to agree. Despite recent 
announcements from some vendors, 86% of 
respondents believe that ASPMs and CNAPPs are 
complementary solutions that shouldnt come 
together as one platform. This separation of duties 
ensures that teams can deploy best\-in\-class tools 
for each domain while maintaining the flexibility to 
integrate with other parts of their security ecosystem.

Its no secret that security teams have, for a long time, 
faced a problem with a technical skills gap.
According to research carried out by the World Economic 
Forum, there is currently a shortage of around 4 million 
cyber professionals, with 71% of organizations stating 
that they have unfilled cybersecurity positions.
Unfortunately, this is hindering progress for many of the 
security professionals. In fact, 39% of respondents said 
that a shortage of staff to implement new solutions is one 
of the main things holding them back from adopting new 
AppSec solutions.

greater sense of urgency to their efforts. However, keeping 
up with the ever\-evolving landscape of compliance 
requirements is becoming increasingly challenging.

region, come into effect in 2025, further complicating 
the regulatory landscape. Similarly, in the United States, 
FedRAMP compliance requirements continue to evolve, 
placing increasing pressure on organizations working with 
government agencies to meet stringent cloud security 
standards.
Unfortunately, over half of respondents (56%) report 
that maintaining compliance is becoming more and more 
difficult. One major reason is that compliance remains a 
manual and time\-consuming process, as highlighted by 
another 56% of security professionals surveyed.
Surprisingly, organizations with larger tool stacks61 or 
more toolsare even more likely to say compliance is a 
manual process than those with fewer tools. This suggests 
that their existing tools arent fit for purpose when it 
comes to simplifying compliance workflows. Instead of 
reducing complexity, these bloated stacks often add to it.
