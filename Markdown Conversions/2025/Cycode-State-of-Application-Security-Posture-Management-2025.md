challenges and opportunities shaping application security 

as organizations grapple with growing attack surfaces, 

tool sprawl, and the rapid adoption of generative AI. 

One thing is clear: 2025 will be a turning point for 

application security practices.

Other key takeaways include:

GenAI is Exacerbating the Unmanageable Attack Surface: 

59% of security professionals agree that today’s attack 

surface is unmanageable, with GenAI and code security 

emerging as the top blindspots. 

Budgets Are Growing, But Oversight is Lacking: Security 

budgets are expected to grow by an average of 50% in the 

next 12 months, but 77% of security professionals admit their 

organization lacks a full understanding of where their annual 

budget is being spent. This disconnect is largely driven by 

the proliferation of point solutions, which address narrow, 

niche problems but often add complexity and hidden costs. 

Tool Sprawl is Crippling AppSec Teams: Organizations use 

an average of 50 security tools, with 67% of respondents 

saying managing them is a significant hurdle. Across the 

board, tool sprawl is reducing visibility, creating blindspots, 

and limiting collaboration between security and developer 

teams.

2025 Will Be the Year of Code Security: 73% of security 

leaders believe “code is everywhere”, but 63% say CISOs 

aren’t investing enough in code security. At the same time 

security leaders are pushing for a separation of duties, with

Tool Sprawl Continues

AppSec Chaos continues to prevent organizations from

secure software at scale. 

To address this challenge, 35% of organizations are

The challenge doesn't end there. Over two thirds (67%)

of these tools is a significant hurdle, and 33% rank tool 

sprawl as their top application security concern. 

This highlights a critical disconnect: teams often assume 

that adding more tools will help them gain control over

And when it comes to their biggest blindspots, GenAI 

has emerged as the \#1 blindspot reported by security 

professionals, followed by the exponential growth in 

code. These two challenges are deeply intertwined: as 

generative AI accelerates development, the attack surface 

expands, making it harder for teams to maintain visibility 

and respond effectively.

visibility, an overload of tools often introduces additional 

complexity and chaos, making it harder for teams to gain 

a clear understanding of their risk posture.

to rethink their approach to AppSec by consolidating

Securing Code Must 
Be a Priority in 2025

63% of respondents believe CISOs aren’t investing 

enough in code security, even though it’s a critical 

foundation for protecting applications. However, with the 

exponential increase in code creating more risk than ever, 

this will need to change in 2025\.

But code security demands expertise. While we

tool sprawl and complexity, it’s essential not to

left with sub\-par solutions. Code security is too critical 

to be handled by generic platforms—it requires 

specialized expertise, and Cycode is the leader in this 

domain.

Surprisingly, organizations with larger tool stacks—61 or 

more tools—are even more likely to say compliance is a 

manual process than those with fewer tools. This suggests 

that their existing tools aren’t fit for purpose when it 

comes to simplifying compliance workflows. Instead of 

reducing complexity, these bloated stacks often add to it.

59%

As just one example of new regulations, operational 

mandates from the Digital Operational Resilience Act 

(DORA), which applies to financial institutions in the EMEA 

region, come into effect in 2025, further complicating 

the regulatory landscape. Similarly, in the United States, 

FedRAMP compliance requirements continue to evolve, 

placing increasing pressure on organizations working with 

government agencies to meet stringent cloud security 

standards.

Unfortunately, over half of respondents (56%) report 

that maintaining compliance is becoming more and more
