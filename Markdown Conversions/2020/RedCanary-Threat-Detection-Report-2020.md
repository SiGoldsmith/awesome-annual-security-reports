2020 Threat Detection Report

Welcome to the 2020 Threat 
Detection Report

This in-depth look at the most prevalent ATT&CK® techniques is designed to help you and your team focus on what 
matters most.

Welcome to Red Canary’s 2020 Threat Detection Report. Based on in-depth analysis of tens of thousands of threats 
detected across our customers’ environments, this research arms security leaders and their teams with a unique 
understanding of the threats they’re facing.

We’ve leveraged the common language of MITRE ATT&CK to categorize confirmed threats, but our analysis focuses on 
providing a comprehensive view of adversary techniques that are most likely to occur in your environment. You’ll find 
unique intelligence to inform your thinking, help you prioritize investments, and educate your team on how to detect and 
shut down adversaries.

Year-over-year trending

Last year’s inaugural report summarized all such 
data available across Red Canary’s entire history. 
This year’s report focuses on the more than 
15,000 threats we detected between January 
and December 2019, comparing them to threats 
detected over the same period in the prior year.

Additional research

Our threat rankings are determined entirely by 
detection volume. As a result, a sizable outbreak 
in one environment can have a disproportionate 
impact on our entire dataset. To combat that, we’ve 
included analysis on supplemental techniques that 
are outside the top 10 but affected many customers.

Common co-occurrences

ATT&CK techniques do not occur in isolation, so it is 
important to understand how adversaries leverage 
multiple techniques to accomplish their goals. This 
year’s report identifies ATT&CK techniques that are 
used in concert by adversaries and their tools.

Actionable insights

Each technique section includes detailed guidance 
on data sources security teams can use to observe 
related threats. We also provide specific telemetry 
patterns that are useful for detecting threats, as well 
as those that are prone to false positives.

2020 Threat Detection Report

The report excludes low-severity detection of unwanted software, such as adware. We’ve tagged each confirmed threat 
with corresponding ATT&CK technique(s) based on the logic used to identify the threat.

Since 2013, Red Canary has delivered high-quality threat detection to organizations of all sizes. Our platform collects 
hundreds of terabytes of endpoint telemetry every day, surfacing evidence of threats that are analyzed by our Cyber 
Incident Response Team (CIRT). Confirmed threats are tied to corresponding ATT&CK techniques so that our customers 
clearly understand what is happening in their environments. This report is a summary of confirmed threats derived from 
this data.

How to use the report:

•	Start looking through the most prevalent techniques to see what we’ve observed in our customers’ environments
•	Explore how to detect and mitigate specific techniques, with ideas and recommendations from our 
detection engineers
•	Talk with your team about how the ideas, recommendations, and priorities fit in with your environment

# #1 T1055 Process Injection

Process Injection was the most common threat we observed in our customers’ environments in 2019, largely because 
TrickBot uses the technique to run arbitrary code through the Windows Service Host (svchost.exe).

Why do adversaries use Process Injection?

Process Injection tops our list as the most common ATT&CK technique across our customer base due to a very specific 
threat: TrickBot. However, the technique is actually quite versatile, facilitating a range of actions as broad as nearly any 
other ATT&CK technique. Categorized under both Defense Evasion and Privilege Escalation, Process Injection is arguably 
an Execution technique as well.

Process Injection is a technique whereby an adversary is able to carry out some nefarious activity in the context of a 
legitimate process. In this way, malicious activity—whether it’s an overtly malicious binary or a process that’s been co-
opted as such—blends in with routine operating system processes.

Stealth, however, is just one of the benefits of Process Injection. Its most useful function may be that arbitrary code, once 
injected into a legitimate process, can inherit the privileges of that process or, similarly, access parts of the operating 
system that shouldn’t be otherwise available.

Process Injection rose to the top of our 
rankings due to widespread TrickBot and 
Emotet outbreaks in late 2018 that continued 
through 2019.

How do adversaries use Process Injection?

In the environments we monitor, the vast majority of Process Injection activity results from TrickBot infections. 
Specifically, TrickBot launches svchost.exe and then uses Process Injection to carry out malicious activity.

Some other common variations of Process Injection include: 
•	Remotely injecting code libraries into running processes
•	Using seemingly benign processes such as notepad.exe to make external network connections and later injecting 
code that performs malicious actions
•	Leveraging Microsoft Office applications to create RemoteThread injections into dllhost.exe for the purposes of 
conducting attacks with malicious macros
•	Cross-process injection initiated by lsass.exe into taskhost.exe
•	Metasploit injecting itself into processes such as svchost.exe to avoid suspicion and increase stability
•	Injecting code into a browser process to enable snooping on a user’s browsing session, which is a common 
characteristic of banking and other credential-stealing trojans

In addition to TrickBot, we have also seen the following malware families carry out Process Injection:
•	PlugX
•	Dridex
•	Emotet
•	AgentTesla
•	Hancitor
•	Ursnif/Dreambot

Sighted with

We most commonly see Process Injection occurring in tandem with Scheduled Tasks (T1053) across our customer base 
because TrickBot sometimes uses Scheduled Tasks for persistence.

We also often see Process Injection paired with Remote File Copy (T1105) and Windows Admin Shares (T1077). Code 
injected into TrickBot downloads additional libraries for execution, explaining its occurrence with Remote File Copy,

while TrickBot and common follow-on trojan Emotet use Windows Admin Shares to move laterally on an infected network.

Far less often we see Process Injection alongside Uncommonly Used Port (T1509)—likely because code injected by TrickBot 
may communicate on tcp/447 and tcp/449 for command and control—and Mshta (T1170). The latter is the result of newer 
.NET exploitation tools such as DotNetToJScript and CACTUSTORCH that allow attackers to inject code from 
HTML Applications.

Process Injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running 
code in the context of another process may allow access to the process’s memory, system/network resources, and 
possibly elevated privileges. Execution via Process Injection may also evade detection from security products since the 
execution is masked under a legitimate process.

Collection requirements

Process monitoring

Process monitoring is a minimum requirement for reliably detecting Process Injection. Even though injection can be 
invisible to some forms of process monitoring, the effects of the injection can become harder to miss once you compare 
process behaviors against expected functionality.

API monitoring

If possible, monitor API system calls that include CreateRemoteThread in Windows. This will indicate a process is using 
the Windows API to inject code into another process. Security teams should monitor for the ptrace system calls on Linux 
as well.

Detection suggestions

The detection of Process Injection involves hunting for legitimate processes doing unexpected things. This may involve 
processes making external network connections and writing files, or it may involve processes spawning with unexpected 
command-line arguments.

Some good examples of odd behavior within a process include:

Some good examples of odd paths or command lines that may indicate injection:
•	Svchost.exe making network connections on tcp/447 and tcp/449
•	Notepad.exe making external network connections
•	Mshta.exe calling CreateRemoteThread to inject code
•	Rundll32.exe, regasm.exe, regsvr32.exe, regsvcs.exe, svchost.exe, and werfault.exe process executions without 
command-line options may indicate they are targets of process injection.
•	Microsoft processes such as vbc.exe with command lines including /scomma, /shtml, or /stext may indicate the 
injection of Nirsoft tools for credential access.
•	Linux processes with memfd: in their path indicate they were spawned from code injected into another process.

Specific to TrickBot, we have two behavioral analytics that look for untrusted processes launching svchost.exe. Collectively, 
these two analytics—on their own and in tandem—uncovered more than 4,200 confirmed threats. A third analytic looks for a 
mix of svchost.exe injection and network connections. It converted into a confirmed threat nearly 2,500 times.

In addition, adversaries may modify some files or environment variables on macOS and Linux systems to signal intent for 
Process Injection:
•	On macOS, modifying the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable may allow injection.
•	On Linux systems, modifying the /etc/ld.so.preload file or the environment variables LD_PRELOAD or 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH may allow injection.

2020 Threat Detection Report

11

Weeding out false positives

The analytics that produced the most false positives came from looking for CreateRemoteThread calls from any and all 
processes. Many tools in Windows use Process Injection legitimately for debugging and virtualization. If you want to write 
analytics around this API call, focus them on unusual source processes, such as Microsoft Office products and tools that 
commonly deliver first-stage malware like scripts and Mshta.

Testing

Start testing your defenses against Process Injection using Atomic Red Team—an open source testing framework of small, 
highly portable detection tests mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.

Getting started

View Atomic tests for T1055: Process Injection. In most environments, these should be sufficient to generate a useful 
signal for defenders.

# #2 T1053 Scheduled Task

Scheduled Task is another technique that owes its prominence largely to TrickBot, which schedules tasks to launch 
malicious binaries and persist on host machines.

Why do adversaries use Scheduled Tasks?

Scheduled Tasks allow adversaries to carry out certain actions at pre-specified times, enabling execution, persistence, 
and privilege escalation. Like many of the techniques analyzed in this report, Scheduled Tasks are a functionally necessary 
component of the Windows operating system. They execute routinely, and malicious tasks readily blend in with benign 
ones.

Scheduled Tasks represent a versatile tool for adversaries. With the requisite privileges, an attacker can schedule tasks 
remotely. The technique is also useful for execution and persistence in conjunction with a variety of widely used scripting 
languages, such as PowerShell.

With an increase in the percentage of customers 
affected and a decrease in percentage of total 
threat volume, Scheduled Task was the second 
most prevalent threat in both 2018 and 2019.

How do adversaries use Scheduled Tasks?

Adversaries create Scheduled Tasks to run scripts, execute processes, or persist on endpoints to execute later.

Behaviors we frequently observe include:
•	Adware updating itself by using Scheduled Tasks to launch unsigned binaries from AppData
•	Malware using the Task Scheduler Engine (taskeng.exe) to launch a malicious binary that then executes the 
Service Host process (svchost.exe)
•	Scheduled Tasks executing PowerShell payloads for persistent access

The above behaviors triggered thousands of detections across our customer base and are common characteristics of 
adware, TrickBot, and QBot infections, respectively.

While TrickBot and Emotet influence the prominence of Scheduled Tasks in our detection data, adversaries of every 
sophistication level—from adware peddlers to national intelligence agencies—rely on Scheduled Tasks.

Sighted with

Scheduled Tasks very commonly occur alongside:
•	Masquerading (T1036)
•	Process Injection (T1055)
•	Disabling Security Tools (T1089)
•	Domain Trust Discovery (T1482)
•	Remote File Copy (T1105)
•	Windows Admin Shares (T1077)

With the possible exception of Masquerading, TrickBot commonly leverages each of these techniques.

T 1 0 5 3 :  S C H E D U L E D  T A S K

Utilities such as at and schtasks, along with the Windows Task Scheduler, can be used to schedule programs or scripts to 
be executed at a date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is 
met to use RPC and file and printer sharing is turned on. Scheduling a task on a remote system typically required being a 
member of the Administrators group on the remote system. An adversary may use task scheduling to execute programs 
at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence, to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to 
gain SYSTEM privileges, or to run a process under the context of a specified account.

MITRE’s data sources

2020 Threat Detection Report

16

Collection requirements

API monitoring

API monitoring is an additional data source that is useful in certain contexts for observing adversaries leveraging Scheduled 
Task. In some attack campaigns, adversaries have used the Windows Component Object Model and Distributed COM 
technique (T1175) to create a Scheduled Task via macros or other methods. API monitoring provides visibility into this and 
other covert methods for creating a Scheduled Task.

File monitoring

File monitoring provides a useful data source for observing the malicious use of Scheduled Tasks. Defenders should 
consider tracking the schtasks.exe or at.exe binary because it will enable them to continue observing Scheduled Tasks, 
even if the binary has been moved to a different path or renamed entirely. A Scheduled Task that has been moved or 
renamed can be a good indicator of malice.

Process monitoring

Monitoring process execution of schtasks.exe and at.exe is important because these processes have the ability to set tasks 
locally or remotely, enabling lateral movement. Historically, adversaries have set Scheduled Tasks to start under a different 
user context (administrator, for example).

More recently, PowerShell has a cmdlet (new-ScheduledTask) that provides the same functionality as schtasks.exe. 
Understanding the processes that normally spawn Scheduled Tasks and monitoring parent-child process relationships is 
useful for observation as well.

Process command-line parameters

Process command-line parameters are another rich source for observing malicious Scheduled Tasks. While they might 
provide the highest fidelity of alerting, they also offer adversaries the most potential for blending in. Understanding the 
various parameters and what to look for in a given environment requires extensive research and testing, but tracking via 
the command-line is ultimately the way that most teams monitor for Scheduled Task abuse.

Windows event logs

Windows event logs may also provide useful information about start and stop times for task execution, as well as additional 
details about the task itself.

2020 Threat Detection Report

17

Detection suggestions

Security teams should begin by reviewing all process and command-line execution of schtasks.exe and at.exe, ranking the 
results from most common to least. Where possible, you should also try to collect all Scheduled Tasks across an environment 
using a tool such as OSQuery or Sysinternals Autoruns. Again, you’ll want to organize the associated processes and command-
lines by occurrence, so that you understand which tasks occur often and which do not.

You’ll want to take a close look at less commonly used command-line switches for schtasks.exe. One example might be /XML. 
It’s entirely possible that searching for this in your environment may turn up nothing, but if you do happen to find it, you’ll 
want to examine the contents of that XML file.

It’s also a good idea to monitor for tasks that spawn at seemingly strange intervals. For example, something like /sc minute 
/mo 20, which means that the task will run every 20 minutes, should be viewed with suspicion. There are few legitimate 
reasons that a task would need to run every 20 minutes—or at any other fixed interval.

Tracking for Scheduled Tasks that load binaries (.exe, for example) or scripts (.ps1, .vbe, and .vbs to name a few) from 
suspicious paths is a quick win for detection. The default execution path for schtasks.exe or at.exe is c:\windows\system32\ 
and c:\windows\syswow64\, so any deviation from those should raise concerns that the binary has been moved. Also 
consider monitoring for suspicious execution paths such as \appdata\ and \windows\tasks\, as it is pretty suspicious for a 
Scheduled Task to execute from either of these paths.

As is the case with Masquerading, you should review binary metadata. Binary metadata includes a field for internal names, 
which are often good indicators of a binary’s true identity. It’s a good idea to raise an alert when it appears that schtasks.exe or 
at.exe have been renamed.

Ultimately, you’ll want to understand what parent processes normally spawn Scheduled Tasks. Is it normal in your 
environment for SYSTEM to create a task? If the answer is “no,” then you’ll want to consider alerting on that behavior. 
Similarly, you may want to track when users spawn schtasks.exe from PowerShell or cmd.exe.

Weeding out false positives

We should note that tracking schtasks.exe command-line parameters may generate a high volume of data and false positives 
at first. By default, Windows runs a number of common tasks. The same is essentially true at the organizational level, with 
application and server-specific tasks. Once you identify and tune out the normal, deviations are pretty reliable indicators of 
maliciousness.

Some automated software deployment utilities (e.g., SCCM, Kaseya) may utilize Scheduled Tasks to deploy software or keep 
systems up to date—and may contribute to high false positive rates.

# #3 T1077 Windows Admin Shares

Self-propagating threats—most notably those that leverage ETERNALBLUE—contributed to the rise of Windows Admin 
Shares among confirmed threats in the environments we monitor.

Why do adversaries use Windows Admin Shares?

Windows Admin Shares are enabled by default on most Windows systems, and administrators regularly use them to 
conduct remote host management. Since Windows Admin Share activity is so common, it provides adversaries with a 
powerful, discreet way to move laterally within an environment. Self-propagating ransomware and cryptocurrency miners, 
both rapidly emerging threats, rely on Windows Admin Shares.

Many popular lateral movement and execution tools leverage Windows Admin Shares, including:
•	PsExec
•	RemCom
•	CSExec
•	PAExec
•	Impacket wmiexec

Windows Admin Shares experienced a dramatic 
shift in prevalence from 2018 to 2019, climbing 
from 10 to three and almost quintupling in 
threat volume.

How do adversaries use Windows Admin Shares?

Adversaries commonly use administrative tools such as PsExec (and the various clones of it) to deploy malware from 
one machine to another. Admin shares can also be used to store the output of commands for easy access.

The rise of ETERNALBLUE—a prominent, publicly available exploit for a vulnerability in the Windows server message 
block (SMB) protocol—is a major factor in increased detection of Windows Admin Shares and related activity. To that 
point, many of our ETERNALBLUE-related analytics map partially to Windows Admin Shares and alert on threats 
such as:
•	WannaCry
•	TrickBot
•	Several cryptocurrency miners
•	Metasploit
•	Cobalt Strike
•	Other post-exploitation frameworks that use Impacket wmiexec
•	Red teams

Sighted with

Windows Admin Shares are often used in conjunction with behaviors relating to Remote File Copy (T1105)—because 
adversaries commonly use the technique to remotely copy files—and Network Share Discovery (T1135). It can also occur 
with New Service (T1050) and Service Execution (T1035) because PsExec deploys its receiver executable to admin shares, 
scheduling a service to execute it.

Windows systems have hidden network shares that are accessible only to administrators and provide the ability for 
remote file copy and other administrative functions. Example network shares include C$, ADMIN$, and IPC$. Adversaries 
may use this technique in conjunction with administrator-level Valid Accounts to remotely access a networked system 
over server message block (SMB) to interact with systems using remote procedure calls (RPCs), transfer files, and run 
transferred binaries through remote Execution. Example execution techniques that rely on authenticated sessions over 
SMB/RPC are Scheduled Task, Service Execution, and Windows Management Instrumentation. Adversaries can also use 
NTLM hashes to access administrator shares on systems with Pass the Hash and certain configuration and patch levels. 
The Net utility can be used to connect to Windows admin shares on remote systems using net use commands with valid 
credentials.
