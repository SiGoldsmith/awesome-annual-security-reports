Executive Summary

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is analyzed information about the capabilities, 

opportunities and intent of adversaries that meets a specific requirement determined 

by a stakeholder. Organizations with CTI 

programs focus on understanding the threats 

TAKEAWAYS

they face and providing specific information 

to help defend against those threats. In 

the past few years, CTI has evolved from 

small, ad\-hoc tasks performed disparately 

across an organization to, in many cases, 

robust programs with their own staff, tools 

and processes that support the entire 

organization. 2020 was a big year for the 

SANS CTI Survey, with a record number of 

respondents and the highest ever reporting of 

CTI programs within organizations, with 1,006 

responding to the survey in 2020 and just 505 

responding in 2019\.1 Some areas leveled out 

after years of growth—such as implementation 

of threat intelligence platforms and a focus 

on tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) 

over just indicators of compromise (IoCs)—and 

some areas continued to grow both in number 

and variety, such as the types of data being 

used to generate intelligence. As the field 

settles into its new maturity, understanding 

and improving the effectiveness of CTI 

programs will become even more critical. 

With that in mind, SANS asked respondents 

• Collaboration is key. While the number of organizations with dedicated 
threat intelligence teams is growing, we continue to see an emphasis 
on partnering with others, whether through a paid service provider 
relationship or through information\-sharing groups or programs. In addition, 
collaboration within organizations is also on the rise, with many respondents 
reporting that their CTI teams are part of a coordinated effort across the 
organization. 

• Not all processes require the same level of automation. Semi\-automation 

may be the gold standard when it comes to data processing, even for some 
tasks that are often considered redundant, such as data deduplication, 
because such information is sometimes useful to analysts.

• The necessary data and tools change as CTI teams evolve. As more 

organizations begin to produce their own intelligence, the nature of 
information that CTI analysts require is also shifting from primarily threat\-
feed or vendor\-provided information to data from internal tools and teams. 
While many of the same tools and processes can be used to handle this type 
of information, organizations also must determine how this changes their 
need for tools handling this data. 

• Requirements are taking hold and are a staple of mature teams. 

Requirements are a key part of the intelligence process and help to ensure 
a focus on collection and analysis efforts by analysts as well as proper 
production of intelligence. This makes the intelligence process more 
efficient, effective and measurable—keys to long\-term success. Last year, 
a minority of organizations reported that they had clearly defined and 
documented intelligence requirements, which was highlighted as a key 
recommendation for organizations. This year, nearly half of respondents 
answered that they have defined and documented intelligence requirements. 
This is a fantastic jump in the data and is an encouragement to anyone who 
is seeking to add defined and documented intelligence requirements into 
their CTI program.

to weigh in on how their programs measure 

• A community of consumers and producers contribute to CTI. More 

effectiveness, an area that CTI programs must 

continue to improve on in the coming years. 

organizations consume intelligence than produce it (as we would expect), 
but more than 40% of respondents both produce and consume intelligence. 
This is a great indicator of the growing maturity and professionalization 
of the cyber threat intelligence field. Organizations that have trouble 
satisfying a majority of their intelligence requirements—because they are 
only consuming intelligence or are missing any of their priority intelligence 
requirements—should consider moving to both generating and consuming 
intelligence. Those considering generating cyber threat intelligence should 
review the SANS CTI Summit videos2 on the topic and/or attend a CTI course.3

CTI Programs: The Right People and the Right Tools

Cyber Threat Intelligence involves analyzing information about threats and producing 

guidance to determine what steps must be taken in response to those threats. This 

process, which by now seems intuitive in concept, is incredibly complex and relies on a 

combination of people, processes and tools to both generate, consume and act on the 

intelligence. All three things are critical to a successful CTI program. Without personnel 

to evaluate information and make analytic judgements, there would be no CTI. Likewise, 

without processes and tools, even the best analysts will find themselves severely limited 

in the amount of data they can turn into actionable intelligence compared with the 

volume of threats their organizations potentially face. While the 2020 CTI Survey results 

show some promising improvements in these critical areas, they also highlight places 

where the community would benefit from continued efforts.

People

People are often considered the core of a CTI program. Not only do they conduct the 

analysis that will lead to finished intelligence, but they also decide what tools and 

processes to use to support their efforts. A single analyst can be successful with 

the right tools and support from other security teams; however, respondents have 

historically reported the difficulty that these lone individuals face when trying to keep 

up with the sheer volume of tasks. In the past three years, we have seen an increase 

in the percentage of respondents choosing to have a dedicated team over a single 

individual responsible for the entire 

CTI program. According to the 2020 

CTI Survey results, almost half of all 

respondents report that they have a 

dedicated team, which is especially 

encouraging because it means those

Another way to address the need 

for skilled analysts is to work with

support an organization’s CTI functionality. In the past year, more organizations have 

chosen to partner with external resources, with 61% of respondents reporting that CTI 

tasks are handled by a combination of in\-house and service provider teams, up from 
54% in 2019\.4 The number of teams relying solely on service providers has remained 
relatively consistent, with 8% in 2019 and 7% in 2020\. 

Some respondents provided additional insight into the collaboration supporting their 

organization’s CTI programs, for example the handling of network defense in\-house, 

indicating that other CTI tasks such as data collection and providing threat assessments 

might be handled by external partners. One respondent reported that while their 

primary role is a threat intelligence service provider who supported other organizations, 

they still have relationships with external partners of their 

own. In some situations, an organization is limited in the 

amount of information it can share with external partners, 

such as with some government\-sector respondents, but 

even in those cases, relationships with external partners 

can still be beneficial by providing insight into what other

These skills are all extremely useful to an organization’s threat intelligence capabilities, 

as both incident triage and in\-depth IR of internal events are critical to understanding 

the threats that an organization faces. In the past, we have seen similar numbers of 

SOC and IR resources as part of CTI teams; however this year’s respondents reported 

having a higher number of dedicated threat intelligence analysts as part of their teams. 

Respondents also indicated a high level of cross\-functional collaboration between 

security teams in their organizations, writing that their CTI team is part of a “purple 

team” or a “fusion cell” focusing on security. In addition, some of the responses make it 

clear that there is not, and will likely never be, a one\-size\-fits\-all 

approach to CTI teams, adding their own categories of personnel 

including finance, digital crimes and security strategy teams. 

This year’s survey responses are very promising for the 

continued evolution of CTI as a critical security function. 

Not only were there more people responding to the survey 

in general, but respondents are reporting more personnel

dedicated to CTI functions while maintaining and even improving collaboration 

with both internal and external teams. With more people and more teams working 

collaboratively, it is even more important to have the right processes and tools in place 

to support CTI efforts. 

CTI Tools

Threat intelligence is the result of the aggregation and analysis of data related to the 

intent, opportunity and capabilities of adversaries. Getting the right data to the right 

places for analysis is crucial to the process. While there will always be some level of 

human analysis in the overall intelligence process, the goal is to allow CTI analysts to 

spend their time on the things requiring their expert judgment, and take the manual 

work out of the processes that don’t. This year, we saw a small decrease in the number 

of respondents reporting manual efforts in some key areas, but there was still a fair 

amount of “sad\-face emojis” in the comments when asked about manual processes. 

For the survey, we have broken CTI tools into two functional groupings: tools for 

processing data and turning it into intelligence, and tools for managing intelligence 

including generating alerts based on intelligence. 

Processing Tools 

Data must be processed before it can be analyzed and turned into intelligence. 

Processing includes repeatable tasks such as deduplication of data, data enrichment 

and data standardization, along with other more intensive tasks requiring analysis 

of their own, such as reverse engineering of malware. Most organizations report that 

processing is either a manual or semi\-automated process. Deduplication is the most 

commonly automated process, with only 27% of organizations reporting manual 

deduplication of data. Reverse engineering of samples is the least automated process, 

with 48% reporting manual efforts for this task, up slightly from last year. This trend is 

evident with regard to management tools, where forensics platforms have the second 

lowest level of automation and the highest level of disparate use, meaning that when 

they are used in a CTI function analysts must manually initiate the transfer of data or 

manually input data from one system to another. 

2020 SANS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Survey

Respondents did not report a high level of change in processing capabilities 

between 2019 and 2020\. The majority of processing tasks are done either manually 

or are semi\-automated. One area where we saw automation improvement in is the 

enrichment of data. Manual enrichment of information using internal data sources 

is down by 5% balanced by a slight increase in semi\-automated and fully automated 

processes. Enrichment of information using external public data sources and using 

semi\-automated methods increased by 5% from 2019\. Interestingly, reporting of fully 

automated processing remained the same or decreased slightly with the exception of 

enrichment of internal data, suggesting an interesting concept in an industry where 

complete automation is often the end goal. Because data processing is such a critical 

step in the analytic process, it appears that analysts are reluctant to trust this step 

entirely to automated processes, staying true to somewhat ironic phrase “trust but 

verify.” Streamlining the verification process might result in more semi\-automated 

processes versus fully automated processes, but may be just what analysts need to 

support their work. 

Management Tools

In the 2020 CTI Survey, respondents report that Security Information and Event 

Management (SIEM) platforms, network traffic monitoring tools and intrusion monitoring 

platforms are the most heavily used tools. Of this, SIEM platforms have the highest 

reported level of use (86\.9%) as well as the highest use of automation. Most other 

management tools, including network traffic monitoring, intrusion analysis and 

forensics platforms are reported as having some automation, with the exception of 

spreadsheets and emails, which are mostly processed manually. Despite the lack of 

automated or semi\-automated processes, spreadsheets and emails remain one of the 

top management tools for CTI analysts. See Figure 4\.

Over the years, respondents have consistently listed spreadsheets as a CTI tool for both 

management and processing. In addition to allowing data to be stored and shared, 

many spreadsheet applications have built\-in functionality that supports processing 

such as sorting, deduplication and converting 

the data into various visual formats. Many 

dedicated CTI tool developers understand 

that spreadsheets are familiar and functional 

for analysts and have built them into their 

own processes. Most data in CTI tools can 

be exported and imported into .csv format, 

and some SIEM tools allow users to build 

automated tasks around data in spreadsheets. 

These additions will help overcome some 

of the shortcomings of working with 

spreadsheets, such as getting consistent 

data to different users within the same team, 

which is even more important now that there 

are more dedicated CTI teams as opposed to 

standalone analysts. 

TAKEAWAYS

• More organizations are investing in dedicated CTI teams versus individual 

analysts or fully outsourced functionalities. These teams will enable 
organizations to better understand and address the threats they face. Many 
organizations just beginning to build out their teams still need to focus not 
only on training of CTI skills, but also on collaboration and teamwork skills to 
work with internal and external partners, which are critical for a CTI team. 

• We see less full automation and more semi\-automation in CTI processing 

tools. While we see more automation in the management of CTI, especially 
when it comes to the use of tools such as SIEMs and network management 
tools, respondents report less full automation and more semi\-automation 
in CTI processing tools. While manual processes are often a hindrance to 
analysis, semi\-automation may be the most beneficial for analysts, taking 
away some of the most tedious aspects of a task, but still providing analysts 
with a level of control and transparency that gives them confidence in their 
processes. 

CTI Processes: The Intelligence Cycle

The CTI community and many organizations both produce and consume intelligence. 

Over the years, more and more organizations report that they are producing and 

consuming data, with a 10% increase from 2019 in those that both produce and consume 

raw threat data and a nearly 7% increase in those who both produce and consume 

alerts with contextual data as well as published threat reports. Of the three categories 

of CTI, we see only published threat intelligence with 

more sole consumers, with 55% consuming this type 

of intelligence without producing it (see Figure 5\). 

Regardless of whether an organization produces 

and/or consumes intelligence, a process is required 

60%

to move from identification of what questions must 

be answered using threat intelligence to actions 

benefitting an organization’s defenses. For many 

40%

organizations, that process is a version of the classic 

intelligence cycle. 

The intelligence cycle is a process for generating 

accurate, useable intelligence. It begins with 

a planning phase, in which the intelligence 

questions that must be answered (also known 

as “requirements”) are generated. When the

requirements are known, the next phase is collection, 

gathering data to help answer the questions and meet 

the requirements. The next phase is processing, where 

the data is put into a usable format for analysis. This 

leads into the fourth phase, analysis, in which the data 

is synthesized to identify the answers to the intelligence 

requirements. The last phase is dissemination, where 

the findings are captured in the right format to reach 

the intended audience outlined in the planning phase. 

It is important to note that while the intelligence 

cycle is a cyclical process, it is sometimes necessary 

to go backward in the process; for example if, during 

the analysis phase it is determined that additional 

information is needed or information must be 

processed in a different format, it is important to go 

back to the appropriate earlier step so that the end 

result is an informed, accurate analytic finding. See

Respondents report that requirements are primarily updated in an ad hoc manner 

rather than on a scheduled (yearly, monthly or weekly) basis. But the good news is that 

only 5% of respondents say they don’t update requirements at 

all (see Figure 8\). While there are some consistent themes in 

requirements across the board, many are unique to a specific 

organization or are based on past incidents or upcoming 

significant events for the organization.

comes to consuming intelligence, timeliness and relevance are once again at the top of 

the list of important factors, but more and more respondents are considering how that 

information will be consumed as well as the content. This year, several respondents 

identified standardization with the Mitre’s ATT\&CK Matrix framework as a priority for 

information they consume. 

Producing intelligence involves the addition of other sources of data, most of which 

haven’t yet been processed or analyzed. These data sources include network traffic 

logs, vulnerability data, user behavior data and security data gathered from IDS, SIEMs 

and other internal security systems. A hybrid form of data also exists, for example 

information about a previous incident that has already been processed and analyzed in 

an IR context and will now be used to answer CTI requirements. 

Most respondents collect 

data from a variety of 

sources. This year we saw 

a significant increase

increase in respondents reporting the use of open source threat feeds as a collection 

source and a 14% increase in the use of open source threat intelligence management 

tools such as Collaborative Research Into Threats (CRITs) and Malware Information 

Sharing Platform (MISP). One respondent wrote that their organization is using MISP 

more heavily now that there is an increased emphasis on attacker TTPs rather than 

just IoC aggregation. Although we did not ask specifically about Mitre’s ATT\&CK Matrix 

framework in the 2020 survey, several respondents wrote in that their organizations have 

had success, particularly in adding contextual information to alerts and in prioritizing 

responses, by leveraging it.

Information gathering goes hand in hand with requirements in that requirements 

dictate what information the organization needs to collect. Although there are far 

fewer examples this year of organizations gathering information they don’t need, some 

respondents still report their organizations spend money on data that they do not need 

or are unable to utilize. Just as with requirements, information should also periodically 

be evaluated to ensure that it is effective and usable. A data source that may have been 

critical in the past might no longer be needed, and new data sources might need to be 

identified as the organization and the threat landscape change. 

Dissemination 

In order for intelligence to be effective, 

it must get to the right audience in a 

way they are able to use it. The process 

of getting intelligence to its intended 

audience is called dissemination. CTI is 

primarily disseminated in the form of 

reports or briefings that summarize a 

particular threat or is disseminated to 

tools used to generate alerts or inform 

other security teams in an automated

fashion. The majority of respondents use methods meant to disseminate intelligence 

to people, such as email, spreadsheets or PowerPoint presentations. For many, this 

is done on a regular basis such as weekly threat reports, daily email\-based briefs to 

other security teams or newsletters for general employee awareness. Briefings are 

also high on the list of ways to disseminate CTI, with respondents reporting regularly 

scheduled briefings as well as briefings for urgent issues, such as identifying when their 

organization has been targeted. See Figure 10\.

When it comes to intelligence meant to be understood by others in the organization, 

a high degree of personalization based on the audience’s preferences is needed. As 

one respondent put it, “Intelligence needs to be 

dissected before reaching different business units 

TAKEAWAYS

so it can be actionable.” Finance will need a slightly 

different version of a brief that focuses on their 

specific business concerns than will the team 

responsible for brand protection, for example. 

Intelligence is also disseminated to tools used 

for alerting. Most organizations rely on a threat 

intelligence platform for this purpose. Respondents 

report a similar number of organizations using 

open source, vendor\-created or homegrown threat 

intelligence platforms to disseminate intelligence 

to other security systems. While the percentage 

of respondents using vendor platforms has been 

consistent in the past two years, the use of open 

source and homegrown systems has increased. 

• The development of CTI requirements is the first phase of the 

intelligence cycle and will help an organization ensure that the 
work being done meets the needs of their security program. More 
organizations are developing requirements, but the organizations that 
have not yet formalized this process can start by identifying the teams 
who leverage CTI and asking what questions they have or what problems 
they are consistently running into that CTI could help address. 

• Although CTI data can come from a variety of sources, leveraging 
a framework such as Mitre’s ATT\&CK Matrix framework during 
the processing phase can help analysts identify trends and make 
connections between the different sources. 

• Even the best\-analyzed CTI products become ineffective if they don’t 
reach the right audience in a timely manner. With more organizations 
producing their own intelligence, it is critical to make sure the 
audience—and the way they best consume intelligence—is taken into 
consideration before dissemination.

Value and Inhibitors of CTI

Respondents noted they are using CTI across the spectrum of detection, response, 

prevention and mitigation. 

CTI Uses and Use Cases

At a high level, the leading use was for threat detection

(89%), followed by threat prevention (77%), threat response 

(72%) and threat mitigation (59%). Organizations focusing too 

heavily on threat prevention often struggle with detection 

and response, which would otherwise be core to their ability 

to maintain great prevention over time. It’s clear from this

driver. See Figure 11\.

The detection and response use cases deemed most valuable in weighted analysis 

order were IoCs, threat behaviors and adversary TTPs, digital footprint or attack 

surface identification, and strategic analysis of the adversary, respectively. Figure 12 

illustrates the raw rankings of each in terms value to organizations. While IoCs still 

seem to reign as a major value add to programs, there has been a growing focus on 

TTPs in organizations. As organizations have the proper tooling to leverage TTPs more 

effectively, they will likely edge out IoCs as a primary detection mechanism.

Figure 11\. CTI Detection, Response, 
Prevention and Mitigation

Combining TTPs and IoCs can form a powerful 

detection and response strategy. Instead of 

running IoCs over every piece of data and thus 

increasing false positives, consider leveraging 

TTPs as a primary detection strategy and 

then running the associated IoCs against the 

subset of detections based off of TTPs. As 

an example, running indicators associated 

with VPNs against all network traffic would 

yield a higher level of false positives than 

running those same indicators against only 

network traffic that alerted against TTP\-based 

detections associated with malicious use of 

VPNs. This allows analysts to have a more

Measuring Effectiveness and the Value of CTI

One obviously difficult area for organizations every year is measuring the effectiveness 

of cyber threat intelligence. The message is clear: 82% of respondents’ organizations 

find value in it, with 17% not being sure of how to answer and fewer than 1% of 

respondents noting that CTI did not improve their security and response efforts. 

But measuring exactly what value it is bringing in a structured and defined way is 

understandably difficult. Only 4% of respondents had processes in 

place to measure effectiveness (see Figure 13\). There is no one\-

size\-fits\-all strategy to measuring intelligence, but it must start with 

the intelligence requirements phase. Organizations with clearly 

defined intelligence requirements can use those requirements to 

set obtainable goals based on the intent behind the requirement. 

When looking at security and response use cases, these 

measurements can be mapped to overall defender\-based metrics 

instead of simply tracking adversary metrics.

Adversary metrics are those metrics that the adversary controls. 

As an example, if you were to track the number of intrusions you 

see per year, that metric would be influenced by two things: how 

often an adversary targets your network and how often you detect 

the intrusion. Of those two, the defender can only control how

Effectiveness

often they detect the intrusion. The adversary alone determines how often and how 

aggressively they target any given organization. Reporting only on adversary metrics 

can tell a misleading story that is difficult for CTI teams to understand. Instead, 

consider what story you can tell with defender\-based metrics. For example, against 

the known threats that you track and your coverage against the TTPs they’ve shown. 

Historically, are you increasing the analytical breadth (coverage) and analytical depth 

(multiple detections for a single TTP) of your detections against the threats? How 

many IR playbooks has the CTI team contributed to based on their insights? How 

long did it previously take to scope your organization and with what level of visibility 

versus what you can to today based on investments in people, process and technology 

across the organization? These are all defender\-based metrics, because you can 

directly influence them and use them to tell your story more than the adversary’s. 

Measurements are not only done in metrics, but the right metrics can tell a powerful 

story or identify issues to correct. 

Inhibitors Holding Programs Back

There are many reasons CTI teams can struggle, including those beyond their control 

such as management support or company resources. Sometimes it can also just be 

difficult to get started. When asked about the biggest inhibitors, it was clear the focus 

was on people and processes. The leading issue at 57% was the lack of trained staff and 

skills associated with fully utilizing CTI. The next leading issue at 52% was the time to 

implement proper intelligence processes across the team. Interestingly, the lowest issue, 

2020 SANS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Survey

13

selected by 23%, was confidence in using the information to make decisions (see Figure 

14\). CTI practitioners and the teams using threat intelligence seem to clearly understand 

how to use it to support them and understand its value but are stretched thin on finding 

the appropriate talent. It was good 

to see that only a minority suffered 

from lack of management buy\-in as 

well, which appears to note that the 

value propositions of CTI are well 

understood in most organizations at 

a variety of levels.

Participants were asked about their 

level of satisfaction with various 

aspects of CTI. The highest level of 

satisfaction for respondents was 

their ability to have visibility into 

threats (75%), search and report on 

those threats (73%) and have relevant 

threat data and information (72%).

Automation and integration of CTI information through respondents’ tooling still scored 

well (61%), but the lowest rated area was machine learning with 36% satisfaction and 

58% outright dissatisfaction in the effectiveness or value of it. Tools can add a lot of 

value for intelligence analysis, but the process is heavily dependent on analysts.

Sharing Is Caring

Randomly sharing IoCs by plugging in threat feeds can lead to 

more harm than good. The CTI community has become more 

regimented about how it uses intelligence, and while IoCs are still 

of great value, most organizations have become more thoughtful 

in how they source this data. This much is clear: Sharing and 

networking are still core components of success for the community. 

Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) are not available 

to all respondents, although there was great global distribution in 

the home country of participants in the survey. And yet 45% still 

answered that they are members of an ISAC (see Figure 15\). The 

biggest inhibitors based on comments was the cost of some of the 

ISACs’ membership dues.

As organizations mature, it is a common complaint that ISACs for threat information 

become less valuable. However, this simply means the organizations are outgrowing the 

perceived effectiveness, which is an overall good thing. In those cases, points of contact 

at other organizations become invaluable for going beyond the immediate sharing of 

available information and analysis on emerging threats and trends.

Whereas ISACs received high marks, there was a bit less consensus on the role and 

value of government in CTI. See Figure 17\.

government thinks matter the most. Similar to the value propositions of the ISACs for 

more mature organizations, as the industry matures, the government should likely seek 

to take a role of empowering ISACs and adding additional amplification and context 

around known public threats in a wider forum.

Conclusion: Keep Moving Forward

A lot of progress has been made in the past few years around requirements. 

Next steps in this area include identifying when and why to update intelligence 

requirements—even ad hoc adjustments can be planned for by identifying 

the circumstances under which they would need to be changed. It is also 

Takeaway

clear that there are numerous positive trends in the community, such as more 

organizations producing intelligence instead of just consuming it. But there are 

also many challenges, such as getting the appropriate staffing and training to 

conduct cyber threat intelligence. Tools and data sources are always going to be 

vital to the process, but the world of intelligence analysis is inherently analyst\-

driven and a focus is rightfully placed there. 

Sharing not only IoCs and adversary TTPs, but also processes and analytic 

processes, will help the community continue to mature. Some processes to 

share include strategies for measuring the effectiveness of a CTI program. These 

metrics should be based on requirements and should be defender\-based 

metrics—for example, how long did it previously take to scope your organization 

and with what level of visibility vs. what you can to today based on investments 

in people, process and technology across the organization? While the specific 

metrics will likely differ from organization to organization, the processes can be 

developed leveraging shared best practices and ideally can be built into tools 

in the future, both commercial and open\-source, making the process timely, 

effective and repeatable. 

In the coming year, get more 
involved in the community and 
find the best practices from 
other organizations, especially 
around intelligence requirements 
and analyst development. With 
many changes in the world in 
the coming year, from political 
elections and global trade 
tensions, to natural disasters 
with unknown consequences, CTI 
analysts will likely be asked to 
focus on new and unanticipated 
threats. Being part of a community 
of intelligence analysts sharing 
threat data, best practices and 
lessons learned will help everyone 
adapt to rapidly changing 
situations and provide intelligence 
to protect critical networks.
