Penetration testing is a vital method to evaluate the security of an organization.
By attempting to exploit potential security weaknesses of all kinds, from
misconfigurations to end user mistakes, organizations can proactively take action
before an attack occurs.
Having spent over two decades observing and participating in the evolution of
penetration testing, Core Security, A HelpSystems Company, wanted to ascertain
the role penetration testing plays across organizations of different sizes and
industries. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive picture of the effectiveness
of ethical hacking strategies, and the resources required to deploy a successful pen
testing program.
The results of this global survey, which will be explored in detail in this report,
provide valuable data on the following key issues related to pen testing:
*   Why to pen test
*   Remediation efforts
*   Finding skilled personnel
*   Executive buy in
*   Choosing toolsets
*   How results are reported
*   Compliance concerns

This survey data establishes a strong baseline to track year over year changes,
trends, and areas of improvement. With its inauguration, we have sought to create
a valuable resource from which the community of cybersecurity professionals can
benefit.

# Introduction

www.coresecurity.com

One of the biggest concerns across organizations appears to
be getting others to act on the findings (Figure 1). However,
97% of respondents noted that penetration testing was at least
somewhat important to their security posture (Figure 2).

This implies that while pen testing programs are encouraged and
supported, suggested remediations are not always implemented.
This shows a mismatch between how important pen testing is
seen and how much priority the results of a pen test are given.
This may represent a lack of understanding of how security
weaknesses correlate to business risks, such as the loss of
revenue, or interruption of critical services.
Despite this, 39% of respondents reported being confident
in their organization’s security posture (Figure 3), which is an
indicator of overconfidence and a common issue in the in the
cybersecurity world. How can you be confident in your security
posture if you do not effectively test it?

# Reasons for Pen Testing

Organizations appear to have an even balance for why they pen test,
with 70% reporting that they perform pen tests for vulnerability
management program support, 69% for measuring security posture,
and 67% for compliance (Figure 4).

## Common Security Concerns

Respondents also reported misconfiguration (77%), phishing (72%),
and poor passwords (60%) as top concerns (Figure 5). This may
indicate that pen testing is a desirable way to test for risks related
to user error. These common entry points are typically best solved
through a combination of retraining efforts and security tools.
Misconfiguration issues can be alleviated with routine training for
the IT teams that are responsible for these systems. Additionally,
automation tools can handle routine administration tasks to maintain
consistent policies. Problems like phishing and poor passwords
can occur throughout the organization, and will need consistent
reeducation sessions, particularly for those who fail phishing
simulations. Password tools can enforce strong password policies to
reduce risk. Ultimately, maintaining your security posture over time
requires regular penetration testing and retesting to see if these
efforts are effective.

## Reasons for Penetration Testing

# Compliance and Pen Testing

Figure 6: Importance of penetration testing for compliance

The need to stay compliant or adhere to external mandates was a
primary reason respondents pen testing (68%), as seen in Figure 4.
95% of respondents reported that pen testing held some level of
importance for their compliance initiatives.
Much of the most important data (Figure 7) for respondents to
protect—customer, patient, financial, or employee—fall under
some sort of regulation or industry best practice. NIST, SOX, NERC,
HIPAA, CMMC, and GDPR will most likely be followed by additional
mandates that emphasize the importance of protecting sensitive
data, ensuring that pen testing will continue to be a critical tool for
organizations needing to demonstrate the effectiveness of their
security programs.

*A pie chart titled "How important is penetration testing to your compliance initiatives?" shows the following percentages: Not at all important (5%), Somewhat important (27%), Important (68%).*

# Phishing

Phishing attempts are nearly impossible to block from every inbox
and are an incredibly common way for attackers to gain access
to employee credentials and an organization’s systems. 72% of
respondents noted that phishing was a top security concern,
indicating that organizations are very aware of the risk that this
attack strategy poses (Figure 5).
Phishing simulations can be run to see what type of ploys are tricking
employees, and who is susceptible to them. These social engineering
pen tests are a valuable tool for education and awareness, which are
the primary prevention methods for this type of attack. However,
19% responded that they never conduct phishing simulations,
and 25% only conduct them annually, which may indicate a lack of
awareness of how helpful frequent phishing simulations are, or a lack
of resources (Figure 8).

Figure 8: Frequency of phishing simulations

*A bar chart titled "How often does your organization conduct phishing simulations?" shows the following percentages for each frequency: Ongoing (14%), Monthly (19%), Quarterly (23%), Annually (25%), Never (19%).*

# Penetration Testing Frequency

Figure 9: Frequency of penetration testing

It is promising to see that only a small percentage of respondents
(15%) indicated that they never pen test. This indicates that pen
testing is viewed as a critical practice that makes an impact in an
organization’s security posture. Ideally, as long as it done by the right
people and with the right tools, pen tests should be run as frequently
as possible, particularly when significant changes or updates are
made to the infrastructure (Figure 9).
The largest percentage of respondents (32%) test one to two times
a year. While this may help sort priorities about security weaknesses,
it does indicate a lack of re-testing, which is an important way to
validate remediation efforts. Those with internal pen testing teams
did report testing more frequently, with 47% reporting monthly or
quarterly testing, versus 33% of everyone surveyed. This indicates
that testing frequency is most likely heavily influenced by budget
and resources.
20% of respondents reported pen testing daily or weekly. Pen
testing is typically quite a large undertaking, so there may be a
misunderstanding about the difference between a vulnerability scan,
which can be run daily or weekly, and a full pen test.

*A bar chart titled "How often does your organization pen test?" shows the following percentages for each frequency: Weekly (9%), Quarterly (17%), Daily (11%), 1-2 times a year (32%), Never (15%), Monthly (16%).*

# In-House Penetration Testing Efforts

Figure 10: In-house penetration testing

While some businesses exclusively enlist the services of a third-party
penetration testing team, it is now quite common to build an in-house
team, with 42% of respondents working at organizations that have one
in place (Figure 10).
Teams remain relatively small, with 84% of respondents reporting teams
of five dedicated team members or fewer (Figure 11). It is also possible
that these teams are assisted by personnel that have pen testing tasks
as part of their duties, but aren’t considered full time team members.
Additionally, other organizations may still perform pen testing activities,
but don’t have teams solely for this purpose.
Once in place, these teams seem to prove themselves valuable. Only 7%
responded that their in-house team is now defunct, perhaps showing
that once in place, organizations prefer to keep them intact. In fact, 46%
of respondents that have in-house teams noted that they were confident
in their security posture versus the only 29% of those that did not have
an internal team (Figure 12).
It is also worth noting that 61% of those that reported they did not have
an internal team were in an organization with fewer than 500 employees,
and represented 70% of those reporting that they didn’t have enough
need. Smaller organizations may not be able to justify the resources
required to have an in-house team. Their needs may be adequately met
by third party services, since their IT infrastructures aren’t as large, so
testing is not such a time consuming effort (Figure 13).

*A pie chart titled "Do you have an in-house penetration testing team?" shows the following percentages: No, but we have in the past (7%), No, we’ve never had an in-house penetration testing team (51%), Yes (42%).*

# In-House Penetration Testing
## Staffing Challenges

Figure 14: Reasons for not having an in-house pen testing team

There are many reasons cited for not having an in-house penetration
testing team. 40% cited lack of talent and 42% cited lack of funding,
which aligns with the ongoing skills shortage in the cybersecurity
field (Figure 14). There are not enough experienced pen testers to
go around, and those that are can be very expensive. This is further
reflected by the fact that 49% of respondents reported that their staff
has three years or fewer of experience with pen testing (Figure 15).

60% indicated that technology plays an influence in whether or not
they have an in-house team, demonstrating the vital the role pen
testing tools can play for in-house pen testing teams (Figure 16).
Some tools can help combat the talent obstacle, as they function not
only as a way to streamline and enhance pen testing efforts, but also
as a way to standardize testing and enable comparing results.

*A bar chart titled "Why doesn't your organization have an in-house penetration testing team?" shows the following percentages for each reason: Lack of talent/skill (40%), Leverage third parties exclusively (42%), Lack of funding (28%), Not enough need to employ a full-time pen tester/team (24%), Other (7%), Lack of executive sponsorship (45%).*

# Purple Teams

Figure 17: Utilization of a purple team approach

Purple teaming, which focuses on aligning the efforts of both red and
blue teams, creates a communicative joint team that shares the goal
of improving security. 39% of respondents reported that they have
already implemented the approach (Figure 17).
Considering the amount of resources—time, money, and
personnel—needed to institute this approach, this number is
surprisingly high. Respondents may only be using purple teams for
small engagements.
These responses imply that the idea of purple teaming is becoming
more widely accepted as best practice, and that it is not a
disagreement on strategy, but rather the amount of effort needed to
implement a comprehensive purple team exercise that is the main
inhibiting factor. This move towards purple teams, even for small
engagements, is positive, since purple teams are more collaborative
and make testing efforts even more effective with unified, cohesive
plans, goals, and strategies.

*A bar chart titled "Do you utilize a purple team approach (red and blue teams working together) in your pen-testing strategy?" shows the following percentages: No, but we are considering it (30%), No, we don't have any plans to implement (31%), Yes (39%).*

# Penetration Testing Tools

Figure 18: Active use of penetration testing software

Nearly all respondents indicated that they use penetration testing
tools of some kind, and 72% of respondents noted that they used
free and/or open source tools (Figure 18). This falls in line with
the common practice of multiple tools that meet different needs.
For example, commercial testing tools, used by nearly 50% of
respondents, can provide commercial-grade exploits that open source
tools may not be able to offer. Using a combination of both open
source and commercial tools aligns with the 62% of respondents that
indicated cost as an important consideration (Figure 19).
Using a variety of tools also appears to be a practical solution
given how important features were noted to be when evaluating
a tool (83%), and the wide range of features respondents consider
important when looking for in a pen testing tool (Figure 19).
Among the most desired features were templates/automation
capabilities, an extensive threat library, and multi-vector testing
capabilities. Reporting was the most popular, with 69% of
respondents listing it as an important feature (Figure 20). This
may be due to compliance needs, which often require extensive
documentation to prove adherence to certain regulations and
industry practices. Reporting is also an arduous, time-consuming task,
so good reporting functionality can streamline things considerably.

*A bar chart titled "Does your organization actively use penetration testing software or tools?" shows the following percentages: Yes, free or open source tools (72%), Yes, commercial tools (49%), No (12%).*

# Conclusion

Without penetration testing, how do you know if you’re at risk?
As scary as it can be to find out that you have dangerous security
weaknesses, the only way to eliminate them is to know they are
there in the first place. Penetration testing remains the best way to
keep ahead of adversaries by allowing you to uncover vulnerabilities
before they can.
The goal of this survey was to provide visibility into how
cybersecurity professionals are utilizing pen testing. The results
revealed the wide range of ways that people pen test, indicating
that any organization can tailor a program to suit their needs and
available resources. Third party services are a great option for smaller
organizations who may not yet be able to have someone internal
dedicated full time, but they are also ideal for larger organizations
with in-house teams who need external validation or simply a second
pair of eyes. In-house teams can take many different shapes—small,
large, experienced, novice. Tools are also versatile, and organizations
typically use more than one to get all the features they want and
need. There are any number of combinations of tools that can be
paired together to create a unique suite that ensures a team can
imitate any type of attacker.
Though pen testing programs are not without their challenges, the
amount of options available enable security teams to tweak and
adjust things as needed to get the most out of their efforts. Having
such flexibility in how an organization can put together a pen testing
program will allow the practice of pen testing to continue to thrive as
long as threat actors continue to attack.
