This year, Aon will celebrate 20 years of delivering Cyber Solutions to clients . In 2000, the newly formed Aon 

Technology and Telecommunications Group issued the first insurance policy that covered cyber exposures 

as part of an Errors and Omissions placement . That same year, Stroz Friedberg was founded . Today, we are 

united as Aon’s Cyber Solutions and our greatest advantage is the ability to leverage our experience to benefit 

the needs of our clients . From Risk Transfer, Quantification, Cyber Risk Consulting, Incident Response, Digital 

Forensics, Investigations and Intelligence, and eDiscovery—we have worked and solved some of the world’s 

most difficult challenges .

Our experience and proven ability to exceed clients’ expectations continue to set us apart in an increasingly 

crowded field of competitors . There are no other firms that bring our holistic suite of solutions to market and 

can demonstrate the continuity of performance across these disciplines like we can at Aon’s Cyber Solutions . 

Many firms can only promise the potential to do what we have already done .

As we reflect upon this significant milestone, it is the perfect time to share our 2020 Cyber Security Risk 
Report: Solving the Cyber Puzzle: The Unexpected Ways Cyber Risk Impacts Your Business . 
This year’s Report demonstrates the breadth and depth of our collective understanding of cyber risk 

across Aon . In it, we focus on the unexpected ways that cyber risk impacts clients, in six less\-appreciated 

areas: Intellectual Property, Mergers and Acquisitions, Retirement, Executives, Computer Crime and The 

Corporation . Our experience allows us to see the entire puzzle and how the pieces fit together . As such, 

part of the Report provides a playbook for each highlighted risk to help organizations “solve” the ever\-more\-

complex puzzle that is cyber risk . 

As outlined in our recent white paper, The Cyber Loop: Managing Cyber Risk Requires a Circular Strategy, 

there is nothing linear about cyber security . Solving the cyber puzzle requires a tactical mix of technology, 

people and process in the form of assessment, quantification, insurance and incident response readiness . 

Regardless of where your organization is in its digital journey, the Cyber Loop can help insulate your company 

from a variety of cyber risks . And importantly, it acknowledges that cyber risk is an enterprise risk, not solely 

a technology concern . Companies have a duty to understand that corporate risk–and the threat to business 

continuity and customer data–is at stake .

Every business has a cyber story . We look forward to continuing the story with you for another 20 years as 

your chosen cyber security partner . We remain committed to helping organizations uncover and quantify 

cyber risks, protect critical assets and recover from cyber incidents .

Intellectual Property
THE PUZZLE

Theft, misappropriation or 
infringement of intellectual 
property (IP)—assets that lack 
physical substance such as 
patents, trademarks, copyrights, 
data rights and trade secrets—
poses a significant and growing 
risk to your organization. 
From 2005 to 2018, the value of intangible assets 

held by the five largest companies by market cap 
increased from $9 .28 trillion to $25 .03 trillion .¹ IP is 

valued in excess of $5 trillion . Trade secrets are defined 

differently around the world, but broadly, according to 

the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO),4 

trade secrets include “any confidential business 

information that provides an enterprise a competitive 

edge .” In December 2019, the federal government 

brought criminal charges against two former technology 

company employees accused of stealing trade secrets . 

In its request to monitor the location of the suspected 

perpetrators, the prosecution expressed “deep 

concerns” that the former employees would try to 

flee the U .S . One worked on a secretive self\-driving 

car program and allegedly took files related to the 

project before disclosing his intent to work for a foreign 

core to innovation and business growth, and with

Organizations should allocate appropriate

the weakest link in an organization and IP is vulnerable 

to human error or carelessness . Training that addresses 

how IP can be unintentionally exposed is vital .

way to evaluating risk appetite and then insuring the value 

of the IP that could be compromised . Harvard Business 

Review reports that intangible assets make up 80% of 

the value of S\&P 500 companies . Financial analytics and 

modeling can help inform risk transfer methods, such as 

limits and scope of intellectual property insurance 

coverage . As IP theft becomes a more considerable issue 

and competitors look to increase market share in any 

way, companies may also need to defend themselves 

against accusations of IP infringement or theft . As

Mergers and Acquisitions
THE PUZZLE

The years 2014\-2017 witnessed 
a 96% rise in mergers and 
acquisitions (M\&A) globally,10 
and over the past two 
years close to 50,000 M\&A 
transactions were announced 
worldwide, worth a total of 
more than $3\.5 trillion a year. 
When merging with or acquiring another company, 

an organization may unintentionally inherit the 

target company’s cyber risks and vulnerabilities . 

Executing deals without understanding the 

cyber posture of the target company jeopardizes 

investment capital and future returns can bring 

legal or operational ramifications, and even 

threaten brand reputation and value . 

Cyber threats in M\&A are serious and can be fatal for 

businesses: compromised networks, customer data 

or IP actively being sold on the dark web, historic 

web? Or that the flagship software application requires 

a significant cyber investment? What vulnerabilities 

might the target’s network introduce that need to 

be factored in prior to deal close or on day one? 

Recent examples illustrate the severity of the risk . One 

significant case comes from the hospitality industry, a 

sector that has witnessed an increase in consolidation 

over the past few years .12 In a major breach, the 

information of up to 500 million guest records was 

compromised, triggering potential consequences 

including data regulatory fines and reputational 

damage . Notably the compromise occurred within 

the network of a company that had been acquired 

for $13 .6 billion two years before the incident was 

detected . Reportedly, the hacker(s) had access to the 

acquired company’s network for approximately two 

years before the acquisition, and four years before the 

breach was detected . A regulator cited an apparent 

lack of pre\-deal cyber security due diligence as 

being justification for a proposed $123 million fine

concluding that cyber security is best examined post\-

to disclosures made post\-deal writing and the acquiring 

deal . The M\&A puzzle is complicated . Would the deal

THE PUZZLE

Retirement plans hold a wealth 
of personal and sensitive 
data and are a gateway to 
vast sums of money. 
These plans are increasingly accessed from online 

platforms and mobile devices and thus are susceptible

make headlines, reports in the media are becoming 

more prevalent . News of one breach broke when

Given the amount of data and 
money at stake, it is imperative 
that organizations see the whole 
cyber security picture when it 
comes to retirement plans. 
Risk, technology and human resources teams are all crucial 

players, tasked with collaborating with plan providers to 

exercise due diligence and ensure security safeguards are 

in place . 

An important first step in the retirement protection playbook 

is to conduct a gap assessment to examine vulnerabilities, 

along with the administrative, physical and technical 

protections enveloping the plan such as security governance, 

business operations security and relevant controls . The end 

goal is to protect data from unauthorized access and to 

ensure available technology, process and controls are utilized 

to safeguard plan data and funds . Accomplishing this is more 

complex than it might appear, as plan data resides in many 

forms . Security domains–both internal and external–need to 

be reviewed and third parties that have access to plan 

data and funds evaluated for their cyber security controls . 

Once security gaps and vulnerabilities are identified, a 

risk mitigation plan can be strategized and implemented 

then an incident response (IR) plan developed and put 

into practice . Within the IR plan, privacy regulations need to 

be thought through, ensuring the organization adheres to 

appropriate notification requirements . 

Finally, evaluation of risk responsibility and risk transfer 

options is essential . ERISA requires that claims by plan 

participants be asserted against the plan fiduciary, making 

it prudent to have contractual specifications about data and 

asset security and methods to shift the loss to the service 

provider where warranted . Terms should be negotiated and 

periodically re\-visited . Otherwise, differences may arise over 

which party is responsible for cyber security .22 Depending on 

the type of loss, cyber insurance, fiduciary liability insurance 

or crime insurance may be available to transfer additional risk 

and indemnify the company . 

The end goal is to 
protect data 
from unauthorized 
access .

are pursued for many reasons: influence, reputational

financial reward that is the key motivation behind 

an executive breach . In 71% of executive breaches,

Executive vulnerability assessment 
is a necessity and must consider 
not only areas of potential corporate 
compromise, but also personal and 
family member compromise. 
Organizations need to begin securing the executive team 

outside of its physical and digital walls . The personal 

vulnerability of key executives is an increasing target 

of opportunity for threat actors . Once compromised 

personally, the executive may be leveraged or extorted 

to act on behalf of the attacker or even unknowingly 

carry the cyber threat into the organization .

The open and dark web are prime resources to evaluate an 

executive’s security risk posture . Once the risk is gauged, 

mitigation steps can be taken . Such mitigation actions 

can include hardening of security weaknesses, a focus on 

information governance and data protection, training on 

phishing and social engineering techniques, direction on 

how to lessen open source exposure, as well as knowledge\-

sharing of emerging fraud schemes . Incorporation of security 

technology is also valuable for executives and their family 

members, such as identity theft monitoring, use of secure 

VPNs and password manager tools . However, as with any 

form of technology solution, it is only useful if implemented .

Insurance is also available to help executives mitigate the 

impact of identity theft, business email compromise (BEC) 

losses and ransomware attacks . While cyber insurance 

is available to protect the corporation against liability 

and financial loss arising out of a breach of corporate 

networks, executives may want to add a layer of personal 

cyber insurance protection outside the corporate veil . This 

coverage is available at many corporations as an executive or 

employee benefit . Personal cyber security insurance coverage 

continues to be an evolving area that companies should 

contemplate for their board, executives and employees .

Computer Crime
THE PLAYBOOK

The Puzzle: Computer Crime

To guard against cybercrime, 
a proactive cyber security and 
fraud risk assessment, combined 
with a gap analysis, can help 
identify vulnerabilities and 
provide a path to pinpointing 
your organization’s risk. 
Next, instituting the right controls to guide customer 

and vendor relationships will aid in reducing fraud and 

cybercrime exposure . The following questions must 

be painstakingly explored: Does the organization have 

a procedure in place to verify new customers prior to 

initiating any financial transaction? How are fund transfer 

instructions accepted, for example: telephone, fax, email, 

text or other similar method? For vendors, how does the 

organization confirm requested changes to contracts or 

banking details? Are change confirmations sent, and if 

so, to whom and via what method? Controls across voice 

and electronic initiated fund transfers also need to be 

evaluated even as they span business units and regions . 

Not to be overlooked is continuous cyber education . 

This curriculum should be customized for employee 

categories, considering various characteristics such 

as seniority and data access rights, travel habits and 

overall cyber risk profile . It is recommended that training 

extend from simple concepts—such as the importance 

of strong passwords—to content covering common and 

current scams and how to avoid being a victim . Deeper 

concepts, such as verifying identities and the legitimacy 

of online communication, are also critical to explore .

Even with controls and training in place, the risk is 

pervasive . Risk transfer via insurance is available, yet it 

can be a challenge to know which coverage is intended 

to indemnify for what type of digital loss . Generally, crime 

coverage covers theft of money or securities and can 

be expanded to cover BEC/EAC financial loss via a social 

engineering endorsement . Cyber insurance is available 

to cover breach\-related expenses arising out of a cyber 

extortion, including the ransom demand, computer forensics 

costs and associated business disruption expenses or net 

income loss . Should that ransomware attack turn into a data 

breach, cyber insurance may indemnify for the associated 

costs of that as well, including liability costs, regulatory 

fines and penalties where insurable, as well as the costs 

of notification, public relations and credit monitoring .

Does the organization 
have a procedure 
to verify new 
customers prior to 
initiating any financial 
transaction?

Cyber security and corporate 
liability risk are interwoven. 
In our 2019 Risk Report, we 
discussed that the board

regulatory fines and costs 
associated with investigations 
in response to cyber breaches.

ramifications to the organization’s ability to execute 

strategic plans dependent on securing funds . 

Though uncommon, bankruptcy is an unexpected 

yet plausible risk of a significant breach . In 2019, the 

parent company of a medical collection agency went 

from breach to bankruptcy filing in just two weeks . 

The compromised data included client information 

belonging to the collection agencies’ customers, and 

as a result, various healthcare entities and service 

providers ended up disclosing the breach publicly . 

Along with an exodus of its client base and lost revenue, 

the investigation into the incident cost $400,000,

THE PLAYBOOK

The Puzzle: The Corporation

CYBER RISKS Intellectual Property \| Mergers and Acquisitions \| Retirement \| Executives \| Computer Crime \| The Corporation \| 

Cyber risk—as a form of 
corporate risk—is directly tied 
to balance sheet impact. 
Companies should consider an organizational assessment 

and sensitive data mapping exercise to identify data that 

requires enhanced protection and governance, especially 

given the current environment of evolving (and increasing) 

global privacy regulation . Quantifying the financial impact 

of a cyber event is essential not only for good corporate 

governance, but also for strategic decision\-making . A 

breach scenario impact analysis can bring needed visibility 

to guide investment decisions for information security, 

business continuity programs and risk transfer strategies .

Incident response readiness can help lessen the impact 

of a breach . An effective response can mitigate the potential 

reputational impact and liability from regulatory fines and 

penalties . This may be relevant in several ways, depending 

on the type of breach . It may demonstrate to regulators and 

shareholders that the company was prepared and that the 

directors and officers did not breach their fiduciary duty 

to the company . In the case of a credit card breach, it is 

important to have an independent forensic investigator to 

work with counsel to ensure that the PCI Forensic Investigator 

(PFI) reporting is accurate to minimize potential fines . 

Robust data protection and governance programs 

should be established to include a holistic approach to 

identify, assess, protect, monitor and manage sensitive 

data throughout its lifecycle, regardless of where it is 

stored across the organization’s operations . This will 

commonly require the integration of privacy compliance 

and cyber security initiatives and will typically employ 

various forms of technology, process and standards 

as well as policies across the organization . 

Cyber breaches in recent years have led to investor 

scrutiny and event\-driven litigation is a significant exposure 

for corporate leadership . Insurance can play a part in 

protecting companies from the liability associated with 

a breach . However, the insurance purchase for breach\-

related risk transfer is not one\-size\-fits\-all . Directors’ and 

Officers’ liability insurance is vital to protect the corporation 

and the personal assets of the board against the costs 

of defending litigation and paying judgment awards or 

settlements . Other lines of coverage may come into play 

as well, such as employment practices liability coverage 

to protect against BIPA\-related employment litigation . 

Cyber insurance is also an option for evolving privacy and 

security risks to protect companies against the financial 

statement impact of a breach, as well as provide pre\-loss 

prevention and post\-loss services, to help organizations 

to recover more quickly from the impact of a breach .

A breach scenario 
impact analysis can 
bring visibility to guide 
investment decisions .

Taken together, the 
recommendations in 
this playbook have 
one chief goal: 

To help enhance the 
organization’s position 
against evolving 
cyber security 
risks and threats.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

Putting It All Together 

This playbook is designed to help organizations be successful while operating 
in a digital environment that presents great opportunity–and great risk . It 
pulls together thinking that considers less\-publicized cyber risks: intellectual 
property, mergers and acquisitions, retirement, executives, computer crime and 
the corporation, adding these pieces to the evolving cyber risk puzzle . 

Some of the plays to solve for cyber risk remain the same: stay 
informed, understand the organization’s risk profile and be proactive 
in its defense. Others require more advanced action: 

 √

Identify your organization’s most critical data, dependent systems and business processes, 
and know where on the network they reside; 

 √

Establish a sound incident response plan and put the plan into practice; 

 √ Develop a regular cyber risk assessment program to track remediation progress and 

measure against evolving threats; 

 √

 √

Regularly test critical access points against cyber intrusion, especially new points of 
connectivity; 

Become deeply literate in risk transfer and understand what your portfolio of property and 
casualty insurance policies does or does not cover related to cyber security; 

 √ Use financial modeling to quantify potential loss; 

 √

Stay abreast of regulations and be aware that disclosing risk may be just as important as 
disclosing a breach; 

 √

Realize the growing vulnerability of the executive team; 

 √ Maintain a holistic cyber security program to include preventive, detective and 
reactive measures and controls, and mechanisms for continuous improvement .

Taken together, the recommendations in this playbook have one chief goal: 
To help enhance the organization’s position against 
evolving cyber security risks and threats.
