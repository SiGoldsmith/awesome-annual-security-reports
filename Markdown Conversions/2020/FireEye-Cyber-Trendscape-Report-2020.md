## Executive Summary
Welcome to the 2020 FireEye Cyber Trendscape report.

In 2019, FireEye worked with KANTAR, an independent market research organization to perform a large-scale cyber
security research initiative involving over 800 senior executives from North America (U.S. and Canada), Europe (France,
Germany and the UK) and Asia (China, Japan and South Korea).

The goal of this initiative was to identify trends impacting cyber security decisions, the top cyber security priorities for
2020 and beyond, the focus of risk mitigation strategies, and to highlight the overall beliefs and perceptions held by
senior executives regarding the state of the cyber threat landscape and how the cyber security industry, governments
and regulatory agencies are responding to their needs.

The study highlights five cyber security focus areas within organizations:
*   The cyber threat landscape
*   Top cyber security program initiatives and overall maturity
*   Balancing the needs of business operations and ensuring resilience to cyber threats
*   Supporting security operations
*   Driving cyber security efficiency

The report provides direct insights that will help organizations benchmark their cyber security initiatives, offers data
points on leading issues that can be used to support critical decision making and provides context for discussions with
senior leadership, board members and other key stakeholders.

## Key Findings
While the findings include regional nuances, representatives from participating organizations were remarkably consistent
in their views and perspectives of cyber security. Also, different attitudes appeared to influence how individuals and
organizations approach cyber security across the world.

### Cyber Environments
Over 90% of organizations believe cyber threats will
stay the same or worsen in 2020 and the top three
industry sectors believed to be the most likely
targets of a cyber attack are finance and banking,
technology and government.

The biggest concerns for organizations during a
cyber attack or breach event are loss of sensitive
data, impacts to customers and business operation
disruptions.

### Security Approaches
Finding a balance between cyber security and
operational requirements is a challenge for 63% of
organizations.

In the US, 51% of organizations believe cloud is more
secure than their on-premise environment however
globally, 60% of organizations prefer an on-premise
email system to cloud-based.

Globally, 88% of organizations have active initiatives
related to the use of artificial intelligence and 86%
have active initiatives on the use of block chain.

### Plans and Preparation
Globally, 51% of organizations do not believe they are
ready or would respond well to a cyber attack or breach
event. Nearly 29% of organizations who have cyber
attack and breach response plans have not tested or
updated their plans in 12 or more months. Over 40% of
organizations do not have or have only very limited as-
needed cyber security training for their employees.

### Financial and Personnel Considerations
Over 72% of organizations consider the cost of cyber
security to be reasonable or inexpensive for the value
it provides.

To help better address their cyber security needs,
76% of organizations are planning cyber security
budget increases for 2020 with most indicating
planned increases of 1-9% over the current 2019
cyber security budget which, on average, is
equivalent to 6-7% of the overall IT budget.

While 91% of organization currently have or are planning
to obtain cyber security insurance in the next 18 months,
56% of organizations who currently have cyber security
insurance thought it difficult to find and overall
expressed concerns over the value it provided.

Nearly 60% of organizations globally do not have a
security information and event manager (SIEM) within
their environments.

The average staffing of a security operations center
(SOC) is 11-30 people and 60% of organizations who
have a SOC are planning to grow this staffing level over
the next 18 months. Germany has over 250% more
organizations that do not have a SOC than the global
average.

### Views on Attacks
Organizations believe the most likely attribution for the
attacks they experienced over the past 12 months are
hacker groups, individual hackers and criminal
organizations. Globally, nation states were considered
the least likely source of cyber attacks. Only in South
Korea were they considered one of the top three most
likely sources.

## Methodology and Participants
This research study was commissioned by FireEye and delivered
by KANTAR, an independent market research organization. The
results were derived from an online survey fielded in July and
August of 2019 for a total of over 800 responses spanning across
North America (US and Canada), Europe (France, Germany and
the UK) and Asia (China, Japan and South Korea).

Setup questions were used to ensure that only cyber security
executives were in the sample. The findings represent the views
from three senior organizational roles with 45% of participants at
C-level an above, 17% at the vice president level and 38% at the
senior director level. The participants were 68% men and 32%
women. Canada had the largest percentage of women
participants (42%).

Higher education was universally valued with 46% of all
participants possessing university degrees and a further 34%
indicating they had also completed graduate studies.

### Line of Business and Industry Sector
Globally, 53% of participants reported into the IT organization, 20% reported to business operations, 13% to finance, 11% to
a dedicated cyber security function and 4% to legal.

In the U.S. the breakdown was more pronounced with 78% reporting to IT, 10% to business operations, 6% to finance, 4%
to cyber security and 2% to legal.

*Figure 1. Participant role in their organization.*
A pie chart showing the distribution of participant roles: 45% C-Level Executive, 17% Vice President, and 38% Senior Director.

*Figure 2. Department of the participant.*
A bar chart comparing the department of participants in the US vs Global. US: 78% IT, 10% Business Operations, 6% Finance/Accounting, 4% Cyber Security, 2% Legal. Global: 53% IT, 20% Business Operations, 13% Finance/Accounting, 11% Cyber Security, 4% Legal.

Participants had operational oversight, budgeting oversight and were responsible for setting the overall cyber security
priorities with their organizations.

Nearly a dozen industry segments were represented in the study. The top three industries, technology, industrial and
manufacturing and banking and finance accounted for 71% of all participants.

### Organizational Structure
Sixty-two percent of participants reported that their organizations had a formal CIO or similar role, while others reported
a CISO/CSO role (50%), chief compliance officer (34%), chief risk officer (26%), chief privacy officer (24%) and general
counsel (20%).

The regions with the highest presence of chief compliance officers or similar roles were the UK (43%), France (41%), the
U.S. (40%) and China (38%).

## Assessing and Addressing Cyber Risks
Organizations were asked to provide their assessment of the 2020
cyber security threat landscape and their plans for addressing cyber
risks. This included insights into:
*   Their cyber security budgets and the focus of their risk
    mitigation strategies.
*   Their assessment of the performance and value of cyber
    security solutions and of government and regulatory agencies.
*   The most likely and most vulnerable targets of cyber attacks.
*   The most likely source of cyber attacks they experienced over
    the past 12 months.

The overall perception of the outlook for cyber risks in 2020 by global
participants was grim with 56% believing that it would worsen over
the next 12 months and 33% were of the opinion it would stay the
same. The most pessimistic participant views were from U.S. (74%)
and Japan (72%) where risks from cyber threats were expected to
worsen over the next 12 months.

Participants also believed that cyber threats were becoming more
difficult to understand and defend against. Responses 4 and 5 (“more difficult”) accounted on average a total of 70% of
responses globally. However, in Canada and Korea, 84% of respondents chose responses 4 and 5, signaling increased
concerns in these countries over the evolving complexity of the cyber threat landscape.

### Balancing Cyber Security and Operations
Organizations universally reported that it was more difficult to find
a balance between cyber security and operational requirements
with 14% reporting it to be very difficult and 49% difficult. Only 14%
of organizations found it easy and 3% found it easier to find a
balance. Globally, 18% of organizations were neutral on the issue.

Participants from Japan reported that 54% of their organizations
found it difficult and 18% very difficult to find a balance between
cyber security and operational requirements as did organizations in
Germany with 53% reporting difficult and 13% more difficult.

In France, 26% of organizations reported that it was neither easier
nor more difficult than before to find a balance between cyber
security and operations requirements.

There were no significant regional differences for organizations that
indicated it was easy or easier to find a balance between security
and operations; they corresponded closely to global results.

*Figure 6. Understanding and defending against cyber threats.*
A bar chart showing the distribution of responses on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 represents "Easier" and 5 represents "More Difficult," regarding the difficulty of understanding and defending against cyber threats.

*Figure 7. Ease of finding a good balance between cyber security and operational requirements.*
A bar chart showing the distribution of responses on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 represents "Easier" and 5 represents "More Difficult," regarding the ease of finding a good balance between cyber security and operational requirements.

### Cyber Security Budgets
When planning to protect themselves against the cyber threat landscape, 78% of organizations reported security
budgets that were over 6% of the overall IT budget. The largest concentration of responses accounted for 37% of the
total and identified security budgets in the 6-7% range.

Globally, 76% of organizations reported planning net security budget increases in 2020. In the U.S., 39% of participants
were planning security budget increases of 10% or more compared with the UK (30%), Korea (22%), China (17%), France
(17%) and Canada (13%).

In Japan and Korea, a full 25% of organizations were planning to keep their 2020 security spend at the same level as 2019
compared with a global average of 13%.

The only countries where organizations were planning to decrease their security budget by more than 10% were France
(3%), Japan (3%), Korea (2%) and China (1%).

Globally, organizations allocated their cyber security budgets into four main categories: prevention (42%), detection
(28%), containment (16%) and remediation (14%).

Japan was the only country that changed the order slightly with an emphasis on detection being expressed by 40% of
organizations followed by prevention (35%), containment (13%) and remediation (12%).

A bar chart showing the distribution of planned budget changes for 2020, including increases, decreases, and no change.

### Value of Cyber Security Solutions, Government and Regulatory Agencies
Organizations broadly (57%) believed that the cost of cyber security was reasonable for the value it provides. A further
25% believed it was inexpensive. Countries perceiving cyber security as inexpensive for the value it provides were Canada
(42%) and the UK (38%).

Participants in Japan (29%) and the U.S. (28%) believed cyber security was expensive for the benefits it provides.

*Figure 10. Value of cyber security spend for value provided.*
A pie chart showing the distribution of responses regarding the value of cyber security spend: 25% Inexpensive, 57% Reasonable, and 18% Expensive.

Participants offered a mixed view, nearly equally positive and negative, in their
assessment of technology providers and cyber security vendors, and how well they
were protecting their environment.

Only 8% believed that technology providers and cyber security vendors were doing a
very good job of protecting their environments which is similarly low to the 6%
assessment for a very bad rating. Nearly matching results were also obtained for
good with 34% and bad with 30%. Lastly 22% of organizations did not favor a net
positive or negative assessment.

Organizations were slightly more positive in their assessment of governments and
regulatory agencies and how well they were doing at protecting their environments.
A majority of participants believed governments and regulatory agencies were doing
a good job (42%) or a very good job (11%). A neutral rating was provided by 19% of
global respondents. Of the remaining organizations 23% believed governments and
regulatory agencies were doing a bad job and 4% a very bad job.

A bar chart comparing the ratings of vendors and government/regulatory agencies on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 represents "Very Bad" and 5 represents "Very Good."

### Cyber Attacks
Over 90% of organizations believe cyber threats will stay the same or worsen in 2020.

*Figure 12. Expected change in cyber threats for 2020.*
A bar chart showing the distribution of responses regarding the expected change in cyber threats for 2020: Decrease, Stay the same, and Increase.

Participants believe that the top three industry sectors most likely to be targeted by cyber attacks are finance and
banking (20%), followed by technology (16%) and government (10%).

These results were consistent across nearly all countries represented with only a modest change in emphasis between
them as to which was first and second. The exception was China, where participants believe finance and banking would
be the most likely target, followed by industrial and manufacturing.

*Figure 13. Industry sector most likely to be the target of a cyber attack.*
A bar chart showing the percentage of respondents who believe each industry sector is most likely to be targeted by a cyber attack.

Participants were asked to identify the top three components they believed to be the most likely to be targeted by cyber
attacks and which top three components they believed were the most likely to be vulnerable to a cyber attack.

Participants were globally consistent in their belief that servers and server operating systems, web servers, medical
devices and endpoints were the top three components in both categories.

*Figure 14. Components most likely to be a target of or vulnerable to a cyber attack.*
A bar chart comparing the percentage of respondents who believe each component is most likely to be targeted or vulnerable to a cyber attack. The components include: Endpoints (Laptop and desktop), Firewalls, IoT non Medical, Medical Devices, Mobile Devices (smart phones and tablets), Network Equipment (excluding firewalls), Operational Technologies, Servers and OS, Server Hosted Applications, and Web Servers.

Participants were asked which attack types they believed were most likely to lead to a breach. The responses globally
were generally consistent, identifying the top three as malware (21%), targeted phishing (19%) and exploited
vulnerability (18%).

*Figure 15. Types of cyber attacks most likely to be the cause a breach.*
A bar chart showing the percentage of respondents who believe each type of cyber attack is most likely to cause a breach.

Similar findings were reported regarding the types of cyber attacks that participant organizations had experienced over
the last 12 months.

Globally, 93% of organizations reported some form of successful cyber attack in the past 12 months. Fifteen percent of
organizations in Japan (more than double the global average of 7%) indicated that they had not experienced a successful
cyber attack in the past 12 months.

### Source of Attacks
Organizations were asked to identify the most likely source of attacks against their organizations. Globally, the results
were highly consistent across all countries with hacker groups (31%), individual hackers (18%) and criminal organizations
(17%) coming in as the top three suspects.

Participants in Japan (25%) and Germany (23%) believed the most likely source of cyber attacks were
criminal organizations.

Globally, nation states were considered the least likely source of cyber attacks totaling less than 8% of responses.
Only in South Korea did it make the top three most likely source with over 19% of responses.

*Figure 17. Sources of cyber attacks experienced by organization.*
A bar chart showing the percentage of respondents who believe each source is most likely to be the source of a cyber attack.

## Organizational Maturity and Resilience to Cyber Threats
Many factors impact the maturity of an organization’s cyber security program and its ability to be resilient against
cyber threats.

Participants were asked to provide their insights into the formative elements of their own cyber security program,
how the program was developed and how effective their organization was at responding to and addressing cyber
security issues.

Participants were also asked to describe their internal challenges to maturing their cyber security program and their
biggest fears in the event of a breach.

### Security Program Maturity
When assessing their cyber security programs, 27% of participants characterized them as semi-formal approaches where
efforts were mostly compliance-driven and focused on addressing mandatory regulations, while 24% saw their programs
as informal where the primary focus was addressing critical issues as they occurred.

Globally, 23% of organizations reported formal security programs with a broad, risk-based focus supporting continuous
optimization of processes and approaches, compared to the U.S. (41%) and China (38%).

Only 19% of organizations identified their security program as strategic with intelligence data driving investment
decisions, operational priorities and other critical cyber security factors.

Overall, 7% of organizations indicated they did not have a cyber security program at all. In Canada, this response
jumped to 18%.

*Figure 18. Security program maturity.*
A bar chart showing the distribution of responses regarding the maturity of security programs: No Cyber Security Program, Informal, Semi-Formal, Intelligence Driven, and Formal.

### Cyber Attack and Breach Response Plans
Cyber attack and breach event response plans are critical for ensuring organizational focus and resilience during a cyber
security event.

These plans consist of pre-established and agreed upon actions, procedures, communications and leadership structure
invoked in the event of a cyber incident. To minimize delays and distractions, plans also include legal agreements and
pre-negotiated contracts with all third-parties that might augment operations or render assistance during an event.

Among all organizations excluding those from the U.S., 29% indicated the existence of mature cyber attack and breach
event response and communications plans that are regularly reviewed and updated. The highest results were from the
U.S. (62%) and China (39%).

However, 29% of organizations reported that while they had cyber plans, they had not been tested or updated in 12 or
more months.

Over 30% of organizations indicated that cyber attack and breach event response plans were owned and maintained by
individual businesses or applications and that they were not coordinated within an overall organization-wide plan.

While only 8% of organizations did not have any cyber attack and breach event response plans, the results were higher in
Canada (19%) and Japan (15%).

*Figure 19. Cyber attack and breach response plans.*
A pie chart showing the distribution of responses regarding cyber attack and breach response plans: No plans, Individual Plans, Untested Plans, and Mature Plans.

Organizations universally identified the chief information officer (CIO) as the
leading representative involved in the development or review of the cyber attack
or breach response plan, followed by the chief compliance officer (CCO), IT
security and finally IT operations staff (Fig. 20).

*Figure 20. Roles involved in the development and review of cyber attack and breach response plans.*
A bar chart showing the percentage of respondents who indicated each role is involved in the development and review of cyber attack and breach response plans.

Organizations reported that the main challenges they faced in maturing their organization’s overall cyber security
posture were primarily IT and security technology maturity followed by IT and security process maturity and then
visibility into threats.

*Figure 21. Challenges in maturing cyber security posture.*
A bar chart showing the percentage of respondents who identified each challenge in maturing their cyber security posture.

### Organizational Readiness Against a Cyber Attack or Breach Event
When asked how they would rate their
organization’s readiness to address a cyber
attack or breach event, the respondents
were nearly equally split. Forty-nine percent
considered their organization to be fully
ready with the ability to respond well and
47% indicated that some portions of their
organization would be ready, but overall
they would struggle to respond well. In the
U.S., 72% of respondents were confident in
their organization’s readiness to respond
well to a cyber attack or breach incident,
sharply contrasting with Japan (24%).

Fourteen percent of organizations in Japan
believed they were not ready and would
not respond well to a cyber attack or
breach event, which is significantly higher
than the global average (just over 2%,
excluding responses from Japan).

*Figure 22. Readiness to respond to a cyber attack or breach event.*
A pie chart showing the distribution of responses regarding readiness to respond to a cyber attack or breach event: Fully Ready, Somewhat Ready, and Not Ready.

### Cyber Security Protection
Solutions deployed to protect organizations from cyber attacks range in capability, applicable scope and cost to acquire
and maintain. Organizations were asked which solutions they currently deployed in their organization, which components
they believed provided the best protection and where they would focus future investments if they had unlimited
budgets.

Globally, participants were quite consistent when they identified the components that currently contributed the most
positive impact to their organization’s ability to prevent a cyber attack or breach. Specifically, vulnerability management
had an edge over security software (both slightly above 16%). These were followed by employee training (14%) and then
response plans and security hardware (both slightly above 12%).

*Figure 23. Components that currently had the most positive impact on security.*
A bar chart showing the percentage of respondents who believe each component currently has the most positive impact on security.

Organizations were then asked which component they believed would most positively impact
their organization’s ability to prevent a cyber attack or breach if they had the opportunity to
dramatically increase its the budget or presence.

The results were globally consistent: 15% of organizations believed that increasing the
investment and presence of vulnerability management solutions within their environment
would generate the most impactful results, followed by threat intelligence (13.7%), threat
hunting (12.6%) and employee training (12%).

Looking more deeply into employee cyber security awareness training (Fig. 25):
*   35% of organizations had semi-formal training conducted at regular intervals that addressed compliance and
    typical cyber security awareness topics.
*   29% of organizations had informal training programs focused on meeting core compliance requirements that are
    conducted on an as-needed basis
*   25% had advanced training programs designed to promote broad cyber security awareness and behavioral
    changes through regular mandatory training and evaluation.
*   Over 11% of organizations had no internal employee cyber security training programs.

Organizations consistently reported their greatest concern regarding a cyber attack or breach event as the loss of
sensitive data, followed by customers and business operation disruption.

In the U.S. the greatest concern was business operations disruption. U.S. organizations were least concerned by the
possibility of physical damage to real-world infrastructure.

*Figure 26. Concerns from a cyber attack or breach.*
A bar chart showing the percentage of respondents who indicated each concern is most significant from a cyber attack or breach.

Over 56% of organizations reported that they actively
tested their security posture with automated tools and
attack simulation, while 37% indicated that they had
plans to do so in the next 18 months. Only 7% reported
they currently did not and had no plans to do so in the
next 18 months.

The highest reported use of automated tools was by
U.S. organizations (78%) followed by the UK (70%). The
