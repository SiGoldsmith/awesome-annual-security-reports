Executive Summary 

Welcome to the 2020 FireEye Cyber Trendscape report. 

In 2019, FireEye worked with KANTAR, an independent market research organization to perform a large\-scale cyber 
security research initiative involving over 800 senior executives from North America (U.S. and Canada), Europe (France, 
Germany and the UK) and Asia (China, Japan and South Korea). 

The goal of this initiative was to identify trends impacting cyber security decisions, the top cyber security priorities for 
2020 and beyond, the focus of risk mitigation strategies, and to highlight the overall beliefs and perceptions held by 
senior executives regarding the state of the cyber threat landscape and how the cyber security industry, governments 
and regulatory agencies are responding to their needs. 

The study highlights five cyber security focus areas within organizations: 

• The cyber threat landscape 

• Top cyber security program initiatives and overall maturity 

• Balancing the needs of business operations and ensuring resilience to cyber threats 

• Supporting security operations 

• Driving cyber security efficiency 

The report provides direct insights that will help organizations benchmark their cyber security initiatives, offers data 
points on leading issues that can be used to support critical decision making and provides context for discussions with 
senior leadership, board members and other key stakeholders.

Key Findings 

While the findings include regional nuances, representatives from participating organizations were remarkably consistent 
in their views and perspectives of cyber security. Also, different attitudes appeared to influence how individuals and 
organizations approach cyber security across the world. 

Cyber Environments 

Over 90% of organizations believe cyber threats will 
stay the same or worsen in 2020 and the top three 
industry sectors believed to be the most likely 
targets of a cyber attack are finance and banking, 
technology and government. 

The biggest concerns for organizations during a 
cyber attack or breach event are loss of sensitive 
data, impacts to customers and business operation 
disruptions. 

Financial Considerations 

Over 72% of organizations consider the cost of cyber 
security to be reasonable or inexpensive for the value 
it provides. 

To help better address their cyber security needs, 
76% of organizations are planning cyber security 
budget increases for 2020 with most indicating 
planned increases of 1\-9% over the current 2019 
cyber security budget which, on average, is 
equivalent to 6\-7% of the overall IT budget. 

Security Approaches 

Finding a balance between cyber security and 
operational requirements is a challenge for 63% of 
organizations. 

In the US, 51% of organizations believe cloud is more 
secure than their on\-premise environment however 
globally, 60% of organizations prefer an on\-premise 
email system to cloud\-based. 

Globally, 88% of organizations have active initiatives 
related to the use of artificial intelligence and 86% 
have active initiatives on the use of block chain. 

Preparation and Staffing 

Globally, 51% of organizations do not believe they are 
ready or would respond well to a cyber attack or breach 
event. Nearly 29% of organizations who have cyber 
attack and breach response plans have not tested or 
updated their plans in 12 or more months. Over 40% of 
organizations do not have or have only very limited as\-
needed cyber security training for their employees. 

While 91% of organization currently have or are planning 
to obtain cyber security insurance in the next 18 months, 
56% of organizations who currently have cyber security 
insurance thought it difficult to find and overall 
expressed concerns over the value it provided. 

Nearly 60% of organizations globally do not have a 
security information and event manager (SIEM) within 
their environments. 

The average staffing of a security operations center 
(SOC) is 11\-30 people and 60% of organizations who 
have a SOC are planning to grow this staffing level over 
the next 18 months. Germany has over 250% more 
organizations that do not have a SOC than the global 
average. 

Views on Attacks 

Organizations believe the most likely attribution for the 
attacks they experienced over the past 12 months are 
hacker groups, individual hackers and criminal 
organizations. Globally, nation states were considered 
the least likely source of cyber attacks. Only in South 
Korea were they considered one of the top three most 
likely sources.

Methodology and Participants 

This research study was commissioned by FireEye and delivered 
by KANTAR, an independent market research organization. The 
results were derived from an online survey fielded in July and 
August of 2019 for a total of over 800 responses spanning across 
North America (US and Canada), Europe (France, Germany and 
the UK) and Asia (China, Japan and South Korea). 

Setup questions were used to ensure that only cyber security 
executives were in the sample. The findings represent the views 
from three senior organizational roles with 45% of participants at 
C\-level an above, 17% at the vice president level and 38% at the 
senior director level. The participants were 68% men and 32% 
women. Canada had the largest percentage of women 
participants (42%). 

 Higher education was universally valued with 46% of all 
participants possessing university degrees and a further 34% 
indicating they had also completed graduate studies.

Analyst Observation 

While the reporting of industries 
and size of the participating 
organizations in Japan and 
Germany were consistent with 
global data, and thus not 
creating a bias in the survey in 
these countries towards the 
concerns, issues or operations of 
a particular type of organization, 
14% of participants from Japan 
and 12% from Germany reported 
that their organizations lacked 
any of the formal roles identified 
in the study, contrasting sharply 
with an average of less than 3% 
for similar responses from each 
of the other regions.

Assessing and Addressing Cyber Risks 

Organizations were asked to provide their assessment of the 2020 
cyber security threat landscape and their plans for addressing cyber 
risks. This included insights into: 

• Their cyber security budgets and the focus of their risk 

mitigation strategies. 

• Their assessment of the performance and value of cyber 

security solutions and of government and regulatory agencies. 

• The most likely and most vulnerable targets of cyber attacks. 

• The most likely source of cyber attacks they experienced over 

the past 12 months. 

The overall perception of the outlook for cyber risks in 2020 by global 
participants was grim with 56% believing that it would worsen over 
the next 12 months and 33% were of the opinion it would stay the 
same. The most pessimistic participant views were from U.S. (74%) 
and Japan (72%) where risks from cyber threats were expected to 
worsen over the next 12 months.

Participants also believed that cyber threats were becoming more 
difficult to understand and defend against. Responses 4 and 5 (“more difficult”) accounted on average a total of 70% of 
responses globally. However, in Canada and Korea, 84% of respondents chose responses 4 and 5, signaling increased 
concerns in these countries over the evolving complexity of the cyber threat landscape. 

Balancing Cyber Security and Operations 

Organizations universally reported that it was more difficult to find 
a balance between cyber security and operational requirements 
with 14% reporting it to be very difficult and 49% difficult. Only 14% 
of organizations found it easy and 3% found it easier to find a 
balance. Globally, 18% of organizations were neutral on the issue. 

Participants from Japan reported that 54% of their organizations 
found it difficult and 18% very difficult to find a balance between 
cyber security and operational requirements as did organizations in 
Germany with 53% reporting difficult and 13% more difficult. 

In France, 26% of organizations reported that it was neither easier 
nor more difficult than before to find a balance between cyber 
security and operations requirements. 

There were no significant regional differences for organizations that 
indicated it was easy or easier to find a balance between security 
and operations; they corresponded closely to global results.

Cyber Security Budgets 

When planning to protect themselves against the cyber threat landscape, 78% of organizations reported security 
budgets that were over 6% of the overall IT budget. The largest concentration of responses accounted for 37% of the 
total and identified security budgets in the 6\-7% range.

In the US, 25% of participants indicated 
they had security budgets representing 
a greater than a 10% share of the overall 
IT budget. The largest security budgets 
outside of the US were identified in 
China (19%) and France (16%). 

Japan was the most frugal in terms of 
security budgets with 22% of 
organizations reporting a spend of only 
between 1\-3% of the overall IT budget. 
This is notable, considering that 72% of 
organizations in Japan perceived the 
risks from cyber threats worsening over 
the next 12 months. 

Globally, 76% of organizations reported planning net security budget increases in 2020\. In the U.S., 39% of participants 
were planning security budget increases of 10% or more compared with the UK (30%), Korea (22%), China (17%), France 
(17%) and Canada (13%).

In Japan and Korea, a full 25% of organizations were planning to keep their 2020 security spend at the same level as 2019 
compared with a global average of 13%. 

The only countries where organizations were planning to decrease their security budget by more than 10% were France 
(3%), Japan (3%), Korea (2%) and China (1%). 

Globally, organizations allocated their cyber security budgets into four main categories: prevention (42%), detection 
(28%), containment (16%) and remediation (14%). 

Japan was the only country that changed the order slightly with an emphasis on detection being expressed by 40% of 
organizations followed by prevention (35%), containment (13%) and remediation (12%).

Value of Cyber Security Solutions, Government and 
Regulatory Agencies 

Organizations broadly (57%) believed that the cost of cyber security was reasonable for the value it provides. A further 
25% believed it was inexpensive. Countries perceiving cyber security as inexpensive for the value it provides were Canada 
(42%) and the UK (38%). 

Participants in Japan (29%) and the U.S. (28%) believed cyber security was expensive for the benefits it provides.

Participants offered a mixed view, nearly equally positive and negative, in their 
assessment of technology providers and cyber security vendors, and how well they 
were protecting their environment. 

Only 8% believed that technology providers and cyber security vendors were doing a 
very good job of protecting their environments which is similarly low to the 6% 
assessment for a very bad rating. Nearly matching results were also obtained for 
good with 34% and bad with 30%. Lastly 22% of organizations did not favor a net 
positive or negative assessment. 

Organizations were slightly more positive in their assessment of governments and 
regulatory agencies and how well they were doing at protecting their environments. 

A majority of participants believed governments and regulatory agencies were doing 
a good job (42%) or a very good job (11%). A neutral rating was provided by 19% of 
global respondents. Of the remaining organizations 23% believed governments and 
regulatory agencies were doing a bad job and 4% a very bad job. 

Analyst Observation 

The U.S. expressed the highest 
rate of the most negative views 
of governments and regulatory 
agencies with very bad 
gathering over 15% of the 
views. The U.S. response for 
bad was in line with other 
regions (21%). 

China expressed the most 
negative perception overall 
with 41% reporting a bad job 
4% reporting a very bad job. 

The most positive perceptions 
were from Japan with 54%

Organizations were asked to identify the most likely source of attacks against their organizations. Globally, the results 
were highly consistent across all countries with hacker groups (31%), individual hackers (18%) and criminal organizations 
(17%) coming in as the top three suspects. 

Participants in Japan (25%) and Germany (23%) believed the most likely source of cyber attacks were 
criminal organizations. 

Globally, nation states were considered the least likely source of cyber attacks totaling less than 8% of responses.

Organizational Maturity and Resilience to 
Cyber Threats 

Many factors impact the maturity of an organization’s cyber security program and its ability to be resilient against 
cyber threats. 

Participants were asked to provide their insights into the formative elements of their own cyber security program, 
how the program was developed and how effective their organization was at responding to and addressing cyber 
security issues. 

Participants were also asked to describe their internal challenges to maturing their cyber security program and their 
biggest fears in the event of a breach. 

Security Program Maturity 

When assessing their cyber security programs, 27% of participants characterized them as semi\-formal approaches where 
efforts were mostly compliance\-driven and focused on addressing mandatory regulations, while 24% saw their programs 
as informal where the primary focus was addressing critical issues as they occurred. 

Globally, 23% of organizations reported formal security programs with a broad, risk\-based focus supporting continuous 
optimization of processes and approaches, compared to the U.S. (41%) and China (38%). 

Only 19% of organizations identified their security program as strategic with intelligence data driving investment 
decisions, operational priorities and other critical cyber security factors. 

Overall, 7% of organizations indicated they did not have a cyber security program at all. In Canada, this response 
jumped to 18%.

Cyber Attack and Breach Response Plans 

Cyber attack and breach event response plans are critical for ensuring organizational focus and resilience during a cyber 
security event. 

These plans consist of pre\-established and agreed upon actions, procedures, communications and leadership structure 
invoked in the event of a cyber incident. To minimize delays and distractions, plans also include legal agreements and 
pre\-negotiated contracts with all third\-parties that might augment operations or render assistance during an event. 

Among all organizations excluding those from the U.S., 29% indicated the existence of mature cyber attack and breach 
event response and communications plans that are regularly reviewed and updated. The highest results were from the 
U.S. (62%) and China (39%). 

However, 29% of organizations reported that while they had cyber plans, they had not been tested or updated in 12 or 
more months. 

Over 30% of organizations indicated that cyber attack and breach event response plans were owned and maintained by 
individual businesses or applications and that they were not coordinated within an overall organization\-wide plan. 

While only 8% of organizations did not have any cyber attack and breach event response plans, the results were higher in 
Canada (19%) and Japan (15%).

Figure 19\. Cyber attack and breach response plans. 

Organizations universally identified the chief information officer (CIO) as the 
leading representative involved in the development or review of the cyber attack 
or breach response plan, followed by the chief compliance officer (CCO), IT 
security and finally IT operations staff (Fig. 20\). 

Analyst Observation 

Overall, internal and external legal 
counsel were identified as among the 
roles least involved in the 
development of plans (Fig. 20\). This 
is in sharp contrast to recommended 
industry best practices, given that 
the main focus of legal counsel is to 
protect the organization from and 
minimize its exposure to risks. Legal 
counsel provides guidance on the 
acceptable levels of risks and 
obligations for their organization and 
ensures that legal frameworks are 
adhered to before, during and after a 
cyber attack or breach event to 
mitigate further impact. 

Line of business and business 
operations were consistently and 
universally identified as the least 
involved in the development and 
review of plans. This is notable 
because these groups are considered 
critical stakeholders in plans 
presumably designed to maintain 
business operations during an event.

Organizational Readiness Against a Cyber Attack or Breach Event 

When asked how they would rate their 
organization’s readiness to address a cyber 
attack or breach event, the respondents 
were nearly equally split. Forty\-nine percent 
considered their organization to be fully 
ready with the ability to respond well and 
47% indicated that some portions of their 
organization would be ready, but overall 
they would struggle to respond well. In the 
U.S., 72% of respondents were confident in 
their organization’s readiness to respond 
well to a cyber attack or breach incident, 
sharply contrasting with Japan (24%). 

Fourteen percent of organizations in Japan 
believed they were not ready and would 
not respond well to a cyber attack or 
breach event, which is significantly higher 
than the global average (just over 2%, 
excluding responses from Japan).

Solutions deployed to protect organizations from cyber attacks range in capability, applicable scope and cost to acquire 
and maintain. Organizations were asked which solutions they currently deployed in their organization, which components 
they believed provided the best protection and where they would focus future investments if they had unlimited 
budgets. 

Globally, participants were quite consistent when they identified the components that currently contributed the most 
positive impact to their organization’s ability to prevent a cyber attack or breach. Specifically, vulnerability management 
had an edge over security software (both slightly above 16%). These were followed by employee training (14%) and then 
response plans and security hardware (both slightly above 12%).

Organizations were then asked which component they believed would most positively impact 
their organization’s ability to prevent a cyber attack or breach if they had the opportunity to 
dramatically increase its the budget or presence. 

The results were globally consistent: 15% of organizations believed that increasing the 
investment and presence of vulnerability management solutions within their environment 
would generate the most impactful results, followed by threat intelligence (13\.7%), threat 
hunting (12\.6%) and employee training (12%).

Organizations in France 
believed employee 
training was the cyber 
security investment area 
with the highest potential 
positive impact against a 
cyber attack. Their

Analyst Observation 

Less than 1% of organizations 
in France indicated they did 
not have any cyber security 
training programs, the lowest 
rate among all countries 
included in this study. This 
stands in stark contrast to the 
responses in Germany (25%) 
and Canada (23%) where no 
security training program was 
in place. 

Significant presence of 
advanced cyber security 
training programs was 
reported in the U.S. (48%), UK 
(34%) and China (37%). 

Organizations consistently reported their greatest concern regarding a cyber attack or breach event as the loss of 
sensitive data, followed by customers and business operation disruption. 

In the U.S. the greatest concern was business operations disruption. U.S. organizations were least concerned by the 
possibility of physical damage to real\-world infrastructure.

focused on addressing 
mandatory regulations 
(Fig. 18\). 

 
 
 
Over 56% of organizations reported that they actively 
tested their security posture with automated tools and 
attack simulation, while 37% indicated that they had 
plans to do so in the next 18 months. Only 7% reported 
they currently did not and had no plans to do so in the 
next 18 months. 

The highest reported use of automated tools was by 
U.S. organizations (78%) followed by the UK (70%). The

Security Operations 

A security operations center (SOC) is a centralized group within an organization mandated to monitor and address 
security issues. Participants were asked to provide insights into their overall SOC maturity, staffing and 2020 plans. 

Maturity and Staffing of Security Operations 

On average, only 13% of organizations reported that 
they did not have a SOC. When excluding Germany 
(26%), the global average drops to 10%. 

Slightly more than 45% of organizations reported 
that they had an on\-premise SOC that they staffed 
during business hours on weekdays (8x5\), 23% had 
an on\-premise SOC staffed 8x5 with outsourced 
expertise for off\-hours, 15% had an on\-premise SOC 
staffed 24x7 and 4% reported full outsourcing of SOC 
responsibilities. 

The highest rate of fully outsourced SOCs was 
reported by France (22%).

Security Information and Event Manager 
(SIEM) 

Security information and event management (SIEM) software solutions collect and aggregate security data from 
applications, services and hardware. A SIEM solution can be used to analyze the collected data in real\-time or at a later 
date, by applying filters and search parameters to identify and characterize events and trigger actions. 

Participants were asked to provide insights into their overall SIEM deployments, use cases, challenges and integration 
with other solutions such as security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR). 

SIEM Deployments 

Globally, over 60% of organizations reported no SIEM solution in their environments and 18% of all participants indicated 
they had no plans to deploy a SIEM solution. 

In the U.S. and France, 12% of organizations reported they had two or more SIEM solutions. 

In Germany, 28% of organizations lacked a SIEM and had no plans to incorporate one in their environment. 

In Korea, 58% of organizations planned to add a SIEM to their environment—significantly higher than the global average 
(39%, excluding Korea).

Organizations generally highlighted a balanced planned use for their SIEM solution. There was a slight edge to threat hunting as the main 
use case, followed by compliance. All organizations globally prioritized use cases in roughly the same way, except Korea, where 
compliance and discovering lateral movement from compromised trusted resources were the top two use cases, followed by log 
collection and monitoring in a third\-place tie.

Cyber Threat Intelligence 

Cyber threat intelligence is used by organizations to enhance their security effectiveness, improve decision making and 
reduce business risks. 

This intelligence is built from collection of reports that contain a wide range of information, such as vulnerability data, 
detailed descriptions of tools and techniques used by attackers and comprehensive attribution of a threat actor with a 
full history of their activity and the intent. These reports can be used on their own to assess risks within an environment 
and can also be used in conjunction with SIEM and other cyber security solutions. 

Participants were asked to provide insights into their adoption of threat intelligence subscriptions or feeds as well as their 
perceived utility, value and effectiveness of the intelligence. 

Adoption of Cyber Threat Intelligence Feeds 

Participants reported that 32% of organizations integrated free and paid intelligence feeds with their SIEM. 

In Japan, 18% of organizations neither had nor planned to integrate intelligence feeds with their SIEM—more than three 
times the global average (5%, excluding Japan). 

France (42%) had the highest number of organizations reporting the integration of two or more free or paid intelligence 
feeds through their SIEM solution, followed by the U.S. (32%), Canada (18%) and Korea (18%).

Analyst Observation 

Participants in the U.S. were the 
most positive, reporting that 
30% of organizations found 
existing cyber insurance 
offerings offered good value, 
and 31% indicated they provided 
excellent value. 

Organizations in Canada were 
the most pessimistic, with 53% 
reporting the value cyber 
insurance as poor and a further 
8% indicating very poor. 

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a computer science specialty focused on creating systems and technologies that mimic how 
the human brain learns and adapts to changing conditions. Its goal is to be able to reason, complete tasks and solve 
complex problems even when data elements are not complete. 

Participants were asked to provide insights into their overall readiness for incorporating AI in their environments and for 
their 2020 plans. 

Adoption of Artificial Intelligence 
Over 88% of organizations reported they had initiated AI efforts at some level. 

Globally, 34% of organizations reported they had started projects to understand AI and AI security issues and 28% had a 
preliminary understanding of AI and AI security with pilot deployments. 

Only 12% reported that they had not investigated AI and that it was not a priority at this time. 

U.S. organizations are the most advanced on the path to AI—28% reported a strong understanding of AI and AI security 
concerns and have established a formal approach. The U.K. (15%) and France (11%) were the next most advanced.

Blockchain 

Blockchain is a technology developed for creating distributed, transparent and immutable records or ledgers of data and 
events. Every data element or event recorded using blockchain is linked to both the immediate data element or event 
before it and following it. Each element is coded with its own unique identifier and locked in place using tamper\-proof 
technology. 

Participants were asked to provide insights into their overall readiness for incorporating blockchain in their environments 
and associated 2020 plans. 

Adoption of Blockchain 
Over 86% of organizations reported blockchain initiatives. 

Globally, 30% of organizations had begun an initiative to understand blockchain and related security issues and 27% have 
a preliminary understanding of blockchain security with pilot deployments. 

Only 14% of organizations reported that they had not investigated blockchain and it was not currently a priority. 

U.S. organizations were the most advanced in their path to leveraging blockchain with 29% reporting a strong 
understanding of blockchain and related security with a formal approach. The next most advanced organizations were 
France (13%) and the UK (11%). 

Many countries, including Germany (21%), Canada (17%) Japan (17%) reported that they had not investigated blockchain 
and it was not currently a priority.

Conclusions 

The FireEye Cyber Trendscape report is a detailed point\-in\-time view of the state of cyber security and how 
organizations are responding and adapting to the changing landscape. 

While there were occasional regional nuances with the findings, the most intriguing discovery was how consistent the 
overall views and perspective were across very diverse regions. Organizations had more in common with one other than 
their geographic location, size or industries would suggest. 

We expect the Cyber Trendscape report to provide you with valuable data for 2020 planning and we look forward to 
sharing future editions that include retrospective reviews and emerging trends.
