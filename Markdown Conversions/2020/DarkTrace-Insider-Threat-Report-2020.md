# Insider Threats
## Threat Landscape Series

total cost of insider threat 
attacks in 2020. 
**11.45 million**

**47%**
increase in the number of 
insider threat attacks attacks 
between 2018 and 2020.

This clear lack of visibility points to the failure of 
traditional security tools to respond to the needs of 
today’s dynamic workforce. As employees become 
increasingly mobile and behave unpredictably, 
organizations require a nuanced, self-learning 
approach to cyber security, one which does not rely 
on rules and can detect the subtle anomalies which 
point to an insider acting maliciously.

## Challenges of Identifying  
Insider Threat

Insider attacks are difficult to spot, yet they often have 
the greatest impact on business operations. Malicious 
or compromised insiders can be difficult to identify due 
to their privileged access and knowledge of company 
workings, enabling them to easily evade detection. 
Despite the risk posed by malicious insiders, firms 
struggle to monitor employees and respond to these 
threats. 72% of organizations reported an increase in 
insider attacks last year, according to Cybersecurity 
Insiders’ 2020 Insider Threat Report.

Recent changes to infrastructure and workforce 
habits have complicated the situation. The same 
report notes that more than half of IT professionals 
say migration to the cloud has made it more difficult to 
identify insider threats. When it comes to monitoring 
critical users, only 61% of organizations have visibility 
over privileged accounts.

On top of this, personal mobile devices have 
become a particularly common point of exfiltration 
for both malicious and accidental insiders. Only 13% 
of organizations state that they can detect insider 
attacks that start with these devices.

## Darktrace Immune System
### Cyber AI: Understanding ‘Normal’ to 
Identify Insider Threat

Traditional security tools rely on signatures and 
 
pre-defined lists to keep the ‘bad’ out. This static idea 
of what is ‘good’ and what is not becomes untenable 
against threats which originate from within. As such, 
they leave companies wide open to insider attacks.

Instead, Darktrace works like a human immune 
system, detecting and responding to anomalies 
across the enterprise, no matter when or where they 
emerge. Cyber AI learns the digital DNA of every user 
and device in an organization, and all the contections 
between them, continually revising this understanding 
‘on the job’. Such a contextual approach enables 
Darktrace to detect subtle deviations in behavior, 
applying advanced AI to thwart the targeted attacks 
which inevitably originate inside the business. 

When Cyber AI detects an insider threat, Darktrace 
Antigena responds autonomously to disrupt the 
attack in seconds. In addition, Cyber AI Analyst 
launches 
investigations 
into 
these 
anomalous 
incidents, combining the intuition of a human analyst 
with the speed and scalability of AI, delivering a 92% 
 
time-saving in time to triage.

## Case Study: Threats From The Inside
### Hydrotech, Inc.: Contractor’s Laptop Compromised

On a normal Thursday morning, a contracted instructor turned on their computer 
and connected to Hydrotech’s Wi-Fi network, as they had every morning that 
week to prepare for their upcoming class.

**Figure 3:** *Device connects to the network*

18 seconds later, Darktrace’s AI detected that the laptop was behaving in an 
extremely unusual way, initiating a scan and making anomalous connections to 
other devices in the organization.

With its unique understanding of ‘normal’ for every device, Darktrace recognized 
this as highly anomalous behavior and alerted the security team to the incident. 
The Darktrace user interface, the Threat Visualizer, marked the device in yellow 
and notified the customer via email of the potential breach. 

**Figure 4:** *Device begins network scanning*

**Figure 5:** *The anomalous behavior is highlighted*

As the scanning activity continued and escalated, the Darktrace Immune System 
increased its anomaly score, with the color of the offending device below 
indicating the severity of the threat.

**Figure 6:** *Threat severity is raised as the attack progresses*

In under two minutes, the instructor’s laptop had attempted connections to 
every device on the network which prompted the following image on the Threat 
Visualizer interface, leaving no doubt that there was a problem with the laptop. 

**Figure 7:** *Device attempts total connectivity*

The offending device was promptly taken offline, stopping the threat before it had 
a chance to develop. After investigation, it was concluded that the breach had 
likely originated from a USB drive which was shared with the contracted instructor 
by one of his students the night before.

## Threat Finds: Self-Learning AI in Action
### IoT Compromised by a Third-Party Vendor

In January 2021, a North American company suffered a supply chain attack when 
a technician came in to perform scheduled maintenance on a smart door. As soon 
as their laptop had connected to the control unit, the IoT device was seen making 
highly unusual connections to rare external IP addresses.

Darktrace then detected that the control unit was attempting to download trojans and 
other payloads, as well as mining cryptocurrency with a Monero (XMR) CPU miner. 
The device was using a SMB exploit to make external connections on port 445 while 
searching for vulnerable internal devices using the outdated SMBv1 protocol.

One hour later, the device connected to an endpoint related to the third-party 
remote access tool TeamViewer. After a few minutes, the device was seen 
uploading over 15 MB to a 100% rare external IP.

The attack managed to bypass the rest of the organization’s security stack because 
it was introduced directly from a trusted external laptop, and the IoT device itself 
was managed by the third-party vendor, so the customer had little visibility over it.

Darktrace’s Cyber AI Analyst reported on every stage of the attack, including the 
download of the first malicious executable file. The customer was also alerted via 
a Proactive Threat Notification following a high scoring model breach at 16:59, just 
seven minutes after the attack had commenced.

deviation from the device’s normal 'pattern of life' and results in multiple

### Disgruntled IT Administrator

When a retail organization in the UK was forced to make a series of redundancies 
over the course of a single week, they neglected to take a fired IT administrator’s 
laptop or to delete their corporate account.

The former IT admin logged into one of their SaaS accounts and quickly 
downloaded many sensitive files – including contact details and credit card numbers 
from the customer database. They then attempted to secretly transfer the stolen files 
to a home server via one of the company’s regular data transfer services. 

Because Darktrace dynamically analyzes logins and file access events across 
SaaS services, the AI immediately picked up on on the unusually large file 
downloads and the exfiltration. Even though the disgruntled employee was still 
in the system as a legitimate administrator and used a familiar transfer service, 
Darktrace Cyber AI understood that the user’s behavior within the SaaS platform 
was highly unusual and an indication of a significant threat.

Subsequent investigation revealed that the malicious admin continually sought 
to exfiltrate the stolen SaaS files through several other methods, including 
through an internal server they had used regularly at the company and, as a 
 
last-ditch attempt, through a third-party file transfer service on their endpoint 
device off the VPN. 

While this activity from a supposedly trusted administrator easily evaded both 
traditional solutions and native SaaS security controls, Darktrace Cyber AI 
detected the threatening behavior within seconds. The system instantly alerted 
the security team and provided detailed and precise information about the 
nature of the compromise, prompting them to revoke the admin’s credentials 
and quickly retrieve and secure the data.

### Stopping a Malicious Member of the IT Team 

Darktrace detected and neutralized a malicious insider at a major investment 
firm in South Africa. 

Reconnaissance activity began with a laptop scanning hundreds of internal 
IP addresses to identify which ones were active. It then swept the network 
for the names of responsive machines and scanned them for open channels 
 
of communication.

Cyber AI identified the suspicious behavior as unusual network scanning, 
prompting Darktrace Antigena to enforce the device’s group ‘pattern of life’ for 
one hour, preventing the laptop from deviating from its prior behavior or that of 
its peers. 

A few hours later, the threat returned. The laptop started running commands on 
hundreds of other internal computers in the IP range it had initially identified. This 
involved moving multi-purpose script files and using a remote administration 
tool. Based on its dynamic evaluation of the threat, Darktrace Antigena blocked 
all outgoing connections using the SMB file-transfer channel, instantly containing 
any lateral movement. 

Once the threat had been neutralized, the security team was able to investigate 
and confirm that the laptop belonged to a member of the IT team who had been 
using an illegitimate scanning tool to look for vulnerabilities.

### Caught in the Act

One incident occurred while Darktrace was onsite training a customer. A member 
of the IT team was skeptical about Darktrace’s ability to detect certain activities 
and ended up leaving the room.

Shortly after, Darktrace detected a device that was downloading an unusual 
volume of data from internal servers, and the customer recognized this as 
sensitive information on critical projects and infrastructure. 

The device belonged to the IT member who had left the room, and they were 
immediately called back in to explain themselves. It turned out that the employee 
was attempting to collect information to send to their home server.

### Unauthorized Server Access via the VPN 

A recently terminated employee at a US-based mining company had previously 
been working from home and retained unsanctioned VPN access to the 
company’s network following their termination. With this means of entry, the 
former employee was able to connect to a company server and read more 
than 9,000 files. Darktrace’s Cyber AI detected over 10,000 unauthorized SMB 
actions in total.

While the employee had regularly used this server as a part of their daily role 
at the company, Darktrace identified a surge in connectivity to the server that 
differed significantly from normal. The user then went on to delete at least 
160 files across the products, marketing, customers, internal business, weekly 
reports, transportation, and systems folders.

With the power of Cyber AI, the security team could recognize that this behavior, 
which may have been harmless in another context, constituted a serious insider 
threat. Darktrace was able to supply granular data that showed exactly when 
and where the malicious insider accessed the server, as well as the specific files 
the user read and deleted, allowing the team to see the extent of the attack and 
 
jumpstart remediation.

### Malicious Insider Harvests Data

At a large healthcare provider, two devices began exhibiting signs of highly 
anomalous activity. Not only was the activity unusual, but the devices themselves 
had never been observed across the digital ecosystem before.

Shortly after joining the network, the devices started acting like gateways. They 
funneled internal traffic to pre-determined destinations. The MAC addresses 
of these devices identified them as Raspberry Pi devices: small, inexpensive, 
 
high-performance computers the size of a credit card that are easy to smuggle 
into a system.

The Raspberry Pi computers were communicating with a suspicious external 
website that was made to look like it belonged to the company. However, the 
website was hosted on an alternative server. The redirected users were being 
presented with a fake login page and ‘security survey’ where they were required 
to enter their usernames and passwords.

Darktrace identified the threat in real time, meaning no users fell victim to this 
malicious credential-grabbing attack. The Raspberry Pi devices quickly disappeared 
from the network.

### Crypto-Mining Side Business Under The Floorboards 

Bitcoin mining is very hard to detect, especially when carried out by an insider. 
Most miners use surplus computer capacity at night when offices are closed, but 
others go to more extreme lengths to slip under the radar.  

**Figure 14:** *A sample of models breached by the 
server at the time of this compromise*

At a major Italian bank, Darktrace picked up on puzzling data traffic patterns, 
including servers that seemed to be connecting from a strange IP address in the 
company’s data center. The security team insisted that the servers didn’t exist 
on the asset log. After a lot of back and forth, they allowed Darktrace to come in 
and investigate.

Darktrace traced wires in the data center to 12 servers under the floorboards. It 
turned out that an employee was responsible for installing the servers: they had 
been slowly siphoning them off to set up an extensive bitcoin mining operation 
from within the company.

**Figure 15:** *Cyber-attacks can originate in even the most innocuous places*
