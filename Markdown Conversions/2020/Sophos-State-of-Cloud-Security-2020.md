THE STATE OF 
CLOUD SECURITY 2020
The results of an independent study 
of 3,521 IT managers hosting data 
and workloads in the public cloud

A Sophos whitepaper July 2020THE STATE OF CLOUD SECURITY 2020 

Introduction
Thanks to growing demand for remote working and public cloud services, on\-premises 
infrastructure is shifting from asset to liability. But moving to the cloud comes at a cost: 
increasing every organization’s attack surface. The numerous and well\-publicized breaches 
of data storage services have raised cloud security awareness, but cybercriminals work 
diligently to stay one step ahead.

To understand the reality behind the headlines, Sophos commissioned an independent 
survey of 3,251 IT managers across 26 countries who are using the public cloud. The 
findings provide brand new insights into the concerns for security teams that host data and 
workloads in the public cloud; how attackers are changing the rules to find new ways into 
environments; and how to find the visibility you need – and perhaps the security gaps you 
never knew you had.

About the survey
Sophos commissioned research specialist Vanson Bourne to survey 3,521 IT managers 
currently hosting data and workloads in the public cloud about their experiences with 
cloud security. By public cloud we mean organizations using at least one of the following 
providers: Azure, Oracle Cloud, AWS, VMWare Cloud on AWS, and Alibaba Cloud. In addition, 
they may also have used Google Cloud and IBM Cloud. Sophos had no role in the selection 
of respondents and all responses were provided anonymously. The survey was conducted 
during January and February 2020\.

48% of survey respondents using the public cloud were from small organizations (100\-
1000 employees), and 52% were from larger organizations (1001\-5000 employees). 

Respondents came from 26 countries across six continents:

Executive summary
The survey provides fresh new insights into the experiences of organizations hit by 
cybercriminals in the public cloud, including:

 Ì Almost three\-quarters of organizations hosting data or workloads in the public cloud 

experienced a security incident in the last year. Seventy percent of organizations 
reported they were hit by malware, ransomware, data theft, account compromise 
attempts, or cryptojacking in the last year.

 Ì Data loss/leakage is the number one concern for organizations. Data loss and leakage 
topped our list as the biggest security concern, with 44% of organizations seeing data 
loss as one of their top three focus areas.

 Ì Ninety\-six percent of organizations are concerned about their current level of cloud 

security. Data loss, detection and response, and multi\-cloud management top the list of 
the biggest concerns among organizations.

 Ì Multi\-cloud organizations reported more security incidents in the last 12 months. 
Seventy\-three percent of the organizations surveyed were using two or more public 
cloud providers and reported more security incidents as those using a single platform.

 Ì European organizations may have the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 

to thank for the lowest attack rates of all regions. The GDPR guidelines’ focus on data 
protection, and well\-publicized ransomware attacks have likely led to these lucrative 
targets becoming harder for cybercriminals to compromise in Europe.

 Ì Only one in four organizations see lack of staff expertise as a top concern despite the 
number of cyberattacks reported in the survey. When it comes to hardening security 
postures in the cloud, the skills needed to create good designs, develop clear use cases, 
and leverage third\-party services for platform tools are crucial but underappreciated.

 Ì Two\-thirds of organizations leave back doors open to attackers. Accidental exposure 

through misconfigurations continues to plague organizations. Security gaps in 
misconfigurations were exploited in 66% of attacks (either through attackers exploiting 
a flaw in the web application firewall to access account credentials or attackers taking 
advantage of a misconfigured resource), while 33% of attacks used stolen credentials to 
get into cloud provider accounts.

Part 1: The prevalence of cloud attacks
Seven in 10 organizations have been hit by a cyberattack
Seventy percent of respondents said they had suffered a public cloud security breach in the 
last year. This is extremely worrisome for organizations, with 96% of the 3,521 respondents 
expressing concern about their current level of security across the six major public cloud 
platforms listed, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

Attack levels vary across the globe
Looking at the number of public cloud attacks across the globe reveals interesting 
variations. This is likely due to criminals focusing their efforts where they see the greatest 
opportunity for return. Country\-level analysis also showed differing levels of protection and 
visibility of cloud environments, and awareness of cloud security responsibilities and best 
practices.

Has your organization suffered a public cloud security incident in the last 12 months? Combination of “Yes” answers (“Yes Malware”, 
“Yes, Exposed Data”, “Yes, Ransomware”, “Yes, Account Compromise”, and “Yes, Cryptojacking.” Base 3,521 respondents

 Ì India (227 respondents) tops the list with 93% of organizations reporting being hit by a 
cyberattack in the last year, despite 92% of organizations reporting they had complete 
visibility of all cloud assets. This indicates a lack of complete cyber hygiene, creating 
weaknesses in cloud security configurations which make organizations vulnerable to 
attack.

 Ì This trend of the highest proportion of attacks echoes throughout the Asia\-Pacific 
(APAC) region, with the highest regional rates of exposed data (35%), ransomware 
attacks (37%), and account compromise (33%) among the survey respondents.

 Ì Europe (1259 respondents) may have GDPR to thank for its low attack rate, with 

European respondents suffering the lowest percentage of security incident rates of all 
respondents in the last year. This includes Italy (45%), Poland (47%), Spain (57%), UK 
(61%) and Germany (61%).

A Sophos whitepaper July 2020THE STATE OF CLOUD SECURITY 2020 

The focus on protection of data and well\-publicized ransomware attacks have likely 
led to these lucrative targets being better protected than other regions. As a result, 
Europe shows the lowest rates of malware infections (29%), exposed data (24%), and 
ransomware attacks (22%) among the survey respondents. This also explains the higher 
comparative levels of account compromise incidents (21%) and cryptojacking (15%), as 
attackers move to exploit resource misconfigurations and over\-privileged IAM roles to 
compromise cloud environments.

 Ì Middle East and Africa (360 respondents) has some of the lowest attack rates 

outside of Europe, the result of geo\-targeted attacks that go after the most lucrative 
opportunities. However, value is in the eye of the beholder. Here we see cryptojacking at 
its highest among all regions (22%) as criminals spin up hundreds of virtual servers to 
run illegal cryptomining and escape before being discovered.

 Ì United States (413 respondents) reported surprisingly few incidents despite being the 
largest group of survey respondents. It was in the bottom 35% of countries suffering 
security incidents in the last year. As an advanced, Western country, it could be 
considered a lucrative target, yet only 30% of respondents report being hit by malware, 
31% by ransomware, 28% suffering a data breach, and 21% having account credentials 
compromised. Contributing factors here point to clear ownership of security, with 
90% of organizations understanding their responsibility for cloud security. With 85% of 
organizations being aware of all their cloud assets, the U.S. is a full 17 percentage points 
higher than the global awareness average.

Part 2: How criminals are getting in
Two\-thirds of organizations leave back doors open to criminals
When it comes to the cloud, it’s best to think of a network like a building with multiple 
windows and multiple openings – they all add up to multiple potential access points for 
someone, or something, to get in and out. 

For example, a misconfigured route table on an organization’s firewall leaves the window 
open. Virtual machines running private server workloads or hosting sensitive data suddenly 
become accessible from the internet. 

Accidental exposure continues to plague organizations, and this is reflected in our survey 
responses. Security gaps in misconfigurations were exploited in 66% of attacks, while 33% 
of attacks used stolen credentials to get into cloud provider accounts.

As organizations start to introduce new cloud services in order to provide shared storage, 
containers, database services, and serverless functions, the potential for misconfiguration 
only increases, which in turn expands an organization’s attack surface.

Entry methods vary across the globe
Every organization represents value to a cybercriminal. That value might be in the data that 
can be sold or held onto for ransom. It could also be the organization’s wallet that’s used to 
pay for cryptomining virtual machines. And while in the real world, targeting based on Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) or industry sectors may be the norm, isn’t as clear cut in the cloud.

An organization’s security posture is often the deciding factor when it comes to choosing 
entry methods and weak points (misconfiguration 66%, or credentials 33%). But it’s 
important to realize that though misconfigurations can still give cybercriminals access to 
cloud accounts, such access may last for less time: up to six hours or so when temporary 
credentials are obtained thanks to a resource misconfiguration, for instance. 

Our survey also highlights the role that visibility of cloud assets plays when it comes to how 
an organization is targeted:

 Ì South Africa and Japan showed the highest number of stolen cloud provider account 
credentials in our survey. These organizations also have amongst the highest levels of 
asset visibility across cloud environments, which suggests a stronger security posture 
overall with less chance of misconfigurations.

 Ì Turkey and Poland show the reverse: with the lowest levels of visibility, these 
organizations were most likely to be attacked via misconfigured cloud assets.

Identity security represents a huge challenge
A review of cloud accounts by the Sophos Cloud Optix cloud security posture management 
service discovered worrying trends in organizations’ security posture as it relates to cloud 
account access.

Thirty\-three percent of organizations reported that cybercriminals gained access by 
stealing cloud provider account credentials. Once inside, however, all attacks utilized 
Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and permissions to navigate the compromised 
cloud accounts. Managing access to cloud accounts is an enormous challenge and yet only 
quarter of organizations in our survey saw it as a top area for concern. 

The scale and interwoven nature of individual and group access to services means that 
organizations often simply can’t accurately see how their services can be accessed, and 
this lack of visibility is exploited by attackers.

91%

Had overprivileged 
Identity and Access 
Management roles

98%

Had MFA disabled on 
their cloud provider 
accounts

Why it Matters
Granting extensive access permissions to IAM 
users, groups and cloud services is a risky 
practice. If those credentials are compromised, 
the cybercriminals will have access to any 
services and data those permissions grant.

Why it Matters
All user accounts should have MFA enabled 
to ensure protection against password 
compromises. MFA adds an extra layer of 
protection on top of a username and password.

Part 3: Organizations are not focusing on root causes
The most worrying outcome for organizations is data loss
Data security topped the list as the most likely concern, cited by 44% of respondents. 
The rapid growth of cloud usage has resulted in fractured distribution of data, with 73% 
of organizations now utilizing at least two public clouds platforms. This multi\-platform 
approach compounds the visibility challenge for security teams, who often must switch 
between multiple platforms for a complete picture of cloud assets.

A significant root cause is a lack of cloud expertise
To properly secure a cloud environment, good design and clear use cases are necessary 
in order to leverage platform tools effectively and extend them with third\-party services. 
This requires skilled experts, either employed directly by organizations or available through 
partners. Unfortunately, while 70% of organizations in our survey suffered a security breach 
in the last year, only a quarter see lack of staff expertise as a top concern.

A Sophos whitepaper July 2020The impact of configurations on data security
A review of cloud accounts by the Sophos Public Cloud Security team discovered that 
accidental data exposure through misconfigured storage services continues to plague 
organizations, with 60% leaving information unencrypted. Organizations are making it easy 
for attackers to search for and identify new targets.

Why it matters
Encryption is critical in stopping cybercriminals from seeing and reading stored information, 
and is a requirement for many compliance and security best\-practice standards. While 
“public mode”, a setting that can be applied to databases, shared storage and other cloud 
provider services is a major course of data breaches. Misconfiguring cloud services in 
“public mode” allows cybercriminals to automate their searches for these weak points in 
security. Guardrails should be in place to prevent such misconfigurations.

Most successful ransomware attacks now hit the public cloud
In parallel to this cloud security survey, Sophos recently released a survey of 5,000, IT 
managers that explored their experiences with ransomware. Among those organizations, 
59% of attacks where the data was encrypted involved data in the public cloud. While it’s 
likely that respondents took a broad interpretation of public cloud – including cloud\-based 
services such as Google Drive and Dropbox, and cloud backup such as Veeam – it’s clear 
that cybercriminals are targeting data wherever it’s stored.

The secret to effective cybersecurity across dispersed environments in Amazon Web 
Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform is to improve overall security posture 
and address the most important security aspects. Ensure architecture is secure and 
configured correctly, gain complete architecture visibility, regularly review who has access 
to cloud accounts and services (including permissions levels), and, importantly, ensure 
consistent security management across multiple cloud environments.

Recommendations
Moving from traditional to cloud\-based workloads offers huge opportunities for 
organizations of all sizes, yet this survey has confirmed that securing the public cloud is 
imperative. It also provides insight into how to minimize the risk of a security incident:

1\. Start with the assumption that attackers will find cloud assets. Cybercriminals are 

automating their searches for vulnerable cloud services. Whether an organization has 
used the cloud to host data and workloads for some time or has recently accelerated 
the use of public cloud provider services, accurate visibility of cloud services in use is 
the only guaranteed route to ensure they are configured securely and protected against 
threats.

2\. Invest in cloud workload protection with anti\-malware technology. Seventy percent 

of survey respondents suffered a security incident in the last year. Among that majority, 
34% were hit by malware, 28% hit by ransomware (an advanced form of malware), and 
17% were hit by cryptojacking (which can be malware). These results highlight that 
malware is the number one threat to organizations and the sensitive data they hold. 

3\. Protect data wherever it’s held. Data protection is the highest concern for global 

organizations. Almost 60% of ransomware attacks in the last year that successfully 
encrypted data included data in the public cloud. Cloud strategies should include 
protecting data in the public cloud, private cloud, and on premises.

4\. Continually monitor cloud resource configurations. Two\-thirds of survey respondents 

were compromised through misconfigured cloud resources, allowing attackers to 
exploit these weaknesses to carry out malicious activity. Proactive monitoring of 
configurations by a security team can significantly reduce the likelihood of breaches.

5\. Proactively manage cloud access. On average, IAM roles were compromised in 33% of 
cyberattacks reported by the survey respondents, rising to 59% in specific countries. 
Effective management of individual and group user permissions is key to ensuring over\-
privileged roles are not compromised.

6\. Provide secure remote access for workers. Ensure the same level of protection is in 

place for virtual desktops as it is for other critical server workloads. Virtual desktops run 
on virtual machines, which are susceptible to the same threats. Likewise, as remote 
workers access private applications and sensitive data, they should be equipped with 
VPN access to ensure secure connections.

7\. Deploy a layered defense. Cybercriminals use a wide range of techniques to get around 
defenses. When one is blocked, they move on to the next one until they find something 
a weakness that can be exploited. Make sure to defend against all possible vectors of 
attack. 

8\. Learn responsibilities for securing public cloud provider services. Public cloud 
providers offer a great deal of flexibility. And while they’re responsible for physical 
protection at the datacenter and virtual separation of customer data and environments, 
whatever organizations store or run in the cloud is their responsibility to secure. Almost 
half of survey respondents didn’t fully understand their responsibilities. To find out more, 
visit the Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure websites.
